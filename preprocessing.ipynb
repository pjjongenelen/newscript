       "['In Pennsylvania, Bucks County prosecutors have charged 30-year-old Samantha Jones with criminal homicide. They\\'re saying she killed her 11-week-old son, R.J., by breastfeeding the child while using drugs. CNN reports the child died due to a \"combination of fatal drugs\" that he ingested through breast milk.\\nThe Bucks County Deputy District Attorney Kristin M. McElroy stated Jones could face a murder charge with a mandatory life sentence.\\nLouis Busico, Jones\\' attorney, said she \"absolutely, unequivocally loved that child\" and never meant to harm him.\\nKTLA 5 states that Jones told police she heard R.J. crying around 3. a.m. on April 2. He was normally breastfed, but she had started using formula because she was concerned he wasn\\'t getting enough milk. But she was too tired to make a bottle of formula so she decided to nurse him. Then she fell asleep on and off for the next few hours.\\nEarlier, her husband, Vincent McGovern, had made a bottle of formula before he left for the day. Jones says she remembers feeding R.J., putting him back in his bassinet around 6:30 in the morning, and then going back to sleep.\\nJones says she woke up about an hour later and saw that R.J.\\'s skin was pale and that he had bloody mucus coming from his nose. She and her mother, who also lived in the house, called 911 and began CPR. R.J. was transported to the hospital by EMS, and pronounced dead at 8:30 a.m.\\nThe autopsy showed traces of methadone, methamphetamine, and amphetamine in R.J.\\'s blood and according to experts, this contributed to the child\\'s death. Jones told police she has been prescribed methadone since her pregnancy to help with her opioid addiction. The bottle and the can of formula that was used to feed the child were tested for traces of drugs, but nothing was found.\\nJones is just one of several recent cases where women have been charged with the death because harmful drugs were in their breast milk.\\nSince Jones\\' arrest, her attorney commented on her mental state saying she is \"completely in a state of depression.\" He also went on to add that the arrest kicked her when she was down and already dealing with the death of a child. He declined to comment on her drug use.\\nJone\\'s preliminary hearing was set for Wednesday.\\nAccording to Reuters, this is the latest case in a series of mothers charged for the deaths of their children after they breastfed them while having methamphetamine in their system. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, methamphetamine is used by over 12 million people in the United States. The use of it during pregnancy can lead to premature delivery, heart and brain abnormalities, and other health problems.',\n",

       " 'During the first year an expensive class of new cholesterol-lowering drugs was on the market, only one in three patients with a prescription actually received the therapy due to lack of insurance approval and high copays, according to a study sponsored by a manufacturer of one such drug.\\nThe drugs, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, are intended for use by adults whose “bad” low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels remain dangerously high even though they’re taking maximal doses of traditional cholesterol-lowering medications.\\nBecause PCSK9 inhibitors can cost up to $14,000 per year, insurance companies usually require prior authorization and patient copays.\\nIn the new study, the rate of insurance company approval of PCSK9 inhibitors was 47.2 percent. Ultimately, only 34.7 percent of patients prescribed the medicine ever picked it up due to its high out-of-pocket cost.\\nThe higher the copay, the higher the rate of “prescription abandonment,” the study found. When the copay was more than $350, more than 75 percent of patients didn’t pick up the medication.\\nFor the analysis, published in JAMA Cardiology, researchers examined pharmacy claims data on 45,029 patients prescribed PCSK9 inhibitors in the U.S. in 2015 and 2016.\\nThe two PCSK9 inhibitors approved in the U.S. are Praluent (alirocumab) marketed by Sanofi/Regeneron and Repatha (evolocumab) marketed by Amgen, the sponsor of the current study. Overall, this class of injectable drugs has been shown to lower LDL cholesterol levels by up to 60 percent.\\nTwenty percent of patients in the study received approval from their insurance provider on the first day. Of those whose prescriptions were rejected, 73.5 percent appealed or resubmitted, after which an additional 45.4 percent were approved to receive the medication.\\nMost of the time, PCSK9 inhibitors get denied the first time around, said lead study author Dr. Ann Marie Navar of the Duke Clinical Research Institute in Durham, North Carolina.\\n“Personally, every time I prescribe PCSK9 (inhibitors) it takes me three to six hours of work between filling out forms and being on the phone with insurers. On the aggregate the burden of prescribing it is increasing and becoming quite onerous,” Navar told Reuters Health by phone.\\nDr. Robert Eckel, professor of medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver and former president of the American Heart Association, told Reuters Health that when he prescribes PCSK9 inhibitors, he often hears back from an insurance company with an approval within half an hour.\\n“I know the indications of the drug, how to assess its risk and when I need to push hard,” he said. “I often also explain to my patients upfront that I’m the prescribing physician and not in a position to discuss copays.”\\nNavar noted that cardiologists in the study were more successful than internists or endocrinologists at getting insurance approval, possibly because cardiologists are more likely to pick the right therapy for patients who meet the right criteria for drug approval. Specialty pharmacies that help patients navigate the paperwork process were also more successful.\\nWeaknesses in the study make it impossible to know whether denial of prescriptions was inappropriate, however.\\nFor example, data on use of statins or LDL level were only available for a small subset of participants. Also, Eckel pointed out, there was no information about why approval was declined for some patients. “This is a very important piece of data that’s related to whether the prescribing physicians followed the approved indications for the drug,” he said.\\n“I’m not surprised by what the study found, but I’m not sure who’s at fault here,” Eckel said.\\nDr. Navar has had financial relationships with both Amgen and Sanofi/Regeneron.',\n",

       " 'The House rejected legislation Tuesday easing how experimental drugs are provided to people with terminal illnesses, as Democrats calling the bill risky and misleading overcame support from President Donald Trump and emotional arguments by Republican lawmakers and ailing constituents.\\nThe vote for the measure was 259-140, but that fell short of the two-thirds majority the GOP needed to prevail under special procedures. Since the Senate approved similar legislation last August, Republicans could revisit the legislation under rules that would require only a simple majority for passage, perhaps after reworking the measure.\\n\"The House will not let this be the end,\" said Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\\nRepublicans brought patients with fatal diseases to the House chamber, including Jordan McLinn, 7, of Indianapolis, a muscular dystrophy sufferer who sat beside Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden, R-Ore. McLinn appeared two years ago with then Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, now vice president, as Pence signed state legislation reducing restrictions.\\nRep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., cited a message from fellow Pennsylvanian Matthew Bellina, a Navy veteran diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also called Lou Gehrig\\'s disease. Bellina\\'s message was, \"A vote against this is essentially a vote to kill me.\"\\nAll but two voting Republicans backed the measure while Democrats were opposed by a margin exceeding 4-to-1.\\nDemocrats, backed by scores of patients\\' and research organizations, said the bill would achieve little since the federal Food and Drug Administration already approves 99 percent of the 1,000 requests it receives annually for an existing program that lets patients use unproven treatments. They said the proposal would create risks by rolling back the FDA\\'s oversight role in the process and noted that most experimental drugs don\\'t work.\\n\"The last thing I want to do is give patients false hope and to put them at risk\" by reducing the FDA\\'s powers, said Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce panel.\\nGOP lawmakers rejected that argument.\\n\"There is no such thing as false hope. You either have hope or you have no hope,\" said Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.\\n\"If I had a terminal diagnosis, I\\'d even consider injecting monkey urine if I thought it would give me a few more months, a few more years with my children,\" said Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Va.\\nUnder the \"Right to Try\" legislation, the FDA would no longer need to sign off if a doctor and pharmaceutical maker agree that a patient with no other options should try an experimental treatment.\\nThe agency would have to be notified after treatment begins, manufacturers would have to report if problems arose and drug makers and doctors would be broadly shielded from legal liability. Manufacturers would still not be required to provide their pharmaceuticals.\\nMore than 70 patient and research groups sent a letter of opposition Monday to House leaders saying the bill \"would not increase access to promising therapies\" and \"is still less safe\" that the FDA\\'s existing process.\\nCritics said the measure misleadingly suggests the FDA is the bottleneck to providing the experimental treatments. They say the more common hurdle is manufacturers, which often prefer to use their limited quantities of early-stage drugs for clinical trials needed to gain final FDA approval for wide-spread sales or worry that a setback could damage the product\\'s marketability.\\nScott Gottlieb, FDA commissioner and a Trump appointee, told Congress in October that 70 percent of the experimental drugs his agency currently lets seriously ill patients use are never approved.\\n\"The vast majority of people\" granted access to unproven treatments \"are using a drug that doesn\\'t work,\" he said.',\n",

In a priority resolution they hope will be adopted at the Liberals\\' policy convention in April for inclusion in the next election platform, the national caucus is calling on the government to eliminate criminal penalties for simple possession and consumption of all illicit drugs.\\nNewly-minted NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has taken a similar stance.\\nBut the Conservatives, who have opposed many elements of the plan to legalize pot by July, are signalling that they would object to decriminalizing the use of other, harder drugs even more strenuously.\\n\"The Conservatives haven\\'t been satisfied or in any way pleased with what they\\'re doing in the area of marijuana. I think it\\'s going to be a complete mess in this country,\" Conservative justice critic Rob Nicholson said in an interview.\\n\"That being said, to expand this ... to do anything that does anything except discourage people from taking opioids and strong drugs I think is a mistake,\" he added.\\n\"If you\\'re saying it\\'s OK to consume this, you\\'re not sending out the message here that this is a huge problem that tears families apart, destroys peoples\\' health, decreases the safety within this country. Because who\\'s going to be providing them with this? These are the criminal elements.\"\\nMany Conservatives feared legalization of pot would be just the first step towards legalizing other, harder drugs. But Nicholson said he\\'s frankly surprised that Liberal MPs aren\\'t even waiting to see how legalizing cannabis works out before starting down that slippery slope.\\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau has repeatedly ruled out legalization of drugs other than cannabis. He has not so far commented on the resolution advanced by his own caucus, which does not actually go so far as to advocate legalization of other drugs.\\nRather, the caucus is proposing that Canada adopt the model that has proven successful in Portugal in significantly reducing overdose deaths, decreasing illicit drug use and reducing the social cost of drug abuse.\\nSince 2001, Portugal has expanded treatment and harm reduction services, such as safe injection sites, and eliminated criminal penalties for simple possession and consumption of all illegal drugs. A person found in possession of a drug for personal use is no longer arrested but ordered to appear before a \"dissuasion commission\" which can refer the person to a treatment program or impose administrative sanctions.',\n",
       " '• Well-known psychiatrist says “psych meds” cause violence in too many users\\nBy Ralph Lopez\\nPsychiatrists have come forward to assert that certain psychiatric medications, such as those known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are almost certainly the chemical cause of a high number of instances of random violence and suicide in which SSRIs have been present.\\nThe research challenges the pharmaceutical industry’s defense that the high correlation between random violence and the presence of these medications is due to the mental illness itself, not the drugs being prescribed for the illness. Other critics of the industry claim that drugs tend to be too aggressively marketed and over-prescribed.\\nThe media has reported that the suspected shooter in the Sandy Hook multiple killings, Adam Lanza, was possibly on some form of psychiatric medication, perhaps related to a reported diagnosis of a form of autism, a developmental disorder that affects social and communication skills. Authorities have yet to make a statement on what, if any, psychiatric medications Lanza was on or had been on in the past. The SSRI with the brand name Prozac is sometimes prescribed for autism.\\nAnswering the pharmaceutical industry’s defense, in testimony before the House Committee on Veterans Affairs in February 2010, Dr. Peter Breggin, founder of the International Center for the Study of Psychiatry and Psychology, told the committee that the causative links between violent incidents and the drugs in question had already been established by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\\n“The pharmaceutical industry has attempted to discredit case reports as evidence for causation,” Breggin told the committee. “However, case reports have led to most FDA changes in labels and to most withdrawals of psychiatric drugs from the market, and are a mainstay in the FDA for evaluating adverse drug reactions.\\n“There is overwhelming evidence that the SSRIs and other stimulating antidepressants cause suicidality and aggression in children and adults of all ages,” he added.\\nBreggin made the news in 1987 when a group calling itself the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) filed a complaint with Maryland’s Commission on Medical Discipline for comments he made on the Oprah Winfrey show. The New York Times and Mother Jones magazine subsequently found that NAMI received up to 66% of its funding from the pharmaceutical industry. In 2009, Senator Charles Grassley (R-Ia.) opened an investigation of NAMI, which confirmed the Times and Jones reports.\\nBreggin drew the wrath of the pharmaceutical industry when he commented: “Find the little part in you that loves yourself and see if you’re being loved by your therapist. See if that person cares for you, supports you. If that person offers a drug, don’t even say, ‘No, thank you.’ You can take the prescription and go. Don’t fight about it, don’t get in trouble, but go. Don’t take the drugs. And relate to people who care for you as a person.”\\nThe Maryland Commission cleared Breggin and then thanked him for his contribution to mental health in Maryland.\\nAdding to the controversy over the links between SSRIs and violence and suicide, Dr. David Healy, a British psychiatrist and author of the book Pharmageddon, said in November 2012, “Violence and other potentially criminal behavior caused by prescription drugs are medicine’s best kept secret.”\\nThe psychiatric profession and pharmaceutical industry have come under fire for the practice of giving doctors significant financial incentives for prescribing certain medications.\\nDr. Gary G. Kohls, in an article entitled “Batman Shooter and His Psyche [sic] Drugs” published in Evergreene Digest, lists at least 40 cases of violent crimes or suicides committed by mostly young people whose medical history revealed the presence of psychiatric drugs, mostly SSRIs.

All the problems and issues of America have been set aside by the tragic shooting in the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., and rightfully so.\\nThe outcry is to limit the firepower of guns. Even the National Rifle Association (NRA) was at first silent, seemingly on the defense. It seems that the NRA is now being scrutinized regarding their political donor list and the money they invest in certain politicians.\\nI find it interesting that most of those politicians who have eaten at the trough of the NRA are not only silent, but are also joining the mob that is now putting the NRA under the microscope. This, folks, describes real politics in America.\\nHere’s how it works: The politicians in Washington, D.C. wake up, walk to the window and look out to see in which direction the mob is marching. Then, they put on their trench coats and run out, fighting to get in front of the pack.\\nI have never received any political action funds from the NRA. I was an avid hunter and gun owner but was opposed by the NRA because I was against the sale of armor-piercing ammunition. I guess that was one of the NRA’s litmus tests.\\nEvidently, I failed the strict litmus test and was not worthy of NRA support. The truth is, I was one of the biggest supporters of gun rights and the Second Amendment, and I still am.\\nGuns are not the problem. Gun violence is but one of the symptoms depicting the sad state of affairs in our nation. The trouble is, no one is looking at the symptoms. Instead they are unable to treat the disease that just continues to grow.\\nHere are some of the underlying problems facing our country. Today, less than 50 percent of families have two parents. Many children are being raised by grandparents. Our national policies actually reward dependency, as well as subsidizing illegitimacy. Homes are without fathers, which eventually lead to children without guidance or supervision. Students do not learn in or attend school. High school dropout rates continue at a high level. Juvenile delinquency is accepted. Alcoholism, drugs and teen pregnancy are on the rise.\\nMurder is even tolerated. Don’t believe it? Think back to Richard Speck. He’s the monster who killed eight nurses in Illinois. He was sentenced to life in prison.While in prison, he made a sex movie and stated, “If people knew how much fun I was having they would [expletive deleted] their pants.” Speck should’ve been put to death. And he’s not the only one. How many mass murderers are in prison getting three square meals, healthcare and dental care, with no bills to pay? What’s the message that is being delivered? America tolerates murder, even mass murder—that’s the message.\\nCheck out your TV.Watch those video game advertisements that show shooters killing scores of “bad guys.” Our nation promotes violence, then coddles it. As long as kids run the streets without parental guidance, America will continue to own the killing fields of our dangerous streets.\\nConcealed Carry in Schools Can Prevent Mass Murder\\nBy Mark Anderson\\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is back in the saddle, saying she will be pushing in the 113th Congress the “assault weapons” ban, which was first enacted in 1994 and then expired in 2004. Note to Dianne: the criminal element will still obtain what it needs via theft and through the black market,which your prohibition would help create, enabling criminals to outshoot law-abiding citizens, whose firepower is reduced by this bill.\\nSen. Feinstein’s office says she wants to stop “the sale, transfer, importation and manufacturing of more than 100 specifically named firearms as well as certain semiautomatic rifles, handguns and shotguns that can accept a detachable magazine and semiautomatic rifles and handguns with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds.” She also wants to ban the large-capacity ammunition magazines and drums “capable of accepting more than 10 rounds.”\\nThis approach puts the citizenry at a distinct disadvantage against rogue government forces, instead of addressing the need to create a reasonable balance of power between citizens and police, who should partner together to protect the community, instead of being possible adversaries—which the bill encourages.\\nThose of Sen. Feinstein’s ilk have no problem with guns of the deadliest power and capacity being used to protect themselves and to enforce the edicts of the IRS, FBI, BATFE and other federal agencies. They also have no problem using these weapons to deliver deadly force abroad against the helpless, on the wings of the military. Only honest, average citizens are expected to beat their swords into plowshares, while several federal agencies buy millions of rounds of deadly hollow-point ammunition for reasons never clearly explained.\\nIf the absence of guns ends violence, then why allow guns at the Pentagon, for airport security or anywhere else? Why not dissolve the military and federal goon squads? Why are schools singled out with a federal gun-free designation? Not allowing teachers, administrators and staff to be sufficiently trained and armed is itself a handmaiden to criminality, a form of criminal negligence.\\n“Assault weapons” the public can buy are just ordinary caliber firearms reconfigured to make them look more menacing than they are. The only difference is their capacity to hold multiple rounds in a detachable magazine. Regular citizens can only get such rifles that fire one round per trigger pull. Three-shot-burst and fully automatic weapons are reserved for the police and military.\\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA), meanwhile, advises hiring even more police to guard schools. The big media treat the NRA as if it’s the only pro-gun organization on Earth, and all we get is the NRA’s lackluster proposal to send more uniformed police into schools that already resemble mini police states with RFID chips in student IDs and metal detectors and cameras everywhere.\\nBecause today’s police are highly militarized in their tactics, equipment and mental outlook, neither Sen. Feinstein’s approach nor the NRA’s proposal will do.\\nInstead, let’s repeal the gun-free-schools law and allow licensed and trained law-abiding citizens to carry their concealed arms into formerly forbidden places. That’s what Michigan attempted to do, but the bill was vetoed by the governor. American citizens could back up a limited police force at schools and elsewhere.\\nMark Anderson is AFP’s roving editor.

       " 'Photo: medicalxpress.com\\nSubstance abuse and mental disorders in kids\\nBy Tracey Maxfield\\nSubstance abuse and mental health problems often seem to go together.\\nThat poses the question, which comes first, the chicken (mental illness/disorder) or the egg (substance use)?\\nSome mental disorders such as anxiety, depression and bipolar disorder may contribute to substance use and addiction.\\nSimilarly, substance use and addiction can contribute to the development of a mental disorder such as depression. When a child/teenager has a mental disorder and a substance use disorder, it is called a dual diagnosis.\\nTreatment and management of a dual diagnosis is very specialized and intensive as both the substance use and mental disorder must be treated.\\nIt is important to note, that if a child/teenager is diagnosed with bipolar disorder and substance use disorder, when the substance use stops and is managed appropriately, the mental disorder will not suddenly disappear.\\nMental disorders and substance use disorder have a strong environmental connection. Some studies suggest that environmental factors interact with genetic vulnerability during the developmental stages and can increase the risk of mental disorder and/or substance use disorder.\\nMany environmental factors are associated with an increased likelihood of a child/teenager developing a mental disorder and a substance use disorder e.g. traumatic events, chronic stress, ACEs (Adverse Childhood Events).\\nFor example, kids with PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) may turn to drugs or alcohol to reduce anxiety, numb the pain and avoid dealing with the traumatic event.\\nFurthermore, certain mental disorders increase the likelihood of a child/teenager developing a substance use disorder e.g. depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia.\\nMany areas of the brain are affected by substance use disorder. For example, the frontal lobe, which is involved in risk taking, impulse control, decision-making and emotional responses, can be affected by addictive substances such as alcohol and opioids.\\nOpioids are known to create an initial high, however, long-term, their continued use increase depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts.\\nWhen a child or teenager develops a mental illness, depending on where the changes occur in the brain pathways it may increase vulnerability for the use of substances by enhancing the effects of the frontal lobe:\\nreduces awareness\\ndulls feelings of sadness,\\nnegativity\\nalleviates unpleasant symptoms and/or the side effects of prescribed medication.\\nIt has been suggested that many kids with severe, mild or subclinical mental disorders may use drugs as a form of self medication.\\nSome drugs such as opioids, benzodiazepines can reduce the signs and symptoms of a mental disorder; however, the effect is only temporary and over time, the drugs will exacerbate the signs and symptoms and create a vicious cycle.\\nFor example, a teenager with social anxiety disorder takes Xanax to help her relax. When the anxiety returns, she takes more but the anxiety keeps returning and is getting worse, so she increases the dose of Xanax and this cycle continues until the teenager is unable to function without taking dangerously high amounts of Xanax constantly.\\nContinued use of alcohol and drugs will inevitably result in depression and increased suicide risk.\\nA child/teenager who has a mental disorder and substance use disorder, the risk of suicide is five to six times higher.\\nOne third of teenagers who died by suicide were intoxicated.\\nResearch shows that kids with ADHD, ODD, CD are more predisposed to use drugs, sniff glue or gasoline, while kids with depression, bulimia, anxiety, PTSD, schizophrenia tend to abuse drugs such as fentanyl, heroin and/or alcohol.\\nThere is also a strong association between cigarette smoking, depression and schizophrenia.\\nTeenagers and young adults with schizophrenia have higher rates of alcohol, tobacco and drug use disorders compared to teenagers with other mental disorders.\\nOther factors that can contribute to substance use and mental disorders include:\\nBullying\\nStigma\\nSide effects of psychiatric medications\\nMisuse of prescription medications\\nSome research studies have found that mental disorder may precede a substance use disorder, suggesting that better diagnosis of mental disorders in kids, may help reduce comorbidity.\\nWhat can you do?\\nDo not overreact, become angry, threatening or judgemental\\nSeek first to understand, why is your child/teenager using drugs/alcohol, what is the appeal?\\nEnsure any medications, alcohol are stored in a safe location\\nTalk with and listen to your child/teenager. Be understanding, objective and supportive, show love\\nSeek medical help e.g. physician, treatment centre, counselling\\nWork together as a team, a family\\nIf you suspect your child/teenager is using substances\\nCheck medications, alcohol in home, is any missing?\\nObserve body language and behaviour e.g. mood swings, isolation, declining grades, locking bedroom door\\nCheck computer, phone and monitor on-line sites visited\\nIs money or items in home missing\\nAre there any new friends in life\\nFollow up with school, friends, family\\nLook for drug paraphernalia\\nIs there an increase in mail, parcels for child/teenager\\nTalk with a physician, counsellor, substance abuse specialist\\n?\\n?Tracey Maxfield is a nurse, speaker, author, peer specialist and mental health/stop bullying advocate and educator.

In the audience were those who deal with drug addicts, their parents and a few recovering addicts themselves.\\nThe themes heard in Placek\\'s story were repeated by both the professionals, those who have been through treatment, and the parents of addicts.\\nIt\\'s too hard to get into treatment;\\nTreatment is often over too soon;\\nThere\\'s little or no follow up, and if you\\'re off drugs, you can\\'t get treatment even if you still feel you need it;\\nOpiate-based drugs are easier than ever to get and more widespread in the community than ever before.\\nIt was the same story for Mary Flippi, a mother of five. Two of her sons are addicts.\\nFor one son, his first experience with drugs was at age 11. A friend introduced him to marijuana. She said by the time he was 15, he was addicted to heroin. By the time he was 22, he had overdosed three times.\\nTo get him into rehab one time, she called every facility in Western New York she could find. Then she drove around Pennsylvania trying to find a facility to admit him. Finally, he found treatment for her boy in Louisiana.\\n\"He was there for seven months, but within the first hour of him leaving, he relapsed,\" Flippi said. \"He was at the airport waiting for his plane and the anxiety got to him. He went to the bar and spent the $10 they had given him for the trip home.\"\\nFlippi observed, \"drugs are not the problem for the addict. Reality is the problem for the addict.\"\\nAs he continued down the path of renewed drug use, Flippi again tried to find a treatment facility that would take him.\\nJohn Bennett, director of GCASA\\nEventually, she became so desperate that after he stole a dirt bike from his own family, she had him arrested just so he could go to jail while she continued to work on getting him into treatment.\\nLater, Boyle would recall this statement and remark, \"It\\'s a story we\\'ve heard repeatedly around the state. A parent is put in a position where she must have her child arrested to get him into treatment. That is a system that truly needs reform and that\\'s what we\\'re doing here.\"\\nAfter jail, Flippi\\'s son was placed in a 28-day treatment program, but within a week of his release, he was drinking again. Four days ago, he tested positive for heroin and cocaine.\\n\"I\\'m at my wit\\'s end,\" Flippi said. \"I don\\'t know where to go from here, because there is no place. There are placed to go, but they are no help. Twenty-eight days doesn\\'t work, and just to get to 28 days, you have to fail in outpatient first before you even get 28 days.\"\\nSheriff Gary Maha said heroin and opiate use is a significant and growing problem in Genesee County.\\nMost of the drugs sold here come out of Rochester.\\nHeroin is a growing problem because it\\'s cheaper than pain pills. He said he\\'s heard of people selling their pills for $25 and more per pill so they could buy heroin at $10 to $20 a bag.\\n\"A few years ago, heroin was unheard of in Genesee County,\" Maha said. \"Now it\\'s very prevalent and very available. Half the buys by our Local Drug Task Force now involve heroin.\"\\nAfter the meeting, Maha said he thought it was an important discussion.\\n\"What I heard today was very enlightening, even for me as somebody who has been in the business a long time,\" Maha said. \"When you hear from the families of the addicted persons, even the recovering addicts, it kind of opens your eyes. We look sometimes strictly from a law enforcement perspective, not even thinking about the treatment and the education parts, but it\\'s going to take a concerted effort by everybody to fight this thing. It\\'s a difficult and complex issue.\"\\nWhere heroin used to the drug of last resort for the most addicted junkies, said Bennett, it\\'s now part of the potential mix for first time and novice drug users.\\nTeens use heroin, but more commonly, they raid grandma\\'s medicine cabinet and swipe her pain pills.\\n\"They\\'re getting together on Friday nights and they think they\\'re just having fun, but what we know about opiates is, if you use them for two or three weeks -- and some of these kids are popping them every day thinking that\\'s just what grandma is taking -- that when they try to stop, they find they are getting sick, so they start taking pills before going to school just so they don\\'t get sick.\"\\nAugusta Welsh, director of community services, Genesee County Mental Health Services, said she\\'s a big fan of drug take-back days hosted by local police agencies.\\n\"One thing we see kids doing is they will take anything and everything just to try it,\" Welsh said. \"They call it fishing They will put all of the pills they got from their grandmothers\\' and put them in a bowl and say, \\'look at all the pretty colors,\\' then they\\'ll pull something out. If they take it with alcohol, then it delivers the effect much quicker.\"\\nWith the rise of heroin and opiate-based drugs in Genesee County, UMMC\\'s emergency room has been much busier, said Mary Beth Bowen, chief nursing officer.\\nShe said in 2013, ER admitted 62 overdose patients. There have been 130 so far this year. Now that number includes all brands of ODs, including alcohol, but the underlying root cause is heroin and pain medications, she said.\\nWhat UMMC is also starting to see is more use of e-cigarettes as a drug delivery method, and several panelists and audience members expressed concern about e-cigs as a kind of gateway into drug use or tobacco cigarettes.\\nAudience member Nicholas Burk, a resource officer at Batavia High School, said he one time he witnessed a BHS student beg her mother for an e-cigarette. This was a girl, he said, who was a athlete-scholar, a straight-A student who never received a referral in her life.\\nAll of her friends had e-cigs, she said, so she wanted to be part of the crowd.\\n\"She thinks it\\'s OK,\" he said.\\nThere was a lot of back and forth about whether marijuana is a gateway drug. Some in the audience are convinced it is.\\nRose Mary Christian expressed shock and dismay that the Legislature would even consider medical marijuana. Ranzenhofer said it\\'s a complex issue. It\\'s hard to turn down a parent who says marijuana is the only drug that will stop her child\\'s seizures and prevent almost certain death.\\nBoyle said there\\'s a lot of discussion in Albany about medical marijuana, but he promised that recreational marijuana will never be legal in New York.\\nDr. Bruce Baker, medical director for GCASA, said the data doesn\\'t support the notion of marijuana as a gateway drug, but it does lower inhibitions and many young people have been introduced to harder drugs just because marijuana brought them into closer contact with people already using harder drugs.\\nTwo recovering addicts also spoke. One was a woman currently living in Batavia who said she got into prostitution to support her drug habit and has seen other young women fall into the same trap. She wants to warn young women away from drugs for that reason. She was among the speakers who complained about how difficult it is to get into drug treatment.\\nOne speaker challenged the panel to look at the people in the room talking about addiction and how it affected their lives personally. It was largely a white, rural and middle-class audience.\\n\"This is the face of addiction,\" She said. \"We are very typical people and I hope we can give it a voice and get more help in our community because it\\'s here and it\\'s big.\"\\nBoyle said the message was heard loud and clear, and with modern technology being what it is today, changes are already in the works.\\n\"As we\\'ve been talking, I\\'ve been texting with my staff in Albany about what some of you have been saying,\" Boyle said. \"They\\'ve already done the research and sent back some draft legislation that we could introduce as soon as next week to address some of the concerns raised here.\"',\n",
       " 'Widespread loss of commercial insurance is expected to put financial pressure on drugmakers, and it comes at a particularly challenging time for AbbVie. The North Chicago-based company has less than three years to pad sales before its top-selling Humira loses U.S. market exclusivity. In addition to facing lower reimbursements for expensive treatments, AbbVie has had fewer new patients start its drugs during the pandemic. And it\\'s integrating newly acquired Botox-maker Allergan at a time when many cosmetic procedures have been sidelined by the coronavirus.\\nPLUNGE PREDICTED\\nCOVID-19 could derail AbbVie\\'s efforts to offset a plunge in sales when Humira knockoffs hit the U.S. in 2023. Piper Sandler analyst Christopher Raymond predicts that Humira sales will drop by about $10 billion by 2025.\\nThe pandemic \"is going to make it a lot harder to milk the last extra few billion dollars out of the drug,\" says Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\\'s Ross School of Business. \"Think about how big Humira is. A disappointing final couple of years of sales could be a disappointment that\\'s counted in billions.\"\\nAbbVie cited a potential decrease in commercially insured patients and an increase to its patient assistance programs when it cut projected 2020 earnings per share by 6 cents to a range of $7.60 to $7.70.\\n\"By the time we get to the third quarter, we should have a pretty good feel for whether or not that\\'s going to play out the way we thought, or if it\\'s going to be better than what we thought,\" CEO Richard Gonzalez said at a health care conference this month.\\nBut even as states reopen and some people return to work, the economic impact of the pandemic is still unfolding. About 27 million people could lose their employer-sponsored health insurance due to job loss between March 1 and May 2, according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation analysis. This includes people who lose their own coverage, as well as those who are covered as dependents.\\nAmong those who become uninsured after a job loss, KFF estimates that 13 million people would be eligible for Medicaid and 8 million would be eligible for reduced premiums under Obamacare. And if recently unemployed people don\\'t get new jobs before unemployment insurance ends for many in January 2021, an additional 4 million could qualify for Medicaid.\\nSeveral drugmakers, including Eli Lilly and Novartis, addressed the concern during first-quarter earnings calls, acknowledging that a drop in commercially insured patients could squeeze sales. Eli Lilly Chief Financial Officer Joshua Smiley said, \"In general, a move from a well-insured commercial patient to Medicaid is a net negative.\"',\n",

Anything.\\nContinue Reading Below Advertisement\\nIncluding giving people straight-up heroin.\\nBayer\\nContinue Reading Below Advertisement\\nThe idea behind most forms of drug treatment is to slowly wean addicts off of their dependence. Because it's done in a controlled setting, you reduce the risk of accidental overdose and the toxic effects from tainted drugs. Though it isn't always practical or advisable to wean addicts off of their drug of choice using the exact same substance. For example, with people addicted to opiates and opioids, we usually use methadone, but that treatment has a number of limitations. In fact, recent research has suggested that, at least when compared to methadone, heroin-assisted treatment (HAT) methods may have better results. (In related news, we now have a new favorite inappropriate acronym. Step aside, Pederasts Under Punitive Prosecution for Youth-Crimes.)\\nContinue Reading Below Advertisement\\nIn one study, researchers found that opioid addicts treated with heroin improved in both health and social stabilization, reducing their drug use at levels superior to similar methadone treatment programs. Even more interestingly, after four weeks, there were no detectable intoxication effects -- subjects could have potentially been able to drive after dosing up. Nobody wanted to be the first to hand them the keys to the school bus or anything, but still, that's theoretically impressive.\\nHeroin-assisted treatment is already a thing in some parts of the world. In both England and Switzerland, doctors can dispense small amounts of heroin to patients if they haven't been successful with methadone programs. The main barrier to implementing this program everywhere is really nothing but mindset. We'd have to stop considering addiction a moral failing, stop applying any kind of inherent morality to the drugs themselves, and start treating it like a health issue.\\nContinue Reading Below Advertisement\\nSo, uh, have fun with methadone forever, Americans.\",\n",

       " 'The Senate on Wednesday mandated its Committee on Health to investigate the circulation and sale in the country of 42 anti-malaria drugs banned by the European Union (EU).It said that the investigation was imperative and urged the committee to expedite action on it to save the lives of Nigerians.The decision followed a motion by Sen. Theodore Orji (PDP-Abia) at plenary on Wednesday.Presenting the motion, Orji said that the drugs, which were already banned by the EU, were still being sold and consumed in Nigeria.According to him, the reason given for the ban of the 42 drugs in Europe is that they are considered dangerous and linked to cause of kidney failure.He said that according to a report, EU countries must not stock drugs that contain Plasmotrin, Artequin, Co-arinate, Arco, Artecon and Dialquin.Orji disclosed that the President of the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA), Prof. Mike Ogirima, had already confirmed the delisting of those drugs by the EU.“It is alarming that the 42 drugs are still being stock-piled, sold and consumed in Nigeria.“This situation is already trending and generating panic and concern among medical practitioners and members of the public.“The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) and Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON) that had waged ceaseless war on the influx of fake and substandard items have not adequately addressed the issue,’’ he said.The lawmaker said that most of the drugs in the banned list were popular and common in Nigeria and were easily obtained across the counter with or without proper prescription.In his contribution, the Chairman, Senate Committee on Health, Sen. Olarewanju Tejuoso, commended the lawmaker for coming up with the motion.He said that the committee had invited the Acting Director-General of NAFDAC, Mrs Yetunde Oni, on the matter.However, he explained that from his experience as a medical doctor, some of the drugs were used as combination therapy.“There is a conflict between World Health Organisation (WHO) and European Union. The WHO for instance, accepts combination therapy.“The most important thing, however, is the need to strengthen the Medical Research Institute through adequate funding to carry out research on what works for us.“Every year, we rely on WHO and other organisations to find solution to our problems; so, the institute should be funded to know what works for us,’’ he said.Sen. Jibrin Barau (APC-Kano) said it was pathetic that such drugs still found their way into the country in spite of their adverse effect.He said, “no wonder we have rampant kidney failure in Nigeria. Unfortunately the experts are not doing their work properly.“It is important that agencies like NAFDAC and experts in health sector are called upon to quickly intervene.’’Sen. James Manager (PDP-Delta) said that the information given by Orji called for urgent attention, adding that if the drugs were dangerous for use in Europe, they would be dangerous to all humans.According to him, the difference between the Europeans and Africans is only the skin colour, all human organs function the same way.“Everyday people die silently because of wrong prescription of drugs.“We need to fund the institute if not we are indirectly poisoning Nigerians. So, the proper investigation should be done to give us the details in order to appropriately guide Nigerians.In his remarks, the President of the Senate, Dr Bukola Saraki, urged the committee to expedite action on the matter and report back as soon as possible.He commended Orji for coming up with the motion, adding that the protection of lives was one of the primary responsibilities of the legislature.“I hope the committee on health will carry out proper investigation to stop these types of drugs from flooding the market,’’ Saraki said.The list of the drugs as contained in the motion are Alaxin 60 mg tablet (dihydroartemisinine) B/8, Alaxin oral suspension (dihydroartemisinine) FL/80ml, Amadiaguine 200mg compressed B/1000, Arinate 100mgtablet(artesunate)B/6.Others are Arinate 50mg tablet (artesunate) B/6, Arsumax50 mg tablet (artesunate) B/6, Artemax 60 mg tablet (dihydroartemisinine) B/8, Artemedine 40 mg capsule (artemether) B/12, Artemedine 50 mg tablet (artemether) B/12.Also listed are Artenam 50 mg tablet(artemether)B/14, Artenam 60 mg tablet(artemether)b/8, Artesiane 300 mg child powder oral suspension (artemether)FL 38g, Artesunate 100 mg compressed B/120, Artesunate 50 mg tablet B/120, Artexin 60 mg tablet(dihydroartemisinine) B/8.Camoquin 200 mg tablet(amodiaguine) B/9, Camoquin 200 mg tablet(amodiaguine) B/25 blisters, Camoquin 200 mg tablet(amodiaguine) B/55 blisters, Camoquin 200 mg tablet(amodiaguine) B/24 blisters, Camoquin 600 mg tablet(amodiaguine) B/3 blisters, are also part of the list.They are also Camoquin oral suspension 50 mg/5ml (amodiaguine)FL/60ml, Cotecxin oral suspension(dihydroartemisinine)FL/80ml, Cotecxin 60 mg tablet(dihydroartemisinine)B/8, Daraprim tablet(pyrimethamine)B/8.Falcinil 50 mg tablet(artesunate)B/12, Flavoquine oral suspension50 mg/5ml(amodiaquine)FL/90ml, Flavoquine200 mg tablet(amodiaquine)B/16, Flavoquine 200 mg tablet(amodiaquine)B/240, made the list.Others are Gunate strong tablet(artesunate)B/6 gvs labs, Tvitter powder oral suspension(artemether)FL/100ml, Halfan 250mg tablet(halofantrine)B/6, Halfan 250mg tablet(halofantrine)B/120.The listed also contained Halfanoral suspension 5mg/5ml(halofantrine)FL/45ml, Malartin 200mg tablet(artesunate) B/6, Malartin 50mg tablet(artesunate) B/12, mmh-malarex 450mg capsule(peschiara fuchsiaefolia) B/20.It included Paludrine 100mg tablet(proguanil)B/56, Plasmotrim 200mg tablet(artesunate)B/25blisters/6, Plasmotrim 200mg tablet(artesunate)B/6, Plasmotrim 50mg lactab (artesunate)B/12, Plasmotrim 50mg lactab (artesunate)B/25 blisters/6.',\n",

       " 'The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has called on the Nigerian government to arrest the increasingly widespread use of pharmaceutical drugs among the country\\'s youths. The call was made in a memorandum sent to the National Assembly. Dated 26 March. The memo said available evidence shows that Tramadol and Codeine are the most abused pharmaceutical substances.\\nAccording to the UNODC, reported cases and anecdotal evidence indicate a steady rise in the non-medical use of pharmaceutical preparations among Nigerian youths. The full range of the problem is not yet known because there is yet no statistical data on the trend.\\nThe UNODC disclosed that along with the Federal Ministry of Health and other national partners it conducted a National Drug Use Survey between 2016 and 2017 to establish by evidence what the actual situation of drug use in the country is. The report of the survey, funded by the European Union (EU), will be released before the end of this year.\\n\"The result of the National Drug Use Survey will assist policymakers in identifying which drugs are used, the geography of use and the prevalence of drug use. With this evidence, policymakers will be better able to make informed and targeted interventions to address issues identified by the study,\" said the UNODC.\\nIt explained that reports from drug regulatory agencies and media indicate that Codeine and Tramadol are the most abused substances. Quoting the Nigerian Epidemiological Network on Drug Use (NENDU) of the patients who entered treatment for opioid use, UNODC said 69% were using Tramadol and 21% were using Codeine.\\n\"These drugs are reported to be abused for their narcotic effects and among the so-called \\'legal highs\\', as they are still legally authorized for the medical use in Nigeria. These two drugs are also not under the international control, which is monitored by the International Narcotics Control Board,\" said UNODC.\\nIt added that this is supported by evidence of significant seizures of Tramadol at seaports and warehouses by drug control agencies as well as by similar agencies in Ghana and Niger.\\nIt noted the the Nigerian government has expressed concerns over the abuse of codeine and tramadol, including at the Senate Roundtable on Drug Abuse in December 2017, in Kano.\\nThe UNODC, however, advised the Nigerian government that despite concerns about abuse, it should consider medical needs like clinical pain treatment requirements of Nigerians. These, explained the UNODC, include cancer-related pains and non-cancer related pains such as osteoarthritis, chronic back pain, neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia.\\nAccording to available data, added UNODC, there is an undersupply of pain medication to the country.\\n\"Therefore, there is a need to strike a balance between government policy providing for adequate access to pain medication and stricter controls of pain medication including codeine and Tramadol,\" advised the UNODC.\\nIt urged the Nigerian government to carry out a cost-benefit analysis before stiffening controls on licit pain medications being diverted and used for non-medical purposes. Such an analysis, it explained, must consider persons requiring access to pain medication, availability of alternative pain medication of the same classification, cost of the available alternative pain medication and the possibility of misuse the available alternative.\\nIn addition, the analysis should consider the potential of creating underground markets if legitimate access to pain medication is denied and the related organized crime that may result to feed such underground markets; scientific quantification and estimates of the pain medication requirements of the country; adequacy of the current regulations for the monitoring and control of the distribution of pain medication; as well as adequacy of the resourcing and funding of regulatory agencies to carry out routine and non-routine inspection and monitoring of legitimate distribution chains and outlets of pain medication.\\nUNODC stated that the country already a robust legal framework for the control of pharmaceutical narcotic drugs through the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control Act, which created the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) and defines its mandates.\\nThe mandates include to “undertake measures to ensure the use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances are limited to medical and scientific purposes” and “collaborate with the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency in measures to eradicate drug abuse in Nigeria”, provisions that empower NAFDAC to ensure the use of pharmaceutical narcotics solely for medical purposes.\\nThe UNODC also noted that the Counterfeit and Fake Drugs and Unwholesome Processed Foods (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act provides for the prohibition of the display and sale of drugs in unlicensed places, establishment of a Federal Task Force, chaired by NAFDAC, to coordinate the activities of State Task Forces in implementing its provisions and establishment of State Task Forces to among other things inspect premises where drugs are sold, inspect registers for the purposes of monitoring legitimate distributions of drugs and minimizing diversion of drugs.\\nThe Act equally provides for the establishment of a specialized Police Force Squad to assist the Federal Task Force in the enforcement of its provisions.\\n\"These provisions clearly set out the required legislative and institutional frameworks to address the challenges of the diversion of pharmaceutical narcotics to non-medical uses. The only challenge seems to be in the implementation of these provisions,\" said UNODC.\\nAs part of its recommendations, the UNODC said the Nigerian government should gather data on drug-use disorders\\' prevalence and the accessibility and utilization of treatment; invest in ensuring treatment and rehabilitation are evidence-based; and allocate sufficient resources to treatment and rehabilitation, the two crucial components of demand reduction.\\nIt equally recommended that the government should pay particular attention to special population groups, share nationally and internationally best practices and build capacity as well as stimulate research into new interventions.\\nThe UNODC also recommended that the Nigerian government should use the results of the National Drug Use Survey when released, as evidence to drive its policymaking; make available adequate resources to the drug regulatory authorities, provide adequate legislative oversight over drug regulatory authorities and encourage the drug regulatory authorities to make regulations requiring all manufacturers and marketers of pharmaceutical narcotics to print labels warning users of the addictive nature and other medical side effects of the drugs.\\n\"These messages should be field- tested to ensure that they effectively communicate the required message,\" said UNODC.\\nIt equally recommended that the Nigerian government should promote a nationwide campaign to sensitize the general public and vulnerable segment to the effect of non-medical use of pharmaceutical narcotics, including the possible inclusion of this in school health science curricula.\\nIt suggested that the sensitization messages must be developed using tested messages specifically targeted at parents, teachers and healthcare professionals who serve as role models.\\n\\u200b',\n",
       " \"From CEPR\\nI was glad to see Paul's short post explaining some of the economics of the US government negotiating drug prices with the drug companies: the route Donald Trump rejected. I thought I would add a few more points.\\nFirst, the monopoly profits earned by the drug companies provide a powerful incentive for rent-seeking. This is the standard story that economists always complain about with trade protection, except instead of talking about a tariff that raises the price of the protected item by 10 or 25 percent above the free market price, we're talking about a government-granted monopoly that typically raises the price of a factor of 10 or even 100 compared with the free market price. These markups are equivalent to tariffs of 1,000 percent or 10,000 percent.\\nThis not only encourages behavior like the payoff from Novartis to Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, it also gives drug companies an enormous incentive to misrepresent the safety and effectiveness of their drugs. We frequently hear stories of drug companies withholding evidence that their drugs are less effective than claimed or even harmful for some patients. Perhaps the most famous was the case where Merck allegedly withheld evidence that its arthritis drug, Vioxx, increases the risk of heart attack and strokes for people with heart disease. Needless to say, the costs from this sort behavior are enormous.\\nA second point is that we are not talking about a typical consumer buying decision, like buying a car or a cell phone. People buy drugs because they are in bad health and possibly facing death. As Krugman notes, there is typically a third-party payer, either an insurer or the government. Apart from the possibility that this can lead to excessive payments that Krugman discusses, there is also the perverse dynamics this creates.\\nThe price that companies end up getting for their drugs, and if they get it all, depends on the ability of patients to lobby their insurer or the government. Naturally, the drug companies are happy to help in this effort. There is a whole set of industry-funded disease groups that are largely aimed at forcing insurers and the government to buy expensive drugs, often of questionable value, from the drug companies.\\nThis also raises the point that it is pretty crazy that we expect people when they are sick or dying to pay for research that has already been done. In almost all cases, the cost of manufacturing and delivering drugs is cheap, we make it expensive with government-granted patent monopolies. If we asked questions about paying for possibly life-saving drugs at their actual production costs, it would almost always be a no-brainer. But when we have a cancer drug, which may not even work, that a drug company sells for several hundred thousand dollars, it becomes a tough question as to whether the government should pick up the tab or force insurers to do so.\\nFinally, there is an absurd view in this debate that somehow patent monopolies are the only way to finance innovation. There is no argument that we have to pay for research; no one expects highly skilled researchers to work for free. But we can and do have other mechanisms for paying for this work.\\nThe government already spends more than $30 billion a year on biomedical research, primarily through the National Institutes of Health. This research is incredibly productive by all accounts. There is no reason, in principle, that we can't double or triple the amount we spend on directly supported research. This would allow all new drugs to be sold at generic prices, without patent monopolies or related protections. By my calculations, this would save close to $380 billion a year (around 2.0 percent of GDP or more than five times the annual budget for the food stamp program). We would also benefit from having all the research findings in the public domain so that doctors and other researchers would have access to it when making decisions for their patients or planning future research.\\nIf this funding route sounds bizarre, think of the military. While there is plenty of waste in the military, we actually do develop very effective weapons systems through direct government funding. (This is not an endorsement of their use.) Furthermore, drug development has a big advantage over the military in that it would all be fully public as a requirement for funding. There is a real rationale for secrecy with military research, even if it is often over-played. There is no excuse for secrecy in publicly funded drug research.\\nIt would be great if Trump's servile response to the industry on negotiations led to pressure not only for lower prices but modernizing the way in which we finance drug development. Patent monopolies might have been great for the feudal guild system, they are not a good way to finance biomedical research in the twenty-first century.\",\n",
       " 'Crime, it seems, has captured the imagination of youngsters big time, an indication of which was unearthed by city cops on social media recently.\\nCombing social media platforms, the police stumbled upon a few videos created using TikTok, a phenomenally successful micro-video sharing app, eulogizing some infamous goons in the city and the larger district swaggering along escorted by their minions. Incidentally, one of them was arrested following an order issued by the District Collector, invoking provisions of the Kerala Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, shortly after his video emerged.\\nAfter checking for the origin of the videos, the social media cell of the police concluded that that they were not posted by goons from their personal ids and, hence, it was not possible to ask TikTok administrators to remove them.\\n‘Hero worship’\\n“They were probably the handiwork of some impressionable youngsters who were in awe of the goons and worship them like heroes because of the aura they create by moving around with their gang members and seemingly live life king-size. These videos then probably got shared through WhatsApp and amounted to glorifying anti-social elements,” said an official associated with the social media wing of the police.\\nThe incident is in sync with the trend of increasing involvement of youngsters in crimes reported in the city and the district at large.\\n18-25 age group\\n“We have noticed the involvement of youngsters, especially those in the 18-25 age group, in cases predominantly related to drugs and assaults, which they commit in a state of high after using drugs. Pressure at workplace is now common, to escape from which many youngsters start using drugs and subsequently get caught in the vortex of crime,” said K. Laljy, Assistant Commissioner of Police (Ernakulam).\\nHowever, Naveen James, a 25-year-old lawyer, said there was also an element of toxic masculinity that came easy to youngsters, a section of whom found anarchy an ideal state and even wore criminal cases registered against them as a badge of honour.\\n“From my limited experience as a lawyer, I get the impression that such youngsters are more into drug peddling and theft and mostly stay away from serious cases. Quick money is a lure and I personally know guys from very good families volunteering for such illegal activities,” he said.\\nHowever, that is not always the case as the gruesome murder of a 19-year-old allegedly by his friends-turned-foes at Nettoor proved. “All the accused were youngsters and they did it a state of high under the influence of drugs,” said C. Vinod, Station House Officer, Maradu.\\n‘Quotation’ cases\\nAnd therein lies the biggest instigator behind a majority of crimes by youngsters — drugs. “Drug abuse has emerged a necessary evil or even a qualification in a society where there is demand for ‘quotation’ work, mostly involving youngsters, to settle personal, professional and business scores with rivals. For, no normal person can hack to death an absolute stranger purely for monetary gains, and the mind numbing drugs come in handy then. That is why there is almost a direct proportion between the usage of drugs and crimes among youngsters,” said A.S. Ranjith, Deputy Excise Commissioner, Ernakulam.\\nFor a glittering life\\nArjun Balachandran, a 25-year-old business consultant with a global corporate firm, cited “peer pressure” as a main reason for youngsters gravitating towards the world of crime. There may be one rotten apple in a group and that person’s bad influence could lead peers down the path of doom.\\n“As fancy lifestyles are increasingly becoming the norm, the new generation goes in pursuit of that glittering life, making them vulnerable to all the accompanying pitfalls. Greater access to films and web series, many of which are way too violent, across various live-streaming platforms, may also be a bad influence on an already vulnerable youth,” he said.\\nHarnessing energy\\nAjithkumar Thampan, noted criminologist and former chief investigator with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, London, said youngsters alone could not be blamed for their mess and pointed towards the all-pervading loss of hope and social disintegration, making them more individualistic. “No one is born a criminal but society turns them into one. But all is not lost with these youngsters as they proved with their exemplary volunteer work during last year’s floods. Unfortunately, there is no system to harness it, correct them and lead them towards a meaningful life,” he said.\\nIt is not that youngsters suddenly turn criminals on entering adulthood. Going by increasing incidents of children in conflict with law, the seeds of a problematic future seem to be getting planted quite early in their lives. The villain — drugs — crops up here as well.\\nBiji George, Assistant Commissioner of Police and the district nodal officer for juvenile-related incidents, recollected an incident in which the police happened to trace a Class 3 student who was into drugs.\\n“In the last three years, incidents involving juveniles have spiked and drugs was the inducer in a majority of cases. The inherent curiosity of their age means that they are lured into experimenting with drugs out of peer pressure and a large section among them turns habitual users. As they progress into pedlars in the next stage, mobility becomes a problem and they find an easy solution by stealing two-wheelers. This is the overwhelming pattern we have noticed in these cases,” he said.\\nK.B. Zaina, district Child Protection Officer, cited the proliferation of drugs near school campuses as the biggest contributing factor, luring children into the menace.\\n“More than 90% of cases that come up before the Juvenile Justice Board have drugs as the triggering factor. Unless society collectively wakes up to this danger, the situation will only get progressively worse,” she said.\\nMaterialistic life\\nNoted psychiatrist C.J. John goes one step further and warns that unless properly dealt with, violence and crimes involving youth could emerge as one of the most challenging mental health problems in another five years.\\nHe pointed out that there were many aspects to the problem, one of which was the lack of life skills of youngsters, leaving them with abysmally low levels of tolerance in dealing with frustration and stress.\\n“Life has also turned increasingly materialistic and, for an average youth, the yardstick for measuring his life is how much he is able to enjoy it. This is intrinsically linked to money and earning it by any means become acceptable. Incidents such as murder of a lover should not be seen in isolation, but as different facets of a larger problem. That will help us realise the magnitude of the challenge we are staring at,” said Dr. John.',\n",

       " 'A group comprising every former Drugs Minister in the State has called for urgent action on the drugs crisis in Ireland, citing the situation as being “at epidemic proportions”.\\nThe grouping representing nine former office holders met in Dublin to promote their joint statement calling for the Government to “restore confidence” in the National Drugs Strategy, which has been in place in varying formats since 1996, in order to avert its collapse.\\nThe goal for the statement was twofold - to convince the Taoiseach to appoint one of his own senior officials to the National Oversight Committee of the national strategy, and for funding for the 20 drugs and alcohol task forces spread around the country to be restored to their pre-recession levels.\\nThe national budget for those task forces has been static at €28m since 2015, despite the evolution of the drugs problem nationwide and a ballooning health budget overall. One worker on the ground, Tim Murphy from the Cavan Monaghan Drug Alcohol Service, said his own project is set to shut by end 2020 due to lack of resources.\\n“We may be the first but we won’t be the last,” he said.\\n“The strategy, if you read it, it doesn’t seem to apply to the Ireland I know. Its mandate is not being delivered upon, and I don’t think the Government is cognisant of the impact of that failure on criminal justice in the country.”\\nLabour Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin described the coming together of ministers from three separate political parties as being an “unprecedented” event, one necessitated by the “life or death issue” facing the Irish State.\\n“We have the third-highest overdose rate in the EU,” he said.\\n“What is clear is that the people who are dying are not important enough to this Government.”\\nThose sentiments were the most heavily politicised expressed on the day. The other former ministers present shied away from such criticism, particularly of current Drugs Minister Catherine Byrne, preferring to focus on the structural problem facing the National Drug Strategy, the most recent update of which was released two years ago.\\nCommon to all present was the criticism laid at the door of the Department of Health and the HSE - that rather than a partnership approach between affected communities and the State, the strategy has become subsumed into a HSE-led project.\\nCoordinator of drugs crisis campaign Citywide - which organised the event at Buswell’s Hotel next to Dáil Éireann - Anna Quigley, said that the joint statement by the nine former ministers had already had one tangible effect: “We got a response from the Department, something which is very hard to do”.\\nYesterday Minister Byrne declared herself “committed to implementing an integrated public health response to substance misuse”.\\n“Working in partnership with statutory, community and voluntary sectors is central to this response,” she said.\\nRóisín Shortall, the former minister and current Social Democrats TD, told the gathering that securing representation from Leo Varadkar on the oversight committee would be key to bringing the drugs strategy back from the brink. “If it matters to the Taoiseach then it will matter to everyone else,” she said. “This isn’t being driven at a senior level and it has to be.”\\nPat Carey, the former Fianna Fáil minister, said: “Catherine Byrne is working tremendously hard but she doesn’t have enough money. Something has to be done because the issue is at epidemic proportions across the country at this stage.\"',\n",

Forgive us for buying on the street”, Riva Massa said.\\nBut not everyone falls for this. Others are well aware of the dangerous practice.\\n“I like to go to the drugstore because the products on the street don’t work too well. Everything is exposed to the sun. I don’t really like to take this. It’s not good to sell the drugs on the street. In pharmacies they are rather well preserved. To keep my life, my health, I prefer to buy them in pharmacies”, fake drugs patron, Dany Massamba said.\\nAt a recently held training program for health sector workers in Brazzaville, experts recommended the population to purchase drugs from certified pharmacists.\\nDr. Edrène Mampouyath is an official with the Congolese health ministry.\\n“When you think about that, you realize that you can’t really fight fake drugs if the ‘‘pharmaco-vigilance’‘ system is not well executed.

       " 'The former lord chancellor Charles Falconer has apologised for his role in the war on drugs, as a group of leading politicians from across the world called for the legalisation and regulation of the drugs trade.\\nIn an open letter, Lord Falconer, who served in a number of other cabinet roles under Tony Blair, said he now realised drug prohibition had been a “tragic disaster” for the poor in Britain and across the world.\\nHe challenged Jeremy Corbyn – “a radical Labour leader” – to commit to the legal regulation of drug production and supply in the next Labour manifesto.\\n“I am sorry for supporting the war on drugs,” Falconer said in his letter, published on the UnHerd website.\\n“We need to accept there are alternatives to policies that have failed so many working class communities. We need to admit that we abandoned whole generations to the scourge of drug addiction. We need to confront our political failures and listen to those police chiefs pushing for saner policies.\\n“Above all, we need to take back control of drug supply from the most violent gangsters. And it needs to be done sooner rather than later.”\\nFalconer’s admission came as a group of former national leaders called for the legalisation of illicit drugs. The Global Commission on Drug Policy said such a move would disempower organised crime, and would help realise the goal of drug control conventions to protect “the health and welfare of mankind”.\\nIn a report published in Mexico on Monday afternoon, the commission, which includes nine former presidents, three former prime ministers and the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, said regulation would shift control of drugs from black markets to “appropriate government agencies”.\\n“To regulate drugs is to apply the regulatory principles and tools that are routinely applied to everything else to a set of risky products and behaviours that have, until now, been controlled entirely within a criminal economy,” said the report, which was the last piece of work by the late former UN secretary general Kofi Annan.\\nRisks posed from drugs increased when they were sourced from unregulated criminal producers, it said, because of a lack of quality controls. Legalising and regulating drugs, the report argued, could reverse the “iron law of prohibition”, whereby the harder a ban was enforced, the stronger forms the banned substances take as a result of a need to avoid detection.',\n",

       " 'Health workers also explained that they are under intense pressure from clinic owners to meet certain revenue targets.\\nHealth & Science\\n“Sometimes clinics want to offload near-expiry drugs\"\\nMany patients are being prescribed excessive medicines as hospitals offload near-expiry stocks.A recent survey among 21,913 patients in Nairobi recorded huge over-prescriptions especially of antibiotics - well over and above recommended levels. One of the reasons for the over-prescription, the report says was for health facilities to offload near-expiry medicines and improve on revenues. “When it comes to private clinics, you also have other goals . . . you have target revenues,” said a medical doctor. Researchers analysed mobile phone data in the donor supported M-TIBA programme where majority of hospital visits were due to respiratory tract infections.\\nSEE ALSO: Where is the Sh12m? Shame of frontline medics not yet housed\\nThese infections included common cold, bronchitis, tonsillitis and other conditions some not normally recommended for antibiotics.\\nHigh degrees\\nPlos One\\nHowever, the study published recently in the journalshows antibiotics prescriptions rates for respiratory infections going up to 99.8 per cent. “These high degrees of prescription surpass levels recommended by national and international standard treatment guidelines,” says the study by Dutch researchers and the Gertrude’s Children’s Hospital, Nairobi. The eight-month study, analysed 36,210 visits at four clinics in Nairobi involving 21,913 patients with 85,484 prescriptions. It indicates only a few of the treatments were supported by comprehensive laboratory tests. Official treatment guidelines recommend no antibiotics for infections such as common cold and bronchitis, a major cause of hospital visits in Kenya. In this study, the antibiotic amoxicillin constituted nearly one-third 7,061 or 32.3 per cent of total antibiotic drug prescriptions.\\nSEE ALSO: Health workers will now receive allowances\\nIn August, the World Health Organisation, warned of fake Augmentin (usually a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid) pills circulating in Kenya. “Money first. Guys go straight to the more expensive Amoxil-Clavulanic combination . . . they tend to think about money first,” said a doctor in the current study. Health workers also explained that they are under intense pressure from clinic owners to meet certain revenue targets. “You are not going to prescribe drugs worth Sh100 and yet you have the original drug worth Sh3,000. So, you will tend to move towards the more expensive drugs, and keep away from the cheap drugs that are supposed to be used at first,” said another medical doctor. In February 2019, the annual conference of the Kenya Medical Research Institute was told of widespread sale of substandard amoxicillin in many retail pharmacies in Nairobi. The researchers reported purchasing samples from retail pharmacies in seven wards in Nairobi - the CBD, Karen, South C, South B, Zimmerman, Kayole and Kibra.\\nSEE ALSO: Healthworkers to get allowances\\nAfter laboratory analysis, 46 per cent of the samples were confirmed to be of poor quality. In the current study, however, the researchers asked patients’ and healthcare providers the cause of excessive drug prescriptions. “Sometimes clinics want to offload near-expiry drugs,” said a clinical officer. Some distributors give doctors or clinics huge discounts on near-expiring drugs for the quick offload on patients. The Kenya Health System Assessment report published in June 2019 by the Ministry of Health and USAID said Kenya has the fourth highest Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) reporting rate in Africa.\\nOver-prescription\\nOther reasons for over-prescription in the current study was due to high patient load, clinician and patient perceptions that clinicians should prescribe, lack of access to laboratory tests and the use of obsolete treatment guidelines.\\nSEE ALSO: Health workers extend strike notice to Monday\\nThe health workers were especially worried over an increasing number of ‘Google-patients’ in Kenya. “These are patients who already have the symptoms; they turn to Google, then come to you in a panic, and get annoyed when you do not give them antibiotics,” said a doctor.',\n",
       " '\"Pinjar banate kitte put maawan de, agg diye bhathiye\\nKineyan di zindagi black karti, ni tu laal battiye,\"\\n\\'Laal Batti\\', a contemporary popular Punjabi song that laments the loss of a generation to smack addiction\\nMuch has been said and written about the Punjab drugs epidemic, both in India and abroad for the past several years. The focus on drug use in the state reemerged after Rahul Gandhi quoted a study from Guru Nanak University claiming that 70 percent of all youth in Punjab were addicted to drugs. In 2013, the state had the highest number of cases (42.2 percent) registered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act in India, and in 2014, Punjab reported the highest number of convicts (3,972 out of a national total of 8,923) under the NDPS Act.\\nAddiction in the state is attributed to a complex network of factors, including its proximity to the India-Pakistan border, its vulnerability to the Golden Crescent, political apathy, disguised unemployment due to mechanised farming, and an influx of migrants, amongst others. Drug trafficking and peddling serve as sources of easy money; transporting half a kilo of heroin purportedly fetches anything between Rupees 50,000 to 1,00000. Officials admit that prison walls are porous too, with drug abuse in jails being particularly high.\\nOne village that crops up each time in this puzzling narrative is that of Maqboolpura. Frequently described as \\'the village of widows\\', Maqboolpura, on the outskirts of the city of Amritsar, is notorious because every family there is believed to have lost at least one male member to drug addiction. This is also symptomatic of the rest of Punjab, where the persons accused of, or directly affected by, drug use are usually men. Throughout this narrative, the women in Punjab are regarded almost always as \\'victims\\' of the drug trade, as widows or orphans, but not as drug users themselves.\\nWhere are the women in this narrative?\\nDespite the easy availability of drugs in Punjab, empirical data available on drug use seems to indicate that women appear to have resisted the urge to use drugs.\\nAccording to a study conducted by Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, for over 2,000 men imprisoned in the Amritsar Central jail in 2016 under the NDPS Act, only 40 women had been charged under the act. Of the 40 women, only 10 had been drug users. The rest were accused of peddling.\\nIn contrast, almost all the men jailed under the NDPS Act were accused of drug abuse. Of the 9,462 people enrolled with the Swami Vivekanand de-addiction Centre in Amritsar, only 33 were women. The data from the prisons and de-addiction centres also suggests that even if women are being used as drug mules or traffickers, few, if any, are falling prey to drug use.\\nSpeaking to Firstpost, Dr Sandeep Bhola of the Kapurthala Civil Hospital said that many male peddlers who fell prey to drug use, would enrol in the Kapurthala de-addiction centre voluntarily, and hand over the reins of their drug business to their wives for the period of their stay at the centre. But the fear that their wives would yield to drug use themselves never seemed to have crossed their minds.\\nWhy are women not being seen as drug users?\\nTo understand why there was a patent absence of women in drug use statistics in Punjab, we conducted a series of interviews with judges, policemen, prison officials, doctors and social workers. Our questions about this startling gap between the number of male and female substance abusers, despite the easy availability of drugs in the state, were met with much incredulity. Responses indicated that the very notion of women indulging in drug abuse was unimaginable. The social disapproval of women indulging in drug abuse (and alcohol) was considered sufficient cause to discourage women from consuming drugs.\\nA study conducted by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) acknowledges that female drug use is particularly hard to capture, as evidenced by their under-representation in traditional drug surveys as well as treatment facilities. The study suggests that certain identifiable factors contribute to a lower prevalence of female drug abuse. For example, women tend to prioritise their families’ needs over their own due to overwhelming family responsibilities, leaving drug dependence hidden and untreated. Societal disapproval, fear of exposure and lack of support further influence access to treatment, are other factors.\\nThe interviews we conducted suggest that the lack of drug use amongst women could also be attributed to issues of socialisation and access. Drug use tends to be driven by peer influence. However, in Punjab, particularly in rural areas, women usually do not step out of their homes, which reduces peer influence, and by extension, access to drugs. In contrast, where women engage more with people outside their immediate family, access to drugs is easier.\\nAnecdotally, many interviewees said that women who studied in universities or lived in hostels or big cities were more susceptible to drug use than those who lived on farms or in villages. Dr Bhola said that \"hidden\" drug use was prevalent among female college students, but obvious use was greatest among female prostitutes in Punjab. This was so for various reasons: relatively easier access; little or no stigma attached to use (at least, not more than the stigma prostitutes already had to face); and fewer, if any, male relatives to be answerable to. Most crucially, perhaps, these women viewed drugs as an escape route from their professional/ personal lives.\\nIt is also true that women entering the criminal justice system are as such far lower compared with men. As per data provided by the National Crime Records Bureau, women accounted for 5.1 percent of all cognizable crimes committed in 2016 across India. This feeds the general perception or belief that women are not likely to engage in criminalised activities like drug addiction or drug trafficking. As a result, they are not regarded as suspects, and are less prone to be questioned, detained or arrested in connection with cases involving drugs.\\nFrom the data and interviews, it is evident that drug abuse among women is met with intense social stigma. As the UNODC report suggests, female drug users are considered doubly deviant by society: people who use drugs are already considered deviant due to criminalisation, whereas women consuming drugs are seen to have further transgressed socially-accepted roles of wives, mothers and family nurturers.\\nPerhaps, it is true, as many speculate, that the combination of lack of opportunity and social reprisal has led to women desisting from drug use. But the opposite could be equally probable, that women are increasingly using drugs, but neither the criminal justice system nor the rehabilitation machinery captures them as users. The startlingly low number of women seeking de-addiction could be because women are reluctant to seek treatment, for fear of exposing themselves as drug users. If this is the case, continuing to resist from accepting women as drug users (thus denying them appropriate treatment) may have long-term effects on the health of society itself, and interventions that do not keep women’s realities in mind may fall short, if not fail altogether.\\nThe authors are senior resident fellows at the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy',\n",

       " 'The central and state anti-drug agencies must break the chain\\nBollywood actress Rhea Chakraborty has been arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in a drug case linked to her boyfriend and actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. The arrest followed three days of her intense questioning by the officials of the NCB. Rhea is the 10th person to be arrested in the case. The NCB is one of the three agencies that have been probing the death of Sushant who was found hanging at his Mumbai residence on June 14. She has been remanded to judicial custody till September 22 by the court after she was produced before it through video conferencing. The NCB alleged that she was an “active member” of a drug syndicate and procured drugs for the deceased Rajput. It has also been said that she was a key person in handling procurement of drugs for Sushant. She has been booked under various provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.\\nEven as the NCB started the probe into alleged drug nexus in the Sushant case, the involvement of some people from Goa and their links in the drug chain has recently surfaced. Some people allegedly linked to the drug trade were even called for a probe. However, it has to be noted that the focus of investigation in the case was Rhea and her brother who too has been arrested. Though neither has any direct evidence to link the Chakraborty family surfaced nor has any drug been found in their possession, the siblings have been arrested on having accepted their “guilt” in procuring drugs during their interrogation. It has also been claimed by the probing agency that the others who have been arrested have pointed fingers at the Chakraborty siblings in procurement of drugs. The NCB should take the case to its logical end by collecting enough evidence against all to ensure conviction of those involved in drug trafficking.\\nIt is well known that drug trafficking and consumption is widespread in the country. Two Kannada actors have recently been booked for various offences under NDPS Act. Goa too has seen big seizures of drugs over the last few years. The Kapil Jhaveri rave party case at Vagator is the latest one in Goa in which 23 people were arrested and drugs worth Rs 9 lakh were seized. Though the state government and police bosses have been claiming that they had zero tolerance to drugs, drug cases keep on surfacing, which suggests that while a few cases come out in the open, many others go on undetected. There have been some big seizures. Despite the fact that the drug trade was continuing, it remains a harsh reality that the NCB, whose officials are posted in Goa, and the state police have not been able to wipe it out. The NCB had recently unearthed a big racket and seized drugs worth lakhs of rupees in Mumbai and Delhi that were to be shipped to Goa from where they were to be transferred to Bengaluru.\\nIt has for long been alleged that the drug trade has been thriving in Goa with the active patronage of politicians and policemen. The fears expressed by people about political patronage to drug traffickers apparently is seen as coming true with not much headway being made by the police in the Vagator rave party case. Some others arrested in drug cases have been allowed to be released on bail after the police failed to complete the probe into the cases. There have also been allegations of poor investigation in some drug cases leading to the acquittal of those involved. There have been claims that the organizer of the Vagator rave party had strong political links. Since the name of Goa has figured again in the drug trade and that too at the national level, the state and central authorities should direct the NCB to take on the probe and ensure that it goes to the bottom to unearth the nexus and break the chain in the drug trade. It is time for the state and central agencies to show the same zeal against drug trade as has been seen in the Sushant case to free the Goan tourism and Goan society from the curse of drugs.',\n",

       " 'NAFDAC is ill-equipped to fight the drug war\\nThe recent unpleasant experience of the enforcement team of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) in Onitsha, Anambra State, calls for investigation. Aided by Plumbing Material Market Association (PMMA) officials, the suspected counterfeiters at the market pelted NAFDAC officials with stones thus preventing them from carrying out their mandate to rid the country of unwholesome drugs and products. That has given the counterfeiters and their enablers at the market the latitude to quickly relocate the unwholesome and substandard products to new locations which will take another ample time of intelligence gathering to track.\\nTill date, there is no known report to show that the attitude of the counterfeiters and their enablers in the unfortunate display in Onitsha has been dealt with. The violent attackers at the market walked free while the institution enabled to tackle them left the market for fear of being harmed. Worse still, there are hundreds of such places across the country where substandard and counterfeited drugs and products are diverted, concealed and stored for subsequent distribution to unsuspecting Nigerians who continue to bear the brunt of this unwholesome practice.\\nThe growing concern is whether the enforcement team of NAFDAC is being given the needed support by security agencies, considering their unique and important regulatory task in the country. Just last year, the Director General of NAFDAC, Prof. Mojisola C. Adeyeye vented her frustration when she said the enforcement team of the agency was lacking a number of things including operational vehicles. The agency at the time requested for 50 operational vehicles, yet none was released.\\nIt is obvious that the federal government has in recent years failed to appreciate the importance of NAFDAC to the health of the country. In 2017, the agency had a proposal of N6.1 billion as its annual budget, but the National Assembly approved a paltry N164 million. To make matters worse, the federal government ended up releasing N82 million for the whole year. In 2018, the agency had a proposal of N8.4 billion of which N229 million was appropriated and only N22.9million was released.\\nComparing the operations of NAFDAC with those of other countries will perhaps bring home the point that NAFDAC is grossly under supported to rid the country of fake, counterfeit and substandard drugs and products. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) – an equivalent of NAFDAC in Nigeria – spent $5.1 billion in 2018 for purchase, maintenance of equipment and the general running of the federal parastatal. That is the equivalent of Nigeria’s entire health sector budget for five years combined. Comparatively, NAFDAC in 2018 spent N22.9 million, about $63,000 while FDA in the same year spent $5.1 billion on same job description.\\nThere is no doubt that the present director general, Prof Adeyeye is moving against the tide in the bid to fight counterfeiters. With minimal institutional support, there is little that can be done. Ordinarily, every hot spot for concealing and storing counterfeit drugs from Lagos, to Onitsha, up to Kano and Edo state should be visited and perpetrators brought to book. But does NAFDAC have the capacity to rid these places of counterfeit drugs the way it would have wanted to? The answer of course is No as the agency is practically becoming moribund to the delight of counterfeiters.\\nIt is therefore time the federal government gave priority to fighting counterfeit, fake and unwholesome drugs and products in the country.',\n",

       " 'By MetroNews Staff in News | March 27, 2017 at 12:02AM\\nCHARLESTON, W.Va. — A new report which found numerous overdoses in the state’s regional jail and corrections facilities is prompting action. Military Affairs and Public Safety Secretary Jeff Sandy, in the wake of the report, ordered immediate action to halt any and all drug activity behind bars in the state.\\nCarrying out the order has required some creative thinking. Deputy Corrections Commissioner Mike Coleman said the first order was to all wardens and security personnel to tighten up on the basics of corrections security. Each inmate is undergoing a more thorough search each time they move within the facility, especially those who are out of the jail or prison environment for a period of time for work release or similar reasons and return.\\nThose measures are limited in their impact, the bigger task is overcoming the creative thinking of inmates and outsiders who have found a lucrative profit smuggling drugs into the prisons. Coleman said the northern West Virginia drug task force recently broke up a drug ring which was buying the chemical components of “liquid K-2” from China, spraying it onto paper, and then mailing the drugs into the lockup.\\n“They made over $250,000 smuggling that paper they coat with the substances into regional jails, prisons, and even federal prisons here in West Virginia,” said Coleman on MetroNews Talkline. “So there’s a huge return on investment and a financial incentive involved to get people into that kind of drug trafficking.”\\nPrison officials discovered mail coming into the prisons and regional jails was coated with the drugs and disguised as innocent material with letters and even children’s’ drawings or pictures.\\n“We received last year 300,000 pieces of mail in the Regional Jail System. Yes, some of it was getting through,” said David Farmer Executive Director of the Regional Jail Authority. “But, we took the initiative to put in a new policy starting March 6 that we now photocopy all mail.”\\nThe change cut down on the import of the coated pages, but Farmer and Coleman both admit the inmates are always thinking of something else.\\n“They’re very creative,” said Farmer. “We’re going to continue to fight to keep drugs from coming in. This is just phase one.”\\n“What the inmates call ‘suitcasing’ where they secrete it in body cavities,” said Coleman. “They also do drive-by drops and drive-by throw overs.”\\nBoth men acknowledge limiting the drug smuggling is only half the problem, the other half of the equation is killing the demand and that requires drug treatment and rehabilitation.\\n“Forty-three percent of our intakes had to be on some sort of protocol,” Farmer said. “That’s driven up our medical costs over 43 percent in the last three years.”\\nThe problem led to a partnership by the Division of Corrections and the Regional Jail Authority to create the first ever in-jail treatment center in West Virginia. A section of the Southwestern Regional Jail in Logan County is designated as a treatment facility with an area for male and female inmates to detox and get treatment for addiction.\\nBoth Farmer and Coleman believe these are the first steps toward getting the epidemic which permeates the walls of the jails and prisons under control.',\n",

       " 'By FARRAH JOHNSON\\nTribune Staff Reporter\\nfjohnson@tribunemedia.net\\nA 23-year-old man who attempted to flush 10 grams of marijuana down the toilet when officers raided his home was ordered to attend drug counselling classes for a year.\\nRasheed Seymour appeared before Deputy Chief Magistrate Andrew Forbes charged with one count of simple possession, after officers found $30 worth of Indian hemp in his home on January 11.\\nThe court was told that officers went to Seymour’s residence around 4 o’clock that morning. On their arrival, they showed the occupants of the home a warrant and informed them of their search. During their investigation, officers discovered marijuana residue in the toilet bowl and on the window sill in one of the bathrooms of the home. Seymour was subsequently arrested and taken to the Drug Enforcement Unit. In an interview with police there, he said he had bought the drugs for his personal use.\\nDuring the hearing, the accused pleaded guilty. As a result, he was conditionally discharged for 12 months on the condition that he would attend drug counseling classes at the Department of Social Services. Magistrate Forbes warned the accused that if he failed to comply with the conditions of his release, he would be sentenced to three months behind bars.',\n",
       " 'A 16-YEAR-OLD Londoner was found with thousands of pounds worth of hard drugs in a Swindon terrace, a court heard.\\nSolomon Adewunmi, now 19, denies conspiracy to supply heroin and crack cocaine in Swindon in December 2017 and January 2018. He also faces an allegation of possession of criminally-acquired cash.\\nJurors at Swindon Crown Court were yesterday told that Adewunmi did not deny being involved in the County Lines operation known by the line’s brand name “Frank”.\\nBut the teenager was expected to tell the jury he had been acting under duress – a legal defence.\\nOpening the case yesterday afternoon, prosecutor David Scutt claimed the evidence did not to support the suggestion Adewunmi was in fear for his safety.\\n“The Crown’s case is he was trusted to [sell drugs] despite his age; he was 16 at the time. But it’s not a job you just give to someone who’s only doing it through force,” Mr Scutt said.\\n“He was alone. No one else was seen coming and going from the property. No one else was in the flat. Think about it in terms of the defendant’s defence, look ahead. ‘I was forced to do it. I didn’t want to be there, it was the last thing I wanted to be doing.’\\n“What was to prevent him running away or going to the police if he was truly under duress? What was to prevent him? He will, obviously, say, ‘well, this very nasty person, these very nasty people they were the ones who prevented me because they just had me in their grip, in their power’.\\n“There was no one at the scene, no one – as far as we can see – in Swindon.\\n“Messaging to and fro from the defendant to whomever [the person putting him under duress] or from whomever to the defendant, there is not a scintilla of evidence of threat coming in or fear or concern going out. Not a bat’s squeak.\\n“It’s the easiest thing to say when you’re caught red-handed ‘they made me do it’. It’s just so simple. But, as you will hear, as we have heard, he didn’t say it at the time of the arrest.” He did not tell the detectives who interviewed him or took him home to Hackney later that day that he was being forced to sell drugs.\\nThe court heard drugs squad officers had been patrolling Swindon town centre in unmarked cars on January 8, 2018. They spotted a group of drug addicts behind the Rolleston Arms, Commercial Road.\\nA woman who lived on nearby Curtis Street Tiffany Ellis, was suspected of dealing drugs to the group. She was arrested in the alley in possession of a drug wrap and cash.\\nOfficers let themselves into her home and found Adewunmi in the kitchen, jurors heard. He was said to have pushed one of the constables in the chest in a bid to get away. He was cuffed only after one of the officers fired a Taser at him.\\nInside the house, officers found an estimated £7,000 worth of crack cocaine and heroin, £415 in a case and a machete in an upstairs bedroom. A toddler was found in the bath.\\nAdewunmi, who had an expensive Tommy Hilfiger jacket, was found with two phones: an iPhone and cheap Nokia burner phone. Analysis showed both had been in contact with the telephone numbers used by the “Frank” County Line. Jurors were shown pictures of cash discovered on one phone and a thread of messages between Adewunmi’s phone and another named only as Scramz86. In one of those messages, Adewunmi said “man’s in O”. A Metropolitan Police drugs expert told the jury “O” was a slang term for “out country”, typically referring to being away from London selling drugs.\\nAdewunmi, of Pamela Street, Hackney, denies conspiracy to supply class A drugs and possession of criminal property.\\nThe trial continues.',\n",

       " 'Advertising Read more\\nTokyo (AFP)\\nJapanese researchers have genetically engineered hens whose eggs contain drugs that can fight serious diseases including cancer, in a bid to dramatically reduce the cost of treatment, a report said Monday.\\nIf the scientists are able to safely produce \"interferon beta\", a type of protein used to treat illnesses including multiple sclerosis and hepatitis, by rearing the hens, the price of the drug -- currently up to 100,000 yen ($888) for a few microgrammes -- could fall significantly, said the English edition of the Yomiuri Shimbun.\\nResearchers at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) in the Kansai region kicked off the process by introducing genes that produce interferon beta into cells which are precursors of chicken sperm, the newspaper reported.\\nThey then used these cells to fertilise eggs and create hens which inherited those genes, meaning the birds were able to lay eggs containing the disease-fighting agent.\\nThe scientists now have three hens whose eggs contain the drug, with the birds laying eggs almost daily, the report said.\\nThe researchers plan to sell the drug to pharmaceutical companies, halving its price, so the firms can use it first as a research material, the newspaper said.\\nConsumers may have to wait a while, as Japan has strict regulations concerning the introduction of new or foreign pharmaceutical products, with screening processes that routinely take years to complete.\\nBut the team hopes that the technological breakthrough will eventually help drive down the cost of the drug to 10 percent of its current price, the newspaper reported.\\nOfficials at the institute could not be reached for comment.\\n© 2017 AFP',\n",
       " 'AI invents new ‘recipes’ for potential COVID-19 drugs\\nScience ’s COVID-19 reporting is supported by the Pulitzer Center and the Heising-Simons Foundation.\\nAs scientists uncover drugs that can treat coronavirus infections, demand will almost certainly outstrip supplies—as is already happening with the antiviral remdesivir. To prevent shortages, researchers have come up with a new way to design synthetic routes to drugs now being tested in some COVID-19 clinical trials, using artificial intelligence (AI) software. The AI-planned new recipes—for 11 medicines so far—could help manufacturers produce medications whose syntheses are tightly held trade secrets. And because the new methods use cheap, readily available starting materials, licensed drug suppliers could quickly ramp up production of any promising therapies.\\n“If you are going to supply a drug to the world, your starting materials have to be cheap and as available as sugar,” says Danielle Schultz, a chemist at Merck. The new method, posted as a preprint this week, “is really solid,” she says. “I am impressed by the speed at which [the researchers] were able to find new solutions for making existing drugs.”\\nPatents give pharmaceutical companies the right to be the sole supplier of a new drug in a given country, usually for 20 years. Once a drug goes off patent, other companies can produce and sell it as a generic. The method to make the drug is often secret to discourage competition even after patents expire. But COVID-19 has changed all that, Schultz says. “We are at a time when it’s all hands on deck.”\\nCurrently, only two medicines—remdesivir and dexamethasone—have proved to fight COVID-19. That has led to supply shortages for both. On 4 August, attorneys general from 34 U.S. states wrote federal officials, calling remdesivir supplies “dangerously limited,” and urging states be given “march-in rights” to violate owner Gilead Sciences’s patents. Such rights would allow states to work with third-party manufacturers to make additional supplies of the drug.\\nTo prevent future supply crunches, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, chemist Timothy Cernak and colleagues turned to a commercial drug synthesis AI program called Synthia. The software can help pharmaceutical manufacturers find the most efficient and cost-effective strategy for synthesizing medicines, most of which are fairly complex molecules that can be built in myriad ways—much as an artist can apply brush strokes in infinite combinations to paint the same landscape. “It’s more options than the human mind can comprehend,” Cernak says.\\nCernak and his colleagues scoured the research and patent literature for ways to synthesize 12 medications now being tested as COVID-19 therapies, including remdesivir. They then programmed Synthia to search for new synthetic solutions. They limited their search to options that used cheap, abundant starting materials, didn’t require expensive catalysts or equipment, and could produce kilogram-scale amounts of drug.\\nIn the end, the software found novel solutions for making 11 out of the 12 compounds, including generic antivirals umifenovir and favipiravir, the researchers report this week in a non–peer-reviewed preprint on ChemRxiv. The AI program came up with four different ways to synthesize umifenovir, for example, in one case with cheaper starting materials than those now in use. “For the same amount of money [or less], we can make these drugs from different starting materials,” Cernak says. The one miss was remdesivir: The software was unable to come up with a solution for making it other than the way than Gilead does, he says.\\nCernak says he and his team filed patents on all of their new synthetic routes. But their goal isn’t to make a profit. Instead, they want to license their manufacturing approaches to one or more pharmaceutical companies to ensure adequate supplies and low prices.\\nNow, he adds, they wait and see whether any of the drugs prove effective in clinical trials.',\n",

       " \"Do Not Be an Oblivious Drug Dealer: Part 1\\nMarilyn Bulloch, PharmD, BCPS\\nWritten with Ashley Stokes and Mary Claire Blackmon, PharmD Candidates 2017 at the Auburn University Harrison School of PharmacyIt is estimated that 54 million people have used medications inappropriately at least once in their life.Following alcohol and marijuana, prescription drugs and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and supplements are the most commonly-abused substances in Americans aged 14 years and older. Drug abuse with OTC drugs can be misconceived as being safer than other illegal substances or prescription medications since they are sold without a prescription. Abuse of these agents are particularly popular with young people since they are readily accessible.\\nSmoking Alcohol\\nSmoking alcohol is alcohol (liquor, beer, etc.) that is vaporized by dry ice or pressure. When inhaled, the alcohol enters into the lungs and travels straight to the bloodstream.2 The alcohol bypasses the stomach and liver, so it is not metabolized. The effects of alcohol are felt almost immediately. Furthermore, the protective mechanism of vomiting from excess alcohol is lost. This can increase the individual's risk of alcohol poisoning and alcohol-related death.3 Inhaling alcohol has been shown to be more addictive than drinking it. People trying to lose weight are trying this method to obtain the effects of alcohol without the calories. Smoked alcohol introduces the same dangerous interactions with prescription drugs as when orally ingested and patients who may be suspected of ingesting alcohol in this manner should be counseled appropriately.4\\nNutmeg\\nNutmeg is a commonly used food spice, originating from the Banda Islands in the Moluccas of Indonesia.5 Other than its role as a flavoring agent, nutmeg is used to make fragrances, essential oils, body butters, an abortifacient, an aphrodisiac, a larvicidal agent, and may serve as a substance of abuse.\\nFor abusive purposes, it can be chewed or ground into a fine powder and drank with a beverage. It has intoxicating and psychoactive effects when taken in large amounts of greater than 20 grams, a little more than a tablespoon. It is estimated that between 5 and 20 grams (approximately 1 to 3 ground nutmeg seeds from a local farmer's’ market) are required to induce any kind of pharmacologic activity and that use of 1 to 2 milligram per kilogram of nutmeg can induce central nervous system (CNS) effects such as hallucinations.5 Gastrointestinal symptoms of nutmeg intoxication, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, can appear quickly within a half hour after ingestion. Then, roughly 3 to 8 hours later, hallucinogenic effects may begin, and last up to 48 hours. Other associated effects that may occur include anticholinergic effects, flushing, rapid heart rate, stupor, and convulsions.\\nThe primary pharmacologic effects are speculated to be due to myristicin, a weak monoamine oxidase inhibitor found in nutmeg. It is chemically similar to mescaline, the active compound in peyote, which is a small desert cactus with a history of use in northern Mexico that produces auditory and visual hallucinations. It is believed that myristicin may be converted to MMDA, a psychomimetic amphetamine-like drug, in the liver. Effects of MMDA include euphoria, feelings of anxiety and loneliness, dizziness, and drowsiness. Myristicin is also active at serotonin receptors in the brain causing symptoms such as hypotension, sedation, and anesthesia.5 Myristicin is completely processed through the body within 48 hours, giving the agent such long-lasting effects. Another chemical found in nutmeg is elemicin. Elemicin is also active at serotonin receptors, and exhibits anti-depressive, hallucinogenic, and antihistaminic effects.\\nThere have been 2 documented deaths from nutmeg intoxication. An 8-year-old boy fell into a coma and died 24 hours after ingesting 2 nutmegs (approximately 14 grams), the equivalent of 560 mg/kg of myristicin.6 The second case is of a 55-year-old woman, who was found with a mixture of flunitrazepam (Rohypnol) and myristicin in her blood. Blood tests revealed a dose of 560-840 mg/kg of myristicin and 0.072 mcg/ml of flunitrazepam.6 One to 3 ground nutmegs contains about 210 mg of myristicin and 70 mg of elemicin. These findings were confirmed post-mortem by UV-VIS spectroscopy and quantified by HPLC. Death was attributed to the combination of both substances.\\nSaffron\\nSaffron is the world’s most expensive spice at $11,000 per kilogram. It has been used throughout history for its color, smell, taste, and medicinal purposes. More recently, it comes as a supplement used for various proposed but unconfirmed health benefits.\\nThe saffron stigmas, thread-like parts of the flower, contain 4 major bioactive ingredients: crocins, crocetin, picrocrocin, and safranal. Crocin has been shown to have serotonergic effects and has been proven to be as effective in depression in head-to-head trials with fluoxetine. For depression, the dose of saffron is one 30 mg supplement capsule daily for 6 to 8 weeks.7 However, saffron has been shown to have opioid-like effects that reduced reduced morphine withdrawal symptoms in mice.8 Finally, research has shown that saffron has a dose-dependent increase of dopamine and glutamate. For these properties, individuals are ingesting the saffron stigmas to obtain a high. Additionally, amounts greater than five grams (roughly one teaspoon) have uterine stimulant and abortifacient effects. High doses (12-20 grams or approximately one tablespoon) can be dangerous resulting in bleeding and/or death.7\\nCatnip\\nCatnip is a small plant of the mint family, native to parts of Asia, Europe, and China. Catnip is best known for the nature attraction that cats, both domestic and wild, exhibit toward the plant. To members of the feline family, catnip contains an attractant called nepetalactone, which causes feelings of relaxation, sleepiness, or anxiety when ingested by the cats.\\nFor humans, catnip is usually brewed into an herbal tea, juice or tincture, used for smoking by drying out its leaves, used as a culinary herb, and appliced topically for arthritis and hemorrhoid treatment. Catnip has been used for its wide variety of medicinal qualities an antispasmodic, carminative, diaphoretic, and as a sedative. It is contraindicated in pregnancy due to uterine stimulating effects and abortifacient properties. Catnip is abused for its marijuana-like effects that are produced by drinking it in a beverage or smoking its leaves. Small doses of about 1.5 grams can last approximately 2 to 3 hours.9 Doses of 4 grams or more induce sedation. Unintended effects of catnip abuse are nausea, dizziness, and a mild hang-over feeling that typically subsides within a few hours. Lethal doses of catnip in humans has not yet been determined.\\nActifed\\nActifed is the combination of pseudoephedrine and triprolidine, an alkylamine antihistamine. It is abused for its pseudoephedrine component, which can be extracted by dissolving and filtering the ground up tablets to make methamphetamine. The drug increases the release of dopamine in the brain that is associated with euphoria and a rush feeling. Short-term side effects are wakefulness, rapid/irregular heart rate, and increased blood pressure. Long-term side effects include, severe dental problems, itching, anxiety, paranoia, hallucinations, stroke, heart attack, and death.1\\nA case study has been published reporting paranoid psychosis after abusing Actifed. The amount consumed was one to two bottles over a 2-day period.9 In 2015, Nexafed was released as the only meth-deterring pseudoephedrine product. It contains special excipients that will polymerize when tampered with to create a thick gel.10 This is an excellent way for pharmacies to combat methamphetamine abuse.\\nDiphenhydramine\\nDiphenhydramine is inexpensive and easily accessible at drugstores. It has been shown to elevate mood, increase energy levels, and produce hallucinogenic effects. According to studies, doses of 300-700 mg, 12-28 diphenhydramine tablets or 120-280 ml of diphenhydramine liquid, are associated with hallucinogenic effects. Most abuse is from ingestion of the tablets; however, some abusers are particularly are fond of the gel capsules in which they can use for injection. The sedative side effect was thought to deter individuals from abusing it; however, there are reports that insomnia was actually experienced at higher doses. The anticholinergic action is associated with elevation of mood and hallucinogenic effects. Individuals will overdose on the diphenhydramine or combine it with other prescription drugs or alcohol to potentiate its effects. Other consequences of misuse are respiratory depression, altered mental status, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular effects.11\\nVisine\\nVisine ophthalmic drops contain tetrahydrozoline, an alpha agonist. This drug can act on many different alpha-receptors to inhibit sympathetic outflow, decrease neuron activity, and CNS depression.12 When Visine is ingested orally, it can produce drowsiness, coma, respiratory depression, and muscle flaccidity. In children 2-5 ml of 0.05% solution will produce coma. The dose in adults is unclear; a case report showed 30 ml of 0.05% Visine induced a light coma. The onset is 15 to 30 minutes and the duration of action is 12 to 24 hours. Due to its drowsiness and coma inducing, Visine is being used as a drug to facilitate sexual assault due to its solubility in drinks and tastelessness.13\\nDramamine\\nDramamine, or dimenhydrinate, is an over-the-counter medication used to treat motion sickness. It blocks histamine-1 receptors in the GI tract and the chemotrigger zone, and decreases vestibular stimulation. Dimenhydrinate is usually dosed at 50-100 mg per dose every four to six hours, with the maximum daily dose of 400 mg per day. Abusers seek the relaxing and sedative effects of the medication. But, when taken at high doses (exceeding 1 gram) this medication can cause delirium, amnesia, heart attacks, kidney problems and hallucinations.14 Dimenhydrinate has the potential to cause dependency. Abusers can experience tolerance after repeated use making it necessary to use higher and more dangerous doses to gain the sedative effects.14 Intoxication can be seen at doses ranging from 750-1250 mg, or 15-25 tablets, with the strong hallucinations and euphoria experienced at about 800 mg daily.14 The reported lethal dose of dimenhydrinate is variable, with cases of overdose and death at 25 mg/kg in adults.15 However, there is a case with an adult male ingesting 25 grams and developing torsades de pointes, but making a complete recovery.14 The first documented lethal overdose on dimenhydrinate occurred in 1993 when a 19-year-old woman ingested 5,000 mg, approximately one-hundred tablets, in less than one hour.14 The woman presented to the hospital in status epilepticus and having was experiencing ventricular arrhythmias. She experienced a severe neurologic deficit and minimal cerebral activity even after several attempts to stabilize her physiologic functions, and passed away after she was not able to recover.15\\nAs pharmacists, there is an opportunity to intervene in the abuse of OTC drug abuse. Potential signs of abuse include large quantities bought and the leading population for store bought produce abuse is adolescents. If a certain drug is identified as being abused in the pharmacy, actions can be taken to keep the drug out of view or limit sales and restrict amount bought. An extreme measure could be to discontinue stocking the product. As always, it is your discretion to refuse the sale of a product to an individual suspected of abusing drugs. Addiction is a serious problem, which individuals need help. Be knowledgeable about local treatment centers to which you could refer individuals for recovery support.15\\nReferences\\n1. NIDA (2017).

       " \"Australia continues to see steady drop in new HIV infections\\nAustralia continues to be at the forefront of reversing the increase in HIV infections, with a study released today showing that the number of new diagnoses in 2018 dropped 13% year-on-year, to 835 cases. The pace of the decline more than doubled from the previous year, according to the Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity in Society at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. New infections are at the lowest level in 18 years and the decline is seen across the country, says Rebecca Guy, a Kirby Institute epidemiologist.\\nThe decline in new infections is concentrated among men who have sex with men (MSM), particularly those born in Australia. But that good news is tempered by a modest drop in heterosexually acquired infections, from 238 to 189, and stubbornly persistent levels of new infections in Indigenous peoples, particularly those in remote areas. “Australia is tracking toward elimination of the transmission of HIV,” Guy says, though she and others emphasize there is still much work to be done.\\nThe downward trend in new infections among MSM has been gathering steam for several years, thanks to aggressive promotion of condom use, widely available testing, and successful efforts to get those infected quickly started on antiretroviral drugs, which drive down viral loads, making the host unlikely to pass HIV on to partners.\\nThis arsenal of tools got a big boost in April 2018, when the federal government added pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a daily pill that protects HIV-negative people from infection, to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme that subsidizes the medicines. This cut the cost of PrEP from AU$10,000 per year to just AU$480 per year, according to the government-funded healthdirect website. Those qualifying for greater subsidies pay even less.\\nThe number of individuals taking advantage of subsidized PrEP soared from just 1980 in April 2018 to 18,530 that December. The Kirby Institute figures that 41% of at-risk Australian men were on PrEP in 2017, says Andrew Grulich, a Kirby Institute medical epidemiologist. Coverage needs to be up to 75% “if we want to keep moving toward HIV elimination,” Grulich says. PrEP uptake is lagging among MSM not born in Australia. “Gay and bisexual men from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds really need to be a target for further PrEP rollout,” he says.\\nIt will be particularly challenging to drive down infections in Indigenous groups that suffer high infection rates among those who inject drugs. And diagnoses are typically made at a later stage of infection. This “very different picture” of HIV infection requires “targeted interventions to make sure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are not left behind,” says James Ward, an infectious disease specialist at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute in Adelaide.\\nStill, “the decline we're seeing nationwide in Australia is being seen in very few other places in the world,” Grulich says. The combination of preventions—condom promotion, treatment as prevention, and PrEP—all “act together to decrease HIV infections,” he says. He is convinced that the critical component in the progress is Australia's universal health care system, which provides “free or easily affordable access to testing, to treatment, and to PrEP.”\",\n",
       " 'One new drug promises to stop cancer from spreading to other organs. Another would treat blood cancer. A third would use the body’s immune system to kill tumours.\\nAll three show encouraging results, and need just one more step to be approved for use in the United States. The drugs have something else in common: They were created in China.\\nFor years, China’s drug industry concentrated on replicating Western medicines. Getting new drugs approved was a frustrating and time-consuming process. Companies thought ploughing millions of dollars into research and development was risky and stuck to safer revenue streams.\\nThe country is now pushing to play a bigger role in the global drug industry. Millions of people in China have cancer or diabetes, and the government has made pharmaceutical innovation a national priority. Officials have promised to speed up drug approvals, and to reverse a brain drain by luring scientists back home. The authorities are providing land, grants and tax breaks, and investing in research. The three new drugs will have to clear U.S. regulatory hurdles. If they do, they can stand as proof of China’s growing ability to produce cutting-edge treatments, part of a broader transformation of the country’s economy as it moves into higher-value and increasingly complex sectors.\\nChina’s drug development is in the earliest stages compared to the broader industry. Some experts say, however, that it is only a matter of time before China’s medical companies stand alongside Big Pharma giants like Pfizer and AstraZeneca.\\n“It’s not whether they are going to,” says Jonathan Wang, senior managing director of OrbiMed Asia, a health-care investment fund. “They are going to.”\\nFor now, access to quality drugs remains a problem in China. Many people buy medicines from Hong Kong and Macau — territories governed by separate laws. Online forums are devoted to discussing smuggling generics from India. Others buy the raw ingredients to make the drugs at home. Those who can afford it fly to the U.S.\\nNew focus\\nA growing number of companies are trying to address that shortfall. Hutchison China MediTech, a firm backed by Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing, started out in 2000 trying to develop the herbal drugs used in traditional Chinese medicine. In 2005, the company, known as Chi-Med, started developing cancer drugs. At its main laboratory in Shanghai, upward of 350 scientists are surrounded by rodents in testing rooms. More than half the scientists are at work trying to discover new drugs.\\nIn October, Chi-Med reported that more than 60% of patients in second-stage clinical trials had responded positively to its drug, savolitinib, which it is developing together with AstraZeneca. Savolitinib — the first drug of its kind — can be used to treat lung, kidney, gastric and colorectal cancers; it is often used in combination with other AstraZeneca drugs to shut down pathways that allow the cancer to spread. Chi-Med is awaiting more data. But if further tests get positive results, the company will apply for what is known as breakthrough therapy designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It still needs to run Phase 3 trials, the last step before seeking full approval from the FDA, but breakthrough therapy status would allow the final stage to be sped up. The trials involve drugs being tested, often against placebos, for their safety and effectiveness on as many as several thousand patients.\\nLaura Nelson Carney, an Asia-Pacific health care analyst at Bernstein Research, says that based on the industry average, the probability of success in Phase 3 trials is 60 to 70%.\\nIf all goes according to plan, regulatory approval could come in late 2019, at the earliest, says Christian Hogg, Chi-Med’s chief executive. “It takes 20 years to get an overnight success, and that’s where we are at the moment,” he says.\\nThe last time China produced a new drug for the global pharmaceutical industry was in the 1970s, when the Chinese scientist Tu Youyou was credited with the discovery of artemisinin after Mao Zedong asked her to come up with a cure for malaria. But global recognition did not come until much later, after the Swiss drugmaker Novartis bought the Chinese patent and started producing it in the late 1990s. Tu was eventually awarded a Nobel Prize in 2015.\\nThat is changing. Along with Chi-Med, another company, BeiGene, is already in Phase 3 trials globally for a drug used to treat a variety of lymphomas, the most common form of blood cancer, and an immunotherapy drug that aims to destroy tumours. It has also teamed up with Celgene and Merck to develop cancer drugs.\\nMs. Carney says she expected 20 or 30 Chinese-made drugs to seek Phase 3 trials in the U.S., the world’s biggest market for cancer drugs, within the next five years. Those that make it through will very likely be cheaper than those made by foreign companies, she says, based on current pricing patterns in China.\\nMeanwhile, Big Pharma is shrugging off its long-held fears of China’s rampant counterfeiting and cumbersome bureaucracy and setting up its own labs here. Johnson & Johnson, Novartis and Sanofi have all opened research centres in Shanghai to create drugs for Chinese patients. Executives say that the government has made inroads in toughening protections of pharmaceutical patents. And the pace of approvals has also quickened. In worst-case scenarios, drug companies needed to wait up to two years to get permission just to start clinical trials, which would then take several more years. The comparable waiting period in the U.S. is typically 30 days. Under Bi Jingquan, who was appointed the head of China’s Food and Drug Administration in 2015, the agency has begun cracking down on companies making low-quality drugs and agreed to accept foreign data for clinical trials.\\nNow, thanks to those shifts, as well as incentives offered by the government, scientists trained overseas are returning to China.\\nAfter 20 years in the United States with Eli Lilly and Pfizer, Joan Shen moved to Shanghai in 2011 to lead clinical trials for Pfizer. She now heads research and development for a Chinese biotech firm, I-Mab Biopharma. The local government has helped secure funding for the company, and provided laboratory space in a high-tech business park.\\n“The funds are chasing us,” she says, comparing the investment environment between China and the United States, “instead of us having to spend numerous hours convincing investors.”\\nDespite the optimism, Chinese pharmaceutical companies that want to go abroad still face obstacles. Competition among drugmakers in major markets like the U.S. is intense, and Chinese companies are hamstrung in particular by a lack of money committed to research.\\nJiangsu Hengrui, a Chinese company that has been moving toward developing new drugs from making generic ones, has the largest research budget of all Chinese drug firms. But its $180 million annual outlay pales in comparison with the $7.8 billion that Pfizer spent in 2016.\\nStill, with several drugs in early stage testing, it is targeting what Zhang Lianshan, the company’s head of research and development, described as its “ultimate goal”: regulatory approval in the U.S.\\n“If you have a drug approved by the U.S. FDA,” Mr. Zhang says, “that’s a true demonstration of innovation.” NYT',\n",

One of the reasons for the over-prescription, the report says was for health facilities to offload near-expiry medicines and improve on revenues. “When it comes to private clinics, you also have other goals . . . you have target revenues,” said a medical doctor. Researchers analysed mobile phone data in the donor supported M-TIBA programme where majority of hospital visits were due to respiratory tract infections.\\nSEE ALSO: 72 health workers contract Covid-19 as tally hit 2,989\\nThese infections included common cold, bronchitis, tonsillitis and other conditions some not normally recommended for antibiotics.\\nHigh degrees\\nPlos One\\nHowever, the study published recently in the journalshows antibiotics prescriptions rates for respiratory infections going up to 99.8 per cent. “These high degrees of prescription surpass levels recommended by national and international standard treatment guidelines,” says the study by Dutch researchers and the Gertrude’s Children’s Hospital, Nairobi. The eight-month study, analysed 36,210 visits at four clinics in Nairobi involving 21,913 patients with 85,484 prescriptions. It indicates only a few of the treatments were supported by comprehensive laboratory tests. Official treatment guidelines recommend no antibiotics for infections such as common cold and bronchitis, a major cause of hospital visits in Kenya. In this study, the antibiotic amoxicillin constituted nearly one-third 7,061 or 32.3 per cent of total antibiotic drug prescriptions.\\nSEE ALSO: Where is the Sh12m? Shame of frontline medics not yet housed\\nIn August, the World Health Organisation, warned of fake Augmentin (usually a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid) pills circulating in Kenya. “Money first. Guys go straight to the more expensive Amoxil-Clavulanic combination . . . they tend to think about money first,” said a doctor in the current study. Health workers also explained that they are under intense pressure from clinic owners to meet certain revenue targets. “You are not going to prescribe drugs worth Sh100 and yet you have the original drug worth Sh3,000. So, you will tend to move towards the more expensive drugs, and keep away from the cheap drugs that are supposed to be used at first,” said another medical doctor. In February 2019, the annual conference of the Kenya Medical Research Institute was told of widespread sale of substandard amoxicillin in many retail pharmacies in Nairobi. The researchers reported purchasing samples from retail pharmacies in seven wards in Nairobi - the CBD, Karen, South C, South B, Zimmerman, Kayole and Kibra.\\nSEE ALSO: Health workers will now receive allowances\\nAfter laboratory analysis, 46 per cent of the samples were confirmed to be of poor quality. In the current study, however, the researchers asked patients’ and healthcare providers the cause of excessive drug prescriptions. “Sometimes clinics want to offload near-expiry drugs,” said a clinical officer. Some distributors give doctors or clinics huge discounts on near-expiring drugs for the quick offload on patients. The Kenya Health System Assessment report published in June 2019 by the Ministry of Health and USAID said Kenya has the fourth highest Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) reporting rate in Africa.\\nOver-prescription\\nOther reasons for over-prescription in the current study was due to high patient load, clinician and patient perceptions that clinicians should prescribe, lack of access to laboratory tests and the use of obsolete treatment guidelines.\\nSEE ALSO: Healthworkers to get allowances\\nThe health workers were especially worried over an increasing number of ‘Google-patients’ in Kenya. “These are patients who already have the symptoms; they turn to Google, then come to you in a panic, and get annoyed when you do not give them antibiotics,” said a doctor.',\n",

This new study of 91 patients with cutaneous melanoma is the third recent publication demonstrating that the DecisionDx-Melanoma test impacts one in two clinical management decisions.\\nThe paper titled, “Impact of Gene Expression Profiling on Decision-Making in Clinically Node Negative Melanoma Patients after Surgical Staging,” was recently published by researchers from Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) in the Journal of Drugs in Dermatology.

A majority of the patients studied (88%) were Stage I or II.\\nPatients were retrospectively grouped based on recommended follow-up plan: 1) dermatology alone, 2) surgical oncology, 3) surgical oncology with recommendation for adjuvant trial, or 4) medical and surgical oncology. The impact of DecisionDx-Melanoma test results on decisions regarding follow-up recommendations was assessed.\\nKey Study Findings:\\nIn this pathologically staged population, 52 patients (58%) had a Class 1 (low risk) result and 38 (42%) had a Class 2 (high risk) result.\\nOverall the follow-up recommendations for Class 1 (low risk) and Class 2 (high risk) patients were found to be significantly different (P<0.001), with Class 2 patients receiving more aggressive follow-up.\\nUsing a prediction model, the DecisionDx-Melanoma test was found to account for 52% of the decisions regarding patients’ follow-up plans. As a comparison, approximately 20% of patients undergoing SLNB are found to be positive.\\nFor patients who received a Class 1 DecisionDx-Melanoma test result, the majority (58%) were followed by dermatology alone. No Class 2 patients were followed by dermatology alone.\\nAll patients who received a Class 2 result were followed by surgical oncology, with or without the recommendation for an adjuvant trial or consultation by medical oncology, compared to 42% of Class 1 patients.\\nFor Stage I patients, 82% of those with a Class 1 result were followed by dermatology alone; all Stage I patients with a Class 2 result were followed by surgical oncology with or without recommendation for adjuvant trial.\\n“The finding that the 31-gene expression profile test significantly impacted patient management decisions in this study aligns with previous publications demonstrating that the test impacts clinical decision-making in approximately 50% of patients tested,” noted study co-author John Vetto, M.D., FACS, Professor of Surgery and Director of the Department of Surgery Cutaneous Oncology Program at OHSU. “It is important to have risk assessment strategies such as the 31-gene expression profile test that allow accurate identification of high-risk patients for more aggressive interventions and appropriate allocation of follow-up resources for low-risk patients.”\\nThe publication may be accessed on the journal’s website at: http://jddonline.com/articles/dermatology/S1545961618P0196X\\nAn interim analysis of this study was previously presented at the 2017 Society of Surgical Oncology Annual Cancer Symposium in Seattle, WA.\\nAbout DecisionDx-Melanoma\\nThe DecisionDx-Melanoma test uses tumor biology to predict individual risk of melanoma recurrence and sentinel lymph node positivity independent of traditional factors. Using tissue from the primary melanoma, the test measures the expression of 31 genes. The test has been validated in three multi-center studies that have included 690 patients and have demonstrated consistent results. Performance has also been confirmed in four prospective studies including 702 patients. The consistent high performance and accuracy demonstrated in these studies, which combined have included over 1300 patients, provides confidence in disease management plans that incorporate DecisionDx-Melanoma test results. Prediction of the likelihood of sentinel lymph node positivity has also been validated in two prospective multicenter studies that included over 1400 patients. Clinical impact has been demonstrated in multi-center and single-center studies showing that test results impact approximately 1 in 2 clinical management decisions.

       " 'Particularly in the case of accelerated drug approvals and drugs for rare diseases (orphan drugs), the evidence available at the time of market access is often insufficient for the early benefit assessment of drugs. Often, the studies are too short or no data on patient-relevant outcomes were collected. Comparisons with the German standard of care are also often lacking. In order to close such evidence gaps, in future, routine practice data are also to be included in early benefit assessments of drugs.\\nBut how must the data be collected and processed so that they can be used by the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) for benefit assessments in Germany? In order to answer this question, the G-BA commissioned the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) to develop scientific concepts for the generation of routine practice data and their analysis for benefit assessments of drugs - especially with regard to the option of quantifying the added benefit of a new drug. According to the \"Gesetz für mehr Sicherheit in der Arzneimittelversorgung\" (GSAV, Law for More Safety in the Supply of Medicines), the G-BA may in future commission the collection of routine practice data on selected drugs to support the quantification of added benefit.\\nSummarizing the most important result of the IQWiG analysis, Jürgen Windeler, IQWiG\\'s Director, notes: \"Extensive analyses of the methodological literature and intensive discussions with registry operators and external statisticians have led us to the conclusion that, in the case of high-quality patient registries, it is possible to base studies on these registries and use the routine practice data collected for extended benefit assessments of drugs.\"\\nSuch registry studies can be conducted either with or without randomization, but the high quality of the data is the decisive factor in both cases.\\nIn order to support the individual registries in particular and the registry landscape in Germany in general in the collection of routine practice data, on the basis of current national and international recommendations, IQWiG compiled criteria for data quality and for ensuring data quality for routine practice data collections for benefit assessments of drugs, condensed them to the essentials, and organized them in a clear and concise manner. In addition, the rapid report provides registry operators, sponsors of registry studies as well as health policy decision-makers with specific recommendations for action on how the collection of routine practice data in registries can be made usable for benefit assessments of drugs.\\nFocus on collection of routine practice data in registries\\nRoutine practice data are data collected within the context of usual health care in patient populations that can receive the drug under assessment in the approved therapeutic indication. The data can be collected in studies with or without randomization.\\nIn their rapid report, the IQWiG authors describe that the use of routine practice data for benefit assessments of drugs mandatorily requires a comparison between the new drug and the comparator therapy specified by the G-BA, which makes it necessary to conduct comparative studies. In general, four data collection tools are available for comparative studies: study-specific data collection as well as data collection from registries, electronic patient records, and claims data of health insurance funds.\\nThe IQWiG authors are convinced that the collection and processing of routine practice data from electronic patient records and claims data from health insurance funds is currently not possible with regard to benefit assessments of drugs and will not be possible in the near future. This is mainly because the data quality in these sources is insufficient and important data are not collected. These problems cannot be solved in the short or medium term. In contrast, the assessment of disease-related patient registries yielded positive results.\\nData quality of registries has improved\\nAs the IQWiG authors note, of the data collection tools not primarily geared towards comparative studies, registries are most likely to offer the option of adapting the data collection requirements for these studies. This concerns both the specification of the necessary data and the data quality.\\nThe authors also note that the question as to whether existing patient registries are currently suitable for the collection of routine practice data according to §35a Social Code Book (SGB V) cannot be answered in a general way. This depends on the respective registry and, above all, on the specific research questions posed. In the discussions with selected registry operators, however, it also became apparent that from a technical and organizational point of view, the registries are generally prepared to implement any necessary extensions of the data set.\\nThomas Kaiser, Head of IQWiG\\'s Drug Assessment Department explains:\\nIn recent years, the objectives and scope of documentation of registries have been extended. In particular, the increasing documentation of clinical information in registries that can be used to describe patient populations, interventions and outcomes for benefit assessments is an important step forward. For certain research questions, data on patient-reported outcomes should also be included in registries. This is already the case in some registries.\"\\nBenefit assessments always require fair comparisons\\nAs emphasized by the IQWiG authors, if routine practice data are to be used in benefit assessments, it must be taken into account that the basis of any conclusion on the effects of interventions is a comparison. This is because only on the basis of a comparison is it possible to distinguish between \"after intervention A\" and \"due to intervention A\"; this distinction is necessary for a causal conclusion. A comparison is only meaningful if the starting conditions are fair (similarity of the groups in terms of prognostic factors). Ideally, this is achieved through randomization, i.e. the random allocation of study participants to the two study arms.\\nWhen studies are conducted without randomization, the adjustment of interfering factors (confounders) is an essential part of the assessment. For this purpose, the relevant confounders - such as the severity of a concomitant disease or a genetic mutation - must be determined and documented in the data collection. The completeness and accuracy of the data on confounders is just as important as that of the other data. Depending on the research question and the data already available, it may therefore be less resource-intensive to conduct a study with randomization.\\nAs the IQWiG authors note, in order to be able to use routine practice comparative studies for benefit assessments, it should already be ensured in the study planning phase that the study process and the data collected are of the necessary quality to produce interpretable results.\\nThey therefore compiled a clear list of criteria to ensure that only data of sufficient quality are used. This list is divided into four categories: mandatory criteria for ensuring data quality; general criteria that are always relevant for registry studies used in benefit assessments of drugs; general criteria that, depending on the research question, are relevant for registry studies used in benefit assessments of drugs; and criteria whose degree of fulfilment is to be assessed in relation to the research question.\\nThomas Kaiser notes:\\nIn the context of the suitability testing of a specific registry, this list should be used to evaluate for the respective research question whether all necessary data have been collected or whether possible deficits can be corrected with reasonable effort in a registry-based study.\"\\nWithout randomization, no more than a hint of an effect is conceivable\\nThe smaller the expected differences in treatment effects in a comparison, the more important is a fair comparison in terms of the similarity of the groups in terms of prognostic factors described above. From this, the IQWiG authors conclude that from comparative studies without randomization, a conclusion drawn from the observed effects with regard to the benefit or harm of an intervention is only meaningful if a certain effect size is exceeded. Otherwise, it cannot be excluded that the observed effect was not caused by the intervention, but by confounders. Since without randomization it cannot be excluded, even in a good study, that unknown confounders may influence the results, it is therefore generally not possible to derive more than a hint of an effect from comparative studies without randomization.\\nAccording to IQWiG\\'s analysis, whether it is possible to consider retrospective study designs depends on whether the available data sources contain the necessary data in the required quality. Thus, comparisons of patient populations receiving a new drug with patient populations comprising historical controls only appear realistic if the same data source is used for both (e.g. a disease-specific clinical registry).\\nRegistry-based randomized trials as an option\\nIn general, comparative studies with randomization always have a higher informative value than those without randomization. They remain the gold standard because quantification of the added benefit is more reliable. The IQWiG authors emphasize that, particularly after drug approval, routine practice comparative trials with randomization can - depending on the existing research question - also be conducted with a limited collection of data in \"large simple trials\". Conducting studies in registries has an additional potential to accelerate the studies and make them less complex and resource-intensive (registry-based comparative studies with randomization).\\nJürgen Windeler, IQWiG\\'s Director, concludes: \"The generation of routine practice data and their analysis is potentially feasible in the near future - but for the time being, in addition to study-specific data collection, only via data collection from registries. We have documented which data must be available in the registries and in what quality. The registry operators were very open-minded in their discussions with us, so I expect that the first data from high-quality registries will soon be available for use in benefit assessments of drugs.\" In this context, Windeler also calls on politicians to act: \"The conditions for high quality registries could be better. This concerns both funding and the fact that there are different requirements for data protection in different German federal states.\"\\nProcess of report production\\nOn 2 May 2019, the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) commissioned IQWiG to develop scientific concepts for the generation of routine practice data and their analysis for the benefit assessment of drugs. According to the commission, the report was to be prepared in an accelerated procedure as a so-called rapid report. Interim products were therefore not published or made available for a hearing. This rapid report was sent to the contracting agency, the G-BA, on 10 January 2020.',\n",

These drugs also yield the same therapeutic effect and are prescribed in the same dosing, with the same quality, and same the way of consumption and usage. However, the inactive ingredients of generic drugs can differ as compared to their branded counter parts. These drugs are mainly marketed after a patent expiry of a branded drug and are significantly lower in costs as compared to the patented branded drugs. Generic drugs are of equivalent quality as compared to the branded drugs and are manufactured under the same safety and manufacturing procedures. Various manufacturers submit an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) to the FDA after the completion of period of patent exclusivity.Browse report summery with TOC: https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/ongoing-insight/toc/1132 Patent expiry of branded drugs is a factor expected to boost growth of the global generic drugs marketManufacturers of generic drugs are focusing on development and introduction of various innovative medication and formulation such as biosimilars. According to IMS Health data, generic drugs accounted for over 80% of the prescriptions dispensed in the U.S. in 2013. The number of patents expiring in the near future serves to be a major driver for growth of generic drugs market. For instance, Cetuximab (Erbitux) is an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor that is indicated in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and head and neck cancer. It is manufactured under the patent by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Eli Lily Company in Europe. The drug’s patent expires in 2018 and thus, is expected to provide opportunity for a large number of market players to manufacture its generic version. Furthermore, supportive initiative by FDA to promote development of biosimilars is encouraging manufacturers to focus towards its development. For instance, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act in the U.S. gr ants 12 months patent exclusivity with higher profit margins to the first manufacturer than the conventional generic manufacturers bringing the drugs in market later. Various other factors contributing to growth of generic drugs market include rampant growth in incidence of chronic diseases. However, shortage of active pharmaceutical ingredients leading to unavailability of generics in the market and increasing FDA pressure on manufacturers regarding manufacturing quality of these drugs are hindering the market growth.Market TaxonomyThe global generic drugs market is segmented on the basis of drug type, therapeutic application, route of administration, and region.On the basis of Drug Type, the global generic drugs market is segmented into:Monoclonal Antibodies,Cytokines,Vaccines,Insulin,Peptide Hormones,Immunoglobulin,Peptide Antibiotics,Blood Factors,Others,.On the basis of Therapeutic Application, the global generic drugs market is segmented into:Oncology,Cardiovascular Diseases,Neurology,Infectious Diseases,Musculoskeletal Diseases,Others,.Based on Route of Administration, the global generic drugs market is segmented into:Oral,Topical,Injectable,Intra-venous,Others,.Ask for customization: https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/insight/request-customization/1132 Asia Pacific to gain significant traction in the global generic drugs market owing to increasing number of local playersOn the basis of region, the global generic drugs market is segmented into North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa. North America held a dominant position in the global generic drugs market in 2016. This is attributed to favorable regulatory policies that are revised and amended to encourage generic drugs business in the region. For instance, Generic Drug User Fee Amendment (GDFUA) was reauthorized in 2017 after its initiation in 2012 by FDA for increasing consumer access to high quality, safe, and affordable drugs. On the other hand, Asia Pacific is expected to show a significant traction in the market over the forecast period. This is attributed to lower manufacturing costs and high skilled workforce in the Asian countries. According to India Brand Equity Foundation, India has the second largest number of U.S. FDA manufacturing plants outside the U.S. that are involved in generic drugs manufacturing. Additionally, the cost of manufacturing is 33% lower in India than that in the U.S., increasing accessibility to generics in these countries.New drug launches and market approvals from the U.S. FDA to generic manufacturers are bolstering growth of the generic drugs market. For instance, in December 2017, Zydus Phamaceuticals — a subsidiary of Cadila Healthcare — received U.S. FDA approval to market Pramipexole Dihydrochloride extended-release tablets for the treatment of Parkinson ’s disease in the U.S. market. Key players operating in the global generic drugs market are Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Mylan N.V., Novartis International AG, Pfizer, Inc., Allergan Plc, Sun Pharmaceuticals, Fresenius Kabi, Sanofi, Endo International, Lupin Ltd., Abbott Healthcare, AstraZeneca Plc, and Novo Nordisk.To know more about the Generic Drugs Market, click the link below, https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/ongoing-insight/generic-drugs-market-1132 About Coherent Market Insights:Coherent Market Insights is a prominent market research and consulting firm offering action-ready syndicated research reports, custom market analysis, consulting services, and competitive analysis through various recommendations related to emerging market trends, technologies, and potential absolute dollar opportunity.Contact Us:Mr. ShahCoherent Market Insights1001 4th Ave,#3200Seattle, WA 98154Tel: +1-206-701-6702Email: sales@ coherentmarketinsights.com Visit our news Website: http://www.coherentnews.com',\n",

       " 'OYUB TITIEV suspected the day would come. As head of the Chechen branch of Memorial, a Russian human-rights group, his activities angered the region’s authorities. His predecessor, Natalia Estemirova, was kidnapped and murdered in 2009. No-one has been punished for the crime. Mr Titiev (pictured) received death threats himself. He warned friends and colleagues that he could be arrested any time. “They’ll plant drugs,” he told a friend.\\nMr Titiev’s fears were justified. On January 9th Chechen police arrested him, claiming to have found some 180 grams of marijuana in a plastic bag inside his car. He was charged with drug possession and faces up to ten years in prison. Mr Titiev reported that officers threatened reprisals against his family if he did not plead guilty. The arrest looks like an attempt to force Memorial to cease its work in the region, where it has long documented torture and disappearances. On January 17th the Memorial office in neighbouring Ingushetia was burned down.\\nThe Chechen authorities have a history of using fabricated drug cases to deal with critics. Ruslan Kataev, another human-rights activist, was arrested on drug charges in 2014, and released only late last year. Some two years later, Zhalaudi Geriev, an independent journalist, was sentenced on similar grounds; he remains behind bars. Both men were tortured in custody, says Human Rights Watch. The charges against Mr Titiev would be comical were they not so sinister. Friends and colleagues note that the 60-year-old Mr Titiev, a devout Muslim, neither drank nor smoked and began most days by running.\\nRussia’s federal authorities have limited influence over Chechnya’s internal affairs. The Kremlin depends on the Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, to preserve stability in the turbulent republic. Mr Kadyrov, in turn, is allowed to run the republic as a private fiefdom, with his own army.\\nMr Kadyrov has been the target of particular criticism in the West for alleged human-rights abuses. He was recently added to America’s “Magnitsky List” in connection with his alleged involvement “in disappearances and extrajudicial killings”, including an anti-gay purge that swept the republic in early 2017. That led to Mr Kadyrov being banned from Western social networks such as Facebook and Instagram, which he used to communicate with millions of followers. The ban greatly irritated the Chechen leadership. The speaker of parliament, Magomed Daudov, described human-rights activists as “enemies” with “foreign bosses” and added: “If only Russia hadn’t had a moratorium [on the death penalty], we could’ve just bid these enemies of the people ‘salaam alaikum’ and been done with them.”',\n",

       " 'Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, whose war on drugs has resulted in the deaths of over 12,000 people allegedly using and dealing drugs, has announced that the country will withdraw from the establishing treaty of the International Criminal Court.\\nHis statement comes about a month after the ICC launched a preliminary investigation into those deaths. Human Rights Watch has called Duterte\\'s term a \"human rights calamity,\" as his administration \"has rejected all domestic and international calls for accountability for these abuses, and instead has denied any government responsibility for the thousands of drug war deaths.\"\\nDuterte, whose term began in June 2016, promised to kill every drug dealer and user in the Philippines in his presidential campaign. Police officials and vigilantes alike have contributed to the killings.\\nThe ICC launches investigations when a member state is unwilling to carry out investigations and prosecute suspected perpetrators themselves. Duterte claims this is not the case: \"The deaths [have occurred] in the process of legitimate police operation\" who didn\\'t intend to kill, but acted in self-defense,\" he said.\\nThe HRW\\'s 2018 World Report disputes his claims.\\n\"Police have planted guns, spent ammunition, and drug packets on victims\\' bodies to implicate them in drug activities,\" it reads. \"Masked gunmen taking part in killings appeared to be working closely with police, casting doubt on government claims that most killings have been committed by vigilantes or rival drug gangs. No one has been meaningfully investigated, let alone prosecuted, for any of the \\'drug war\\' killings.\"\\nNPR reported on the scope of Duterte\\'s war on drugs last November:\\n\"Inside the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has maintained support for his bloody war on drugs, despite the thousands of lives lost and criticism by human rights groups. \"Duterte has remained popular because most people in the country aren\\'t directly affected by deadly drug war, which is mostly being waged in the inner cities. \"Since taking office last year, Duterte continues to carry out his pledge to kill every drug dealer and user in the country. Human rights groups say the deadly extra-judicial war has left more than 13,000 people dead. \"... Duterte has a much-maligned history of cracking down on drugs. When he won the presidential election last year, Duterte touted his 20 years as mayor of Davao in Mindanao in his promise to rid the country of drugs and crime. But as The Guardian reports, Davao still has the highest murder rate in the country and the second highest number of rapes. \"The scope of Duterte\\'s vicious war in the Philippines echoes that first violent campaign in Davao. When he ordered the first death squad to target drug dealers and users in 1989, he allegedly told police officers: \"Throw them in the ocean or the quarry. Make it clean. Make sure there are no traces of the bodies.\"\\nThe ICC uses preliminary investigations to determine if there\\'s \"a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation pursuant to the criteria established by the Rome Statute,\" said ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda.\\nIn Oct. 2016, Bensouda said she was \"deeply concerned about these alleged killings and the fact that public statements of high officials of the Republic of the Philippines seem to condone such killings.\"\\n\"An international law cannot supplant, prevail or diminish a domestic law,\" reads Duterte\\'s statement. \"I therefore declare and forthwith give notice, as President of the Republic of the Philippines, that the Philippines is withdrawing its ratification of the Rome Statute effective immediately.\"\\nWithdrawing from the Rome Statue doesn\\'t let the Philippines off the hook to a more comprehensive ICC investigation or human rights abuse charges, however. \"A State shall not be discharged, by reason of its withdrawal, from the obligations arising from the Rome Statute while it was a party to the Statute,\" reads the document\\'s Article 127.\\nThe same article also states that withdrawals from the Rome Statute shall take place one year or later after a state notifies the United Nations of its intent to withdraw.\\n\"There appears to be fraud in entering such agreement,\" counters Duterte\\'s statement. The president dared the ICC to jail him last month, saying, \"If you haul me into a rigmarole of trial and trial, no need. Go ahead and proceed in your investigation. Find me guilty, of course. You can do that.\"\\n\"Looks like they are really afraid. Why? They feel that this will proceed to an investigation,\" Jude Sabio, an ICC lawyer, told Reuters.

The fibroids otherwise called leiomyomas, uterine myomas or fibromas. These are compact tumors which are made up of smooth muscle and fibrous connective tissue that develops in uterus.Uterine fibroids most commonly found during routinepelvic examination. Smaller fibroids may not found during the normal examination, ultrasound examination may require. And physicians may suggest the diagnostic imaging techniques such as Ultrasound, saline infusion sonography, MRI or compound tomography for the detection of the fibroids in uterus.Generally, uterine fibroids treatment may include minimally invasive procedures such as hysterectomy, myomectomy and uterine artery embolization. Gonadotropin-releasing hormones are used to lower the levels of estrogen and triggers “medical menopause” and sometimes these hormones shrink the fibroids and make surgical treatment easier.

Ken Foster said about half of those vehicles were occupied by criminals when police arrived.\\nFoster along with other RCMP officers recognized the resident’s contributions recently. DM was presented with a plaque at a reception in front of attendees including DM’s family, RCMP officers, and several call takers.\\n“We’ve recovered firearms, drugs and large amounts of stolen identity documents from these vehicles,” said Foster.\\nDM doesn’t want to use his real name, because it’s the anonymity that allows him to spot and call in hundreds of stolen vehicles.\\nHe started calling the RCMP after his own vehicle was stolen few years ago when he left it unlocked and running. He reported his stolen car to the RCMP and started looking for it himself.\\nIt didn’t take long for him to find it parked in a retail lot, still occupied by the suspect. He called RCMP and the man behind the wheel was arrested. The vehicle was full of stolen property from a Red Deer business.\\n“Take it from someone who did it,” DM said, about leaving his car unlocked and running, “I enabled him to get down to (the store) and clean them out.”\\nThe experience prompted DM’s involvement with “Central Alberta Stolen Vehicles,” a Facebook page, with about 10,000 followers.

       " 'The drug war goes far beyond arrests and incarceration. Its roots are deeply embedded in almost every aspect of daily life – from education, housing, and employment, to child welfare, immigration, and public benefits. We must fully extract the drug war and its culture of criminalization from our lives.\\nLearn more about how the drug war harms everyone at UprootingTheDrugWar.org.\\nThe Early Stages of Drug Prohibition\\nMany currently illegal drugs, such as marijuana, opium, coca, and psychedelics have been used for thousands of years for both medical and spiritual purposes. So why are some drugs legal and other drugs illegal today? It\\'s not based on any scientific assessment of the relative risks of these drugs – but it has everything to do with who is associated with these drugs.\\nThe first anti-opium laws in the 1870s were directed at Chinese immigrants. The first anti-cocaine laws in the early 1900s were directed at black men in the South. The first anti-marijuana laws, in the Midwest and the Southwest in the 1910s and 20s, were directed at Mexican migrants and Mexican Americans. Today, Latino and especially black communities are still subject to wildly disproportionate drug enforcement and sentencing practices.\\nNixon and the Generation Gap\\nIn the 1960s, as drugs became symbols of youthful rebellion, social upheaval, and political dissent, the government halted scientific research to evaluate their medical safety and efficacy.\\nIn June 1971, President Nixon declared a “war on drugs.” He dramatically increased the size and presence of federal drug control agencies, and pushed through measures such as mandatory sentencing and no-knock warrants.\\nA top Nixon aide, John Ehrlichman, later admitted: “You want to know what this was really all about. The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying. We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”Nixon temporarily placed marijuana in Schedule One, the most restrictive category of drugs, pending review by a commission he appointed led by Republican Pennsylvania Governor Raymond Shafer.\\nIn 1972, the commission unanimously recommended decriminalizing the possession and distribution of marijuana for personal use. Nixon ignored the report and rejected its recommendations.\\nBetween 1973 and 1977, however, eleven states decriminalized marijuana possession. In January 1977, President Jimmy Carter was inaugurated on a campaign platform that included marijuana decriminalization. In October 1977, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to decriminalize possession of up to an ounce of marijuana for personal use.\\nWithin just a few years, though, the tide had shifted. Proposals to decriminalize marijuana were abandoned as parents became increasingly concerned about high rates of teen marijuana use. Marijuana was ultimately caught up in a broader cultural backlash against the perceived permissiveness of the 1970s.\\nThis video from hip hop legend Jay Z and acclaimed artist Molly Crabapple depicts the drug war’s devastating impact on the Black community from decades of biased law enforcement.\\nThe video traces the drug war from President Nixon to the draconian Rockefeller Drug Laws to the emerging aboveground marijuana market that is poised to make legal millions for wealthy investors doing the same thing that generations of people of color have been arrested and locked up for. After you watch the video, read on to learn more about the discriminatory history of the war on drugs.\\nThe 1980s and 90s: Drug Hysteria and Skyrocketing Incarceration Rates\\nThe presidency of Ronald Reagan marked the start of a long period of skyrocketing rates of incarceration, largely thanks to his unprecedented expansion of the drug war. The number of people behind bars for nonviolent drug law offenses increased from 50,000 in 1980 to over 400,000 by 1997.\\nPublic concern about illicit drug use built throughout the 1980s, largely due to media portrayals of people addicted to the smokeable form of cocaine dubbed “crack.” Soon after Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, his wife, Nancy Reagan, began a highly-publicized anti-drug campaign, coining the slogan \"Just Say No.\"\\nThis set the stage for the zero tolerance policies implemented in the mid-to-late 1980s. Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates, who believed that “casual drug users should be taken out and shot,” founded the DARE drug education program, which was quickly adopted nationwide despite the lack of evidence of its effectiveness. The increasingly harsh drug policies also blocked the expansion of syringe access programs and other harm reduction policies to reduce the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS.\\nIn the late 1980s, a political hysteria about drugs led to the passage of draconian penalties in Congress and state legislatures that rapidly increased the prison population. In 1985, the proportion of Americans polled who saw drug abuse as the nation\\'s \"number one problem\" was just 2-6 percent. The figure grew through the remainder of the 1980s until, in September 1989, it reached a remarkable 64 percent – one of the most intense fixations by the American public on any issue in polling history. Within less than a year, however, the figure plummeted to less than 10 percent, as the media lost interest. The draconian policies enacted during the hysteria remained, however, and continued to result in escalating levels of arrests and incarceration.\\nAlthough Bill Clinton advocated for treatment instead of incarceration during his 1992 presidential campaign, after his first few months in the White House he reverted to the drug war strategies of his Republican predecessors by continuing to escalate the drug war. Notoriously, Clinton rejected a U.S. Sentencing Commission recommendation to eliminate the disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences.\\nHe also rejected, with the encouragement of drug czar General Barry McCaffrey, Health Secretary Donna Shalala’s advice to end the federal ban on funding for syringe access programs. Yet, a month before leaving office, Clinton asserted in a Rolling Stone interview that \"we really need a re-examination of our entire policy on imprisonment\" of people who use drugs, and said that marijuana use \"should be decriminalized.\"\\nAt the height of the drug war hysteria in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a movement emerged seeking a new approach to drug policy. In 1987, Arnold Trebach and Kevin Zeese founded the Drug Policy Foundation – describing it as the “loyal opposition to the war on drugs.” Prominent conservatives such as William Buckley and Milton Friedman had long advocated for ending drug prohibition, as had civil libertarians such as longtime ACLU Executive Director Ira Glasser. In the late 1980s they were joined by Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke, Federal Judge Robert Sweet, Princeton professor Ethan Nadelmann, and other activists, scholars and policymakers.\\nIn 1994, Nadelmann founded The Lindesmith Center as the first U.S. project of George Soros’ Open Society Institute. In 2000, the growing Center merged with the Drug Policy Foundation to create the Drug Policy Alliance.\\nThe New Millennium: The Pendulum Shifts – Slowly – Toward Sensible Drug Policy\\nGeorge W. Bush arrived in the White House as the drug war was running out of steam – yet he allocated more money than ever to it. His drug czar, John Walters, zealously focused on marijuana and launched a major campaign to promote student drug testing. While rates of illicit drug use remained constant, overdose fatalities rose rapidly.\\nThe era of George W. Bush also witnessed the rapid escalation of the militarization of domestic drug law enforcement. By the end of Bush\\'s term, there were about 40,000 paramilitary-style SWAT raids on Americans every year – mostly for nonviolent drug law offenses, often misdemeanors. While federal reform mostly stalled under Bush, state-level reforms finally began to slow the growth of the drug war.\\nPoliticians now routinely admit to having used marijuana, and even cocaine, when they were younger. When Michael Bloomberg was questioned during his 2001 mayoral campaign about whether he had ever used marijuana, he said, \"You bet I did – and I enjoyed it.\" Barack Obama also candidly discussed his prior cocaine and marijuana use: \"When I was a kid, I inhaled frequently – that was the point.\"\\nPublic opinion has shifted dramatically in favor of sensible reforms that expand health-based approaches while reducing the role of criminalization in drug policy.\\nMarijuana reform has gained unprecedented momentum throughout the Americas. Alaska, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for adults. In December 2013, Uruguay became the first country in the world to legally regulate marijuana. Canada legalized marijuana for adults in 2018.\\nIn response to a worsening overdose epidemic, dozens of U.S. states passed laws to increase access to the overdose antidote, naloxone, as well as “911 Good Samaritan” laws to encourage people to seek medical help in the event of an overdose.\\nYet the assault on American citizens and others continues, with 700,000 people still arrested for marijuana offenses each year and almost 500,000 people still behind bars for nothing more than a drug law violation.\\nPresident Obama, despite supporting several successful policy changes – such as reducing the crack/powder sentencing disparity, ending the ban on federal funding for syringe access programs, and ending federal interference with state medical marijuana laws – did not shift the majority of drug policy funding to a health-based approach.\\nTrump Era: DPA Pushes Forward Despite Challenges\\nThe Trump administration threatened to take us backward toward a 1980s-style drug war. President Trump started building a wall to keep drugs out of the country, and called for harsher sentences for drug law violations and the death penalty for people who sell drugs. He also resurrected disproven “just say no” messaging aimed at youth.\\n2020 brought the additional challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic – a public health crisis that exposed the systemic issues within our society and revealed just how deeply the drug war permeates these systems. People who interact with these systems are unable to take the most basic of steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 – including those in jail or prison, the homeless, people with substance use disorder, those who rely on access to medication-assisted treatment or medical marijuana, and immigrants. During this crisis, it is harder for them to engage in social distancing, and to access necessary medication assisted treatment – such as methadone or buprenorphine, or medical marijuana – as well as other health and harm reduction resources.\\nDespite these obstacles, we at the Drug Policy Alliance pushed forward with monumental drug policy reforms in the 2020 elections. In a historic, paradigm-shifting win and arguably the biggest blow to the war on drugs to date, Oregon voters passed Measure 110, the nation’s first all-drug decriminalization measure. This confirms a substantial shift in public support in favor of treating drug use with health services rather than with criminalization.\\nMarijuana reform also won big. Voters in Arizona, New Jersey, Montana, and South Dakota passed measures to legalize marijuana for adult use. It was also a historic year for medical marijuana, with victories in Mississippi and South Dakota.\\nAll across the country, in liberal states and conservative ones, people made their voices heard. And they said loud and clear that it is time to end the drug war.\\nNew Administration, New Opportunities\\nNow Joe Biden is President of the United States – and with every new administration brings new opportunities.\\nBiden has stated that it was a “mistake” to support legislation that ramped up the drug war and increased incarceration, including the \\'94 crime bill, when he was in the U.S. Senate. He now says we need a compassionate approach to problematic drug use.\\nAt the Drug Policy Alliance, we agree. And we’re ready to make change. We look forward to working together on a humane approach to drugs that reduces the role of criminalization and increases access to health based treatment and harm reduction services for people who need them.\\nWe look forward to a future where drug policies are shaped by science and compassion rather than political hysteria.\\nLearn about DPA\\'s victories in marijuana reform, criminal justice reform, and harm reduction.',\n",

North America held a dominant position in the global generic drugs market in 2016. This is attributed to favorable regulatory policies that are revised and amended to encourage generic drugs business in the region. For instance, Generic Drug User Fee Amendment (GDFUA) was reauthorized in 2017 after its initiation in 2012 by FDA for increasing consumer access to high quality, safe, and affordable drugs. On the other hand, Asia Pacific is expected to show a significant traction in the market over the forecast period. This is attributed to lower manufacturing costs and high skilled workforce in the Asian countries. According to India Brand Equity Foundation, India has the second largest number of U.S. FDA manufacturing plants outside the U.S. that are involved in generic drugs manufacturing. Additionally, the cost of manufacturing is 33% lower in India than that in the U.S., increasing accessibility to generics in these countries.Ask for detailed Sample of the Research Report: https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/insight/request-sample/1132 New drug launches and market approvals from the U.S. FDA to generic manufacturers are bolstering growth of the generic drugs market. For instance, in December 2017, Zydus Phamaceuticals — a subsidiary of Cadila Healthcare — received U.S. FDA approval to market Pramipexole Dihydrochloride extended-release tablets for the treatment of Parkinson ’s disease in the U.S. market. Key players operating in the global generic drugs market are Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Mylan N.V., Novartis International AG, Pfizer, Inc., Allergan Plc, Sun Pharmaceuticals, Fresenius Kabi, Sanofi, Endo International, Lupin Ltd., Abbott Healthcare, AstraZeneca Plc, and Novo Nordisk.Generic drugs refers to medication that have the same active ingredient as that of a branded drugs. These drugs also yield the same therapeutic effect and are prescribed in the same dosing, with the same quality, and same the way of consumption and usage. However, the inactive ingredients of generic drugs can differ as compared to their branded counter parts. These drugs are mainly marketed after a patent expiry of a branded drug and are significantly lower in costs as compared to the patented branded drugs. Generic drugs are of equivalent quality as compared to the branded drugs and are manufactured under the same safety and manufacturing procedures. Various manufacturers submit an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) to the FDA after the completion of period of patent exclusivity.Manufacturers of generic drugs are focusing on development and introduction of various innovative medication and formulation such as biosimilars. According to IMS Health data, generic drugs accounted for over 80% of the prescriptions dispensed in the U.S. in 2013. The number of patents expiring in the near future serves to be a major driver for growth of generic drugs market. For instance, Cetuximab (Erbitux) is an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor that is indicated in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and head and neck cancer. It is manufactured under the patent by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Eli Lily Company in Europe. The drug’s patent expires in 2018 and thus, is expected to provide opportunity for a large number of market players to manufacture its generic version. Furthermore, supportive initiative by FDA to promote development of biosimilars is encouraging manufacturers to focus towards its development. For instance, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act in the U.S. gr ants 12 months patent exclusivity with higher profit margins to the first manufacturer than the conventional generic manufacturers bringing the drugs in market later. Various other factors contributing to growth of generic drugs market include rampant growth in incidence of chronic diseases. However, shortage of active pharmaceutical ingredients leading to unavailability of generics in the market and increasing FDA pressure on manufacturers regarding manufacturing quality of these drugs are hindering the market growthTo get detailed table of content @ https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/ongoing-insight/toc/1132 The global generic drugs market is segmented on the basis of drug type, therapeutic application, route of administration, and region.On the basis of Drug Type, the global generic drugs market is segmented into: Monoclonal Antibodies, Cytokines, Vaccines, Insulin, Peptide Hormones, Immunoglobulin, Peptide Antibiotics, Blood Factors, Others,.On the basis of Therapeutic Application, the global generic drugs market is segmented into: Oncology, Cardiovascular Diseases, Neurology, Infectious Diseases, Musculoskeletal Diseases, Others,.Based on Route of Administration, the global generic drugs market is segmented into: Oral, Topical, Injectable, Intra-venous, Others,.',\n",
       " 'Ebola is no longer an incurable disease after successful trials of two new drug candidates which significantly improved the chances of survival for infected patients.\\nThe drugs have been rapidly advanced through clinical trials. This has been aided in part because of the ability to test them on patients in the middle of the ongoing Ebola outbreak in eastern DR Congo which was declared an international public health crisis last month. The outbreak has since spread across to a border town in Uganda.\\nProf. Jean-Jacques Muyembe, director general of DR Congo’s National Institute for Biomedical Research noted the findings of the study “will help save thousands of lives”. The institute led by Muyembe oversaw the clinical trial which he described as instrumental in redefining of Ebola. “From now on, we will no longer say that Ebola is incurable,” he says.\\nREUTERS/Baz Ratner Congolese government’s Ebola response coordinator Jean-Jacques Muyembe\\nPharmaceutical companies say they can make enough doses to treat all patients infected with Ebola while public health experts say the existence of a new drug will help temper public fears of the disease which has negatively impacted efforts to manage outbreaks.\\nAs of Aug. 6, a total of 2,781 cases have been reported, according to WHO. Of the total, 1,866 patients died—an overall case fatality ratio 67%.\\nThe US government’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) announced that two out of four candidate Ebola drugs proved effective: an antibody cocktail called REGN-EB3 developed by Regeneron and a monoclonal antibody called mAb114. Both now be offered to all infected patients after recording the lowest mortality rate among patients that were given REGN-EB3 (29%) and mAb114 (34%).\\nAmong individuals that came to the treatment center right after they fell ill, the results were more profound with mortality rates falling to 6% for REGN-EB3.\\nWHO said the drugs that showed the best results are are “the only drugs that future patients will be treated with”. “We will continue to conduct rigorous research and incorporate findings into the Ebola outbreak response through a variety of prevention and control strategies,” WHO stated.\\nWhile the various health policymakers involved in the prevention and control of Ebola have expressed interest in deploying the drugs in combating the disease outbreaks, it is worth noting the findings are yet to be published in scientific journals. NIAID said final analysis of the data has not been done and is expected to be completed in October 2019. The implication of this, according to Fauci, is that the final figures might change.\\nThe current Ebola outbreak is the second largest in history after the West African outbreak which peaked between 2013 to 2014 and claimed more than 11,300 lives in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.\\nDR Congo itself has had nine Ebola outbreaks over the last four decades but has often been able to keep the spread of viral disease under relative control. However, this outbreak in the troubled eastern region of the central African country has been aided by the restricted movement of health professionals due to conflict between armed militia, this has also led to a mistrust of health workers by people in the region. This month marks the second anniversary of this outbreak.\\nSign up to the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief here for news and analysis on African business, tech and innovation in your inbox',\n",

       " 'Emmanuel Kafe\\nFeatures Reporter\\nWHETHER it’s desperate times calling for desperate measures, or it is a question of ignorance on the part of consumers, dangerous developments are happening in the pharmaceutical industry.\\nMost medicines, whether prescriptions or over-the-counter, have expiry dates.\\nBefore this date, the manufacturer guarantees the user of full potency and effectiveness.\\nWhen the product expires, it means it has come to the end of its shelf life. It ceases to be effective.\\nBut for one reason or another, some pharmacies and members of the public are disregarding these expiry dates.\\nPharmacists who spoke on condition of anonymity to The Sunday Mail Society said some medicines currently on sale are long past their shelf life.\\nThey claim to have vast knowledge on the medicines, adding that their action is in the “best interests of consumers”.\\n“Yes, drugs have expiry dates but we use discretion. Some of the drugs do not lose potency two or three years after their expiration dates, hence we keep selling them,” revealed one pharmacist.\\n“It does not make business sense to dispose the expired drugs when they can still be used by our clients. Things are tough. It is now difficult to restock because of foreign currency shortages, hence the need to maximise on profits,” said another pharmacist.\\nDrugs are now priced beyond the reach of many, while other dealers are even demanding foreign currency, which is not readily available to most consumers.\\nWhile some people might have consumed expired drugs because of not applying due diligence — checking expiry dates — others are willing accomplices.\\nMildred Mapuranga, a Mabvuku resident said, “I suffer from arthritis and regularly need heavy painkillers. Sadly the drug prices have sky rocketed and I can hardly afford them. I was lucky to discover a pharmacy that is now selling me the painkillers at a much discounted price.\\n“I was told the drugs expired two or so months back but they are still efficient. I was sceptical at first but later realised that the medication is still providing the relief I need,” narrated Mapuranga.\\nThen there are those who end up consuming out of date drugs because of their hoarding tendencies.\\nDispensaries usually do not limit no-prescription drugs to clients.\\nDue to the prevailing economic squeeze, some people source drugs from different benefactors and end up with more than what they need. Therefore some of the drugs expire before they can be consumed.\\nThis is the predicament that Gogo Eunice Maramba finds herself in.\\nShe has a whole year’s stock of tablets for her medical condition.\\nSadly, some of the medication is now 10 or so months past expiration.\\nPermanent Secretary in the Ministry of Health and Child Care, Dr Agnes Mahomva said Government does not allow dispensing of expired drugs to patients.\\n“Those involved should stop giving out drugs that have outlived their shelf life because they are putting the lives of many people in danger.\\n“Drugs should first be analysed by the Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe (MCAZ) before they are given to patients. When any drug has passed the marked expiry date, it should be avoided,” said Dr Mahomva.\\nThe Government official further urged the public to report such practices to the police or relevant authorities.\\nMCAZ projects and public relations officer Mr Shingai Gwatidzo said their organisation conducts regular inspections in pharmacies to ensure adherence to regulations.\\n“Any extension of expiry must be approved by the authority after conducting due diligence on the quality and safety profile of the medicines. Without that approval, members of the public are advised that the safety and quality of such medicines is not guaranteed,” said Mr Gwatidzo.\\nSection 51 of the Medicines and Allied Substances Control General Regulations Statutory Instrument 150 of 1991 prohibits the sale of expired medicines.\\nIn trying to understand the effects of expired drugs, The Sunday Mail Society spoke to various health professionals.\\nProfessor Ishmail Muradzikwa, a part time clinical studies lecturer at a local university who is a pharmacist by profession, said not all drugs retain their potency after the expiry date.\\n“A lot of drugs are safe to use and are effective even 10 years after their expiry date. However, I would not advise people to consume them as some tend to become poisonous after passing their shelf life,” said Prof Muradzikwa.\\n“Expiry dates are there for a reason and should be respected. This is particularly important for vulnerable populations like children or the elderly, or those with chronic or serious conditions. If your medicine has expired, dispose of it and do so safely,” he said.\\nDr George Nyarangwa, a pharmacologist, is totally against the idea of consuming expired medicines.\\n“Medicines that have outlived their shelf life can be less effective or risky due to a change in chemical composition or a decrease in strength. Certain expired medications are at risk of bacterial growth. Sub-potent antibiotics can fail to treat infections, leading to more serious illnesses and antibiotic resistance,” explained Dr Nyarangwa. He said the new pharmacies mushrooming around town are usually behind such practices.\\n“These sprouting pharmacies are lining their pockets at the expense of consumers, putting their lives at risk,” he said.\\nOther health experts say a slight loss of potency in an antibiotic can negatively impact recovery as the drug may not reach the optimum healing levels required to eliminate bacterial infections.\\nThis in turn will lead to drug resistant diseases and health complications.\\nA report by Harvard Health Publications (2015), conducted by the US Food and Drug Administration found that almost 90 percent of more than 100 drugs are safe for use and effective even 15 years after the expiry date.\\nBut such researches create more questions than answers.\\nAre expiry dates a ploy by manufactures to stay in business by forcing consumers to periodically replenish their stocks?\\nShare your thoughts on [email protected]',\n",

       " \"Drugs fuel school violence\\nSubstance abuse is leading to chaotic behaviour at schools, including ill-discipline, aggressiveness, hostility, disrespect and vandalism.\\nANTI-DRUGS: A group from the Council of Churches in Namibia pictured during the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking last year. Photo: FILE\\nEducation and social experts say the cumulative impact of widespread social troubles, including the explosive rate of violence and substance abuse in Namibia, are the primary causes for the worrying upsurge of violence in schools.\\nVeronica Theron, a leading social worker and special advisor to First Lady Monica Geingos, told Namibian Sun this week: “Substance abuse in schools has reached endemic proportions, even during school hours, the use and dealing of drugs on the premises is a common trend.”\\nShe said both boys and girls are falling prey.\\nSanet Steenkamp, permanent secretary at the education ministry said: “The ministry has noticed with concern a growing number of reports around organised violence cases recorded at schools, particularly the Khomas Region.”\\nShe argued the problem is not isolated to the central region.\\n“I must stress that although the Khomas cases are publicised, organised violence and weapon use at schools are certainly not restricted to the said region.”\\nIn March 2017, a police raid at the JA Nel Secondary School led two drug possession related charges against a grade 9 and grade 10 learner, as well as the confiscation of knives, sharpened mirror pieces, and broken bottlenecks.\\nIn March this year, a grade 11 learner at Windhoek High School attacked and stabbed the school's principal.\\nAlso in March this year, a police raid at the Ella du Plessis Secondary School in Windhoek resulted in more than 40 learners being ordered to leave the premises, after police discovered knives, screwdrivers and broken mirror pieces, plus alcohol, in their possession.\\nProblems everywhere\\nSteenkamp said relentless reports on the topic across Namibia show the country is in the grip of a plague of violence, in “our homes, public spaces, and communities”.\\nShe said what happens outside of school is reflected on school grounds.\\n“There are many reasons for violence in schools, which include violence at home, society or communities, which is being perpetuated at a school level.”\\nSteenkamp noted that “violence doesn't occur in a vacuum. It's often the result of a systematic wearing down of communities, families, and individuals in adverse circumstances”.\\nShe said it is critical to understand, and address, the underlying causes that lead to the high rates of violence and behavioural issues in society.\\nOn a broad societal level, violence is linked to economic insecurity, trauma, racism, misogyny, social disconnection, access to deadly weapons and substance abuse, she said.\\nSteenkamp explained that learners involved in violent incidents may simply be seeking “attention or are involved with issues beyond their coping abilities”.\\nWindhoek Gymnasium principal Collette Rieckert said Namibia should be concerned, adding the abuse of substances is an undeniable problem “amongst our youth”.\\nShe said another factor that leads to behavioural problems is instability at home, and often the absence of a parent, specifically fathers.\\nRieckert underlined that substance abuse can be linked to “lack of hope, lack of self-worth, and a lack of parental love, in most cases”.\\nThe bully factor\\nKhomas education director Gerard Vries agreed that violent acts by learners often start at home, or are based on societal problems, and often involve bullying.\\nRecent eruptions of violence at Khomas schools were “isolated incidents and not gangsterism”, Vries added.\\nHe further explained that investigations found violence is often related to “older boys defending younger boys from bullying”.\\nSteenkamp described bullying as a form of violence against an individual or a group, which can lead to “gang fights”.\\n“In most cases, violence at schools does have an element of bullying to them.”\\nBullying is dehumanising, intimidating, hostile, humiliating and evokes fear of physical harm or emotional distress, she said and “affects a learner's ability to participate in or benefit from the school's education programmes or activities”.\\nWhat do we do?\\nSelf-esteem and knowing their own worth are key attributes that help students refrain from destructive behaviours, Gymnasium's Rieckert said.\\n“If one has a sense of self-worth and value, you will not just break down and damage everything and every person around you. Then you will appreciate your gift of life, and rather help others to see and experience the same.”\\nShe said the school has not struggled with a high rate of violent or substance abuse, in part because “we try to handle the problem before it starts”.\\nReligious programmes and counselling at school, plus on-campus nurses, are engaged as soon as “we see red lights”.\\nTheron pointed out that a big challenge is the lack of rehabilitation centres, specifically for youth in Namibia.\\nThe existing centres have a limited capacity and can only treat so many patients per year.\\nAnother issue is the close proximity of schools and hostels to shebeens, which allow easy access to alcohol and drugs.\\nSubstance abuse leads to chaotic behaviour at schools, Theron said, including ill-discipline, aggressiveness, hostility, disrespect, vandalism.\\n“These learners might pose a threat to others and more physical violence is reported. Learners living outside provide drugs to learners in hostels.”\\nSteenkamp noted that behavioural issues have been present at schools for many years, and in line with this, policies and procedures exist to address these issues.\\nMoreover, curricula taught at schools include elements of finding alternatives to violence, including peaceful conflict resolution and positive interpersonal relationship skills.\\nShe called on all stakeholders, including management, teachers, parents and the community, to ensure that school safety is enforced at schools.\\n“The ministry reiterates that schools should be places of safety where parents and guardians entrust their children's education to the care of teachers.”\\nSeveral schools and institutions recently pledged to join authorities in addressing school violence and joined a campaign spearheaded by the Office of the First Lady, the #BreakFree anti-violence campaign.\\nThe yearlong campaign is based on a nationwide call for action to address issues such as non-violent conflict resolution, sexual consent, problem solving and providing solutions to the high levels of violence in our society.\\nJANA-MARI SMITH & JEMIMA BEUKES\",\n",

       " 'The Supreme Court on Friday ordered the federal and provincial governments to form a National Action Plan to curb the menace of drug abuse in the country.A three-member bench, headed by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar, was hearing a suo motu case pertaining to selling of drugs at educational institutions.The apex court directed the Ministry of Information to start a public service campaign against use of drugs, particularly at educational institutions.The top judge said he was informed about young girls using drugs. “The issue affects millions,” he remarked.Justice Ijazul Ahsan observed that drug abuse was “eating away the youth”.The court ordered all chief secretaries, head of narcotics division and federal minister concerned to hold a meeting and suggest recommendations for a NAP within a week to curb the menace of drugs.The bench expressed dissatisfaction over the performance of the federal and provincial governments in this matter. The court noted that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf was ruling in three provinces, but had not taken any step to curb this menace.Following the court’s order of December 26, 2018 regarding establishment of a rehabilitation centre for drug addicts, Additional Advocate General Punjab Chaudhry Faisal Hussain submitted a report stating that the treatment centre at the Punjab Institute of Mental Health could not be made operational due to the stay order on the recruitment process of 241 new posts by the Lahore High Court since March last year.“The Punjab government has created new posts through schedule of new expenditure on February 19, 2018 and conducted interviews of all candidates who applied for the posts by March 26, 2018. However the recruitment process was stayed by the LHC on March 26, 2018. It assured that upon adjudication of the writ petition by the LHC, the recruitment process will be finalised without any loss of time so as to make the treatment centre at the Punjab Institute of Mental Health Lahore operational at the earliest,” says the report submitted by the AAG on behalf of the Punjab chief secretary about actions taken by the provincial government to curb the menace of drugs.The report reveals that since 2012, a total of 7,377 patients suffering from drug addiction were treated as indoor patients whereas 40,577 such patients were extended treatment as outdoor patients.Likewise, during five years a total number of 118,245 offenders addicted to various kinds of drugs were imprisoned in Punjab.Of these, 109,409 were treated as outdoor patients in prison hospitals whereas 32,227 were admitted to prison hospitals in dedicated wards/ beds and detoxified.The construction of a 20-bed unit for treatment of drug addicts at Central jail Lahore is underway at a total cost Rs24.983 million, says the report.It is also submitted that as per Section 54 of the Control of Narcotics and Substances Act 1997, the federal government is empowered to constitute a fund to be called the National Fund for Control of Drug Abuses.Likewise, AAG Hussain submitted a report about the outcome of the meeting chaired by Punjab Chief Secretary Yousaf Nasem Khokhar to discuss the anti-narcotics measures taken by the educational institutions in the province of Punjab.During the meeting, the minister for school education department informed that reportedly drug tendencies are predominantly rampant amongst the students of private schools and suggested random blood testing of students. However, chief secretary recommended to get a legal opinion from the law secretary in this context prior to proceeding further in the matter.Meanwhile, according to the Punjab police report, at least 466 arrests were made in the matter.',\n",

       " 'Brands vs generic drugs\\nJANELLE DE SOUZA looks at the debate between generic and brand prescriptions in TT.\\nMEDICAL professionals need to understand that people cannot afford expensive, brand-name drugs in this economy, and unless there is hard, solid evidence that it does not work, they should prescribe the generic version of the drug.\\nThat was the opinion of Jameel Rahaman, a pharmacist for over three decades.\\n“The patient is the one who is suffering. It is a lack of education, no transparency, and there is no truth. The pharmaceutical market is one huge racket.”\\nHe said Panadol and Tylenol, were different brands but they were the same drug as paracetamol and acetaminophen. The brands, he said, were about five times more expensive but they were all just as effective.\\nOne of the main reasons for this, he said, was because doctors were trained by, supported by, and given the most research materials by brand name pharmaceutical companies. He said doctors were invited to workshops and conferences on their drugs and they were accustomed to brand name drugs in their training so that was what they prescribed.\\nHe said brand name pharmaceutical companies could afford to research and market drugs, and had drug representatives that visited doctors to tout their wares, but generic companies could not afford such.\\nRahaman said he understood there was the misconception that generic drugs were not good. He said, in “the old days,” TT used to buy a lot of poor quality generic drugs from India so the conception that drugs from India were cheap and so not good, and inferior, lingered.\\n“It’s not so now because those companies have upgraded their regulations to that of the FDA in the States, Europe, Australia, etc. But it is branded in our psyche to believe if it is cheap or from India, it is no good. That is a hurdle to be overcome because when someone believes a drug can’t work, that is called the ‘nocebo’ effect – you’re putting into the person’s mind that it won’t work so it wouldn’t.”\\nHe went on to say that because of genomics, brand name and generic drugs alike only worked for some people. “Brand names are just as susceptible to not working as generics because everything depends on the individual patient’s metabolic make-up. Each person reacts differently to each different drug whether it’s brand or generic. ”\\nHe gave the example of the blood thinner Xarelto. He said it was a very expensive drug but 40 per cent of Caribbean and Asian people did not have the genetic make up to break it down so that it could be absorbed in the body.\\nHe further explained that the pharmaceutical industry was controlled by the brand-name companies based mostly in the United States and Europe, as well as by the insurance companies which controlled the research and pricing.\\n“When generics came on the market it caused a huge upheaval. The brand-name companies had so much money they forced the food and drug agencies around the would to make the standards even higher with respect to the purity of the compounds before they could even be brought to market. Therefore some generics are of a higher quality than the brands.” He said when they realised generic drugs could put them out of business, brand-name companies started buying up the generic companies. Those they could not buy, they hired to produce the drugs.\\nAs a result, three or four biggest generic manufacturers in India made most of the world’s brand name drugs.\\nHe said they bought the best materials, produced the highest quality drugs, and it cost less to produce because of mass production and very cheep labour.\\nHowever, Rahaman said many people equated gene rics with counterfeit drugs. He explained that generic medicines were medical drugs with names decided on by an expert committee. It has an active ingredient that is used for a medical effect and can be the same chemical purity as the brands.\\nCounterfeit medicine could be wrongly labelled as something it is not. It could be contaminated, contain the wrong or no active ingredient, or the percentage strength of the active ingredient is not within the acceptable dosage range.\\n“So, counterfeit medicine is fake medicine and it is very difficult to tell the difference by appearance.”\\nHe said globally, the counterfeit trade was bigger than the arms trade. Rahaman warned that these drugs could also be found in pharmacies if they were bought from suitcase traders or another disreputable sources.\\nUnfortunately, he said TT has no drug testing capabilities. He said the government “refused” to give CARIRI the money to get the lab going to test drugs so “we can’t even tell if the drug contains the ingredient it’s supposed to contain.”\\nRead part two in tomorrow’s paper',\n",

But it’s a long way from being a reality. Even if the plan does pan out, it will likely be years before regulators review, approve, and scale up efforts to import drugs.\\nStill, Canadians are infuriated by the idea and already brainstorming ways to toss it down the garburator, according to a report by health-news outlet STAT.

Prof. Attaran went on to refer to the plan as “deplorable” and “atrociously unethical.” “Our drugs are not for you, period.”\\nUnder the Trump administration’s plan, individual states would come up with their own frameworks to safely import drugs and then submit the plans to the federal government for approval. The administration also plans to allow manufacturers to import foreign versions of drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration and sell them at lower costs, as Kaiser Health News points out.\\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar—who once called the idea of importing drugs from Canada a “gimmick”—said the federal government is now “open for business” on the idea of importing Canadian drugs. In the past, the HHS, FDA, and US drug companies have argued that there was no way to ensure the safety and efficacy of imported drugs. But by the time the administration announced its import plan, Azar said his mind had been changed.\\nOn Monday, August 12, Canada’s Minister of Health Ginette Petitpas Taylor was set to meet with pharmacists, patients, and industry officials to discuss a response to the US plan, according to STAT. Petitpas Taylor has pledged to “ensure there are no adverse effects to the supply or cost of prescription drugs in Canada.”\\nIn order to protect Canadians, some advocates and policy experts suggested that Canada could begin controlling the export of pharmaceuticals, pass new laws simply banning exporting drugs meant for Canadians, or impose new tariffs.',\n",

       " \"Illustration : Angelica Alzona ( Gizmodo )\\nIf you’re looking to make your brain work better, you have plenty of options. You can start sleeping better, invest in a juicer, spend time at a decent gym. Or—if you’re pressed for time—you can pop a bunch of pills. Amphetamine, in the form of Adderall, has been wiring people for years, as have Ritalin and newer drugs like Vyvanse and Provigil, each with their own special set of side effects. All of these drugs require a prescription, which does somewhat limit access to them. But in recent years, fueled by the fervor of enhancement-obsessed online communities and an economic arrangement that incentivizes a perma-primed brain, a whole new class of nootropics has come to wider attention: some of these nootropics, like the class of drugs known as racetams, can be bought in many gas stations. The question hanging over all of these drugs—prescribed and over-the-counter—is: do they actually work? And if they do work, what (and who) do they work for? For this week’s Giz Asks, we’ve reached out to a number of experts to find out.\\nAdvertisement\\nSenior Lecturer in Transdisciplinary Innovation at University of Technology Sydney and Honorary Fellow in Philosophy at Macquarie University\\nSmart drugs work, and many people use them. I do not mean the ones you purchase from an online store that claims to be based in Silicon Valley, with cringe-worthy names like Startup HD or Turbo Snort. Don’t waste your money. Forget the fake “nootropic stacks,” the phenylpiracetams, and other pretenders which carry labels with words like “nootropic,” “cognitive enhancement,” “smart drug,” and so on. There is little or no good evidence that any of those products work. They are money-making schemes. No solid, replicated scientific studies support their claims. When I say that smart drugs work, I’m talking about the real deal: modafinil, methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, and (somewhat less common) pseudoephedrine, as well as (rather annoyingly) paracetamol, codeine, and a range of other medications we typically think of as treatments for diseases and disorders. But there is one critically important thing to remember: There is no medication that, when taken, will make you smart. What makes so-called “smart drugs” smart drugs is what they enable people to do. Roughly, smart drugs are substances which, when used, enable us to do valuable things which we otherwise wouldn’t have been able to do. In particular, what people seem most interested in, when they speak of smart drugs, are things like the ability to stay awake and sharp and focused for longer, or to work faster and more efficiently. When the ability to do those things is viewed as a marker of smartness—or when using that ability leads to the acquisition of things or qualities that are viewed as markers of smartness—then we call those medications “smart drugs.” Among the more commonly used central nervous system stimulants are methylphenidate (aka Ritalin), dextroamphetamine (which, combined with levoamphetamine, goes by the brand name Adderall), lisdexamfetamine (aka Vyvanse), and modafinil (aka Provigil, though generics include Modalert, Modavigil, Alertec and others). These CNS stimulants can all indeed be classified as smart drugs. They work, in the sense that they can enable people to do some of the things described above. But is doing those things valuable? In the decade that I have worked on the topic of cognitive enhancement, there has been a very prominent rise in the public’s interest in, knowledge of, and use of smart drugs. We are at a point in human history when we are seldom disconnected from other people, and hence from their demands on our time. And the fact that many of us can work from anywhere, at any time we like, just means that we end up working everywhere, all of the time. We all compete for jobs and/or contracts and/or scholarships and/or graduate places in college, not just with others in our area with similar skill-sets but, potentially with everyone on the entire planet looking for similar opportunities. Within this new context, who couldn’t benefit from smart drugs’ effects? We can only expect this trend in the increased interest in and use of CNS stimulant medications to grow. After all, whether through natural scarcity or because modern states operate as capitalist market economies, we all live in interconnected competitive societies, and thus we probably all can benefit from having an advantage over others. What’s more, we know that at least some of our colleagues and potential competitors are using these medications to obtain an advantage. This is the stark reality of how a particular group of medications have come to be known as “smart drugs.” Because meritocratic (or, if you prefer, competitive) societies have weaponized our very bodies, brains, and precious hours of our lives. We need more time in the day to be available for work, and we need to have the ability to make better use of the precious little time we do have, if we are to remain competitive and survive. I’ll leave it up to you to decide if this really does mean that they should be thought of as smart drugs. My second point is that if you agree that what makes something a genuine smart drug is whether it enables you to do the sorts of things I mentioned above—e.g. stay awake for longer, remain alert, enjoy your work so you have a positive reason to keep doing it, as well as ignore distractions for the very same reason, and memorize and recall things better—I honestly do not understand why a range of other medications and non-medications are also not on this list. We have all become such habitual smart drug users that when we are asked to find them, we do not notice what’s there right in front of our noses, and we spend our time searching for something more novel, preferably with the words “nootropics” or “cognitive enhancer” or “smart drugs” emblazoned on the pill containers or blister packet. However, those are not the drugs you’re looking for. If it says “nootropic” on the packet, it is probably a money-making scam. The ones you want, you’re probably already using, and I suspect quite heavily (caffeine, for instance). The ones you’re not yet using, though, because they are illegal to obtain without a doctor’s prescription, or because they have a scary medical side effect profile, are another matter. If you think you might have ADHD, invest the time to learn about the condition, its symptoms, potential treatments, and their potential effects and side effects. Then, go see the best psychiatrist you can find, and together with them figure out if you really do have a condition called ADHD, and thus whether you really might benefit from treatment with the otherwise-illicit medications. You may, of course, find out that you are actually already functioning at your peak, and that you would not benefit from these meds. Alternatively, you may discover that if you treat your environment (e.g. your workplace, or school) as a constant, then in that environment you will indeed appear to be dysfunctional and to adjust to that environment you will need a diagnosis of ADHD and a prescription for the relevant medications. The open question for me, however, is whether you’d be better off getting yourself out of those environments that require you to drug yourself to function within them, or whether those environments are so valuable that drugging yourself is worth the price of staying put within them.\\nAdvertisement\\n“Forget the fake ‘nootropic stacks,’ the phenylpiracetams, and other pretenders which carry labels with words like ‘nootropic,’ ‘cognitive enhancement,’ ‘smart drug,’ and so on. There is little or no good evidence that any of those products work. They are money-making schemes. No solid, replicated scientific studies support their claims.”\\nAssistant Professor, Philosophy and Religious Studies, North Carolina State University, and the author of Neuroethics, Justice and Autonomy: Public Reason in the Cognitive Enhancement Debate\\nDrugs like methylphenidate (Ritalin), modafinil (Provigil) and amphetamine (Adderall) do work, in the sense that they’re FDA-approved treatments which help specific populations. But whether they work for people who are fully rested and who want a boost at work or on test scores—they most certainly do not. Modafinil, for instance—which the military has begun prescribing to pilots in lieu of amphetamine, which can be dangerously addictive—does work for its intended purpose. Pilots, who might have commissions lasting 30 hours, are successfully kept awake by it. Anyone who is tired and takes a tablet of modafinil will be able to work longer, with fewer mistakes and fewer effects of fatigue. More work gets done, certainly. But modafinil has not made anyone smarter, or improved anyone’s baseline performance. Amphetamine is approved for the treatment of ADHD, and since the 1990s has displaced methylphenidate as the main drug prescribed for this disorder. I believe this change has been driven by the subjective feelings of being better at doing something that amphetamine generates, as well as its addictive properties. I think we have an epidemic that is in the shadow of the opioid epidemic—specifically, student populations are increasingly addicted to stimulants. Though they might help a student cram for an exam, long-term use can be a very bad idea, and will actually reduce effectiveness. And there is a profound risk of addiction. As for over-the-counter nootropics, it’s very hard to generalize. The whole label is fraught with difficulties. The issue is that most of these are supplements, which means the FDA isn’t regulating them, as the FDA lost that battle in the 1990s. That means it’s difficult to say if any single supplement is doing anything, because what’s written on the label may not actually be what’s in there. We don’t know if these are actually working in any way, shape or form. The term “nootropic” implies that these are improving baseline performance, but I very much doubt that. They might help with maintenance, like coffee. But again, long-term use might lead to tolerance, and a situation where you need the substance to perform at your baseline.\\nWhat's the Best VPN? Read on The Inventory\\n“The issue is that most of these are supplements, which means the FDA isn’t regulating them... We don’t know if these are actually working in any way, shape or form.”\\nAssociate Professor, Medicine, Cambridge Health Alliance\\nIt’s important to understand that there are two routes that drugs appear on the US market. One pathway is after clinical studies have proven efficacy and safety followed by FDA approval. The second route is directly to consumers in supplements, no human testing required. When drugs are sold direct to consumers as supplements, the quantities on the label are often inaccurate. Worse, there is no need to perform studies in humans to demonstrate that the drug works or that it is safe before it’s available for sale. This leaves the consumer at the mercy of the supplement company. What we have found in our research is that brain enhancing supplements may contain active drugs at unpredictable doses. There is no way to ensure that the supplement contains what is listed on the label, nor that it is safe to consume, so I recommend avoiding all brain enhancement supplements until we can be assured that the bottles contain only what is listed on the label and there is some evidence of safety.\\nAdvertisement\\n“...brain enhancing supplements may contain active drugs at unpredictable doses. There is no way to ensure that the supplement contains what is listed on the label.”\\nTherapeutic Cognitive Neuroscience Professor, Professor of Neurology and Cognitive Science at the Johns Hopkins University and School of Medicine and the Editor-in-Chief of Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology\\nIf by “smart” is meant an actual increase in vigilance and/or intelligence, then over-the-counter so-called nootropics have never been reliably proven to work, nor is it very plausible that they really would work. Being “smart” is the result of a great many, finely-synchronized mental functions, which get orchestrated in different ways to tackle different mental challenges. And even relatively elemental mental functions don’t have a straightforward correspondence with the brain mechanisms that may be responsible for them. (To the extent such correspondences are somewhat known or suspected.) So even it were possible to tweak a specific brain mechanism, the overall system might not work any better, and might even work worse. Imagine as a rough analogy trying to speed up the CPU in a computer, without increasing the speed of memory access.\\nAdvertisement\\n“Being ‘smart’ is the result of a great many, finely-synchronized mental functions, which get orchestrated in different ways to tackle different mental challenges.”\\nProfessor of Neuroscience and Psychology at Yale University\\nIt is very hard to truly enhance cognition. Cognitive functioning requires an intricate and precise pattern of neural activity, usually involving the newly evolved prefrontal cortex. It is challenging to improve this process, and easy to mess it up. Over the counter “meds” like Prevagen are mostly BS to make money. Compounds such as Adderall and Ritalin can indeed help improve prefrontal function in many people if the dose is right. These medications increase the release of dopamine and norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex, which are essential to prefrontal function. The same can be said for caffeine, which leads to an increase in acetylcholine, a neuromodulator that is also necessary for prefrontal function. But too much caffeine or stimulant actually worsens function—the prefrontal cortex needs just the right amount of dopamine, norepinephrine and acetylcholine—too much impairs.\\nAdvertisement\\n“Too much caffeine or stimulant actually worsens function—the prefrontal cortex needs just the right amount of dopamine, norepinephrine and acetylcholine—too much impairs.”\\nDo you have a burning question for Giz Asks?

       " 'A few weeks ago, I posted my list of the five most influential psychiatric thinkers of all time : Emil Kraepelin, Sigmund Freud, Eugen Bleuler, Nathan S. Kline, and Aaron Beck. After some feedback on social media, I\\'ve decided to follow up that article with a list of the five most influential psychiatric drugs of all time.\\nSource: Public domain\\nThe birth of modern psychopharmacology dates back to the 1950s when a series of discoveries forever changed the course of psychiatry and the lives of millions of patients. The following drugs—although some no longer commonly used—changed the field in dramatic ways, opening up psychiatry to the treatment of disorders once considered untreatable. Their discoveries rank among the greatest achievements in the history of medicine.\\n1. Lithium Carbonate\\nLithium salts have been used to alleviate psychological distress since the Roman days. Roman physicians would send their nervous and temperamental patients to bathe in bath springs in southern and western Europe. We now know that these particular springs have the highest natural concentrations of lithium on the European continent.\\nThe modern discovery of lithium as a treatment for bipolar disorder was made in 1948 by John Cade, an Australian psychiatrist who selected lithium because it would neutralize uric acid, which he believed at the time to be the cause of mania. As it turned out, bipolar disorder has nothing to do with uric acid, but lithium worked magically to calm manic patients. As such, it became the first specific drug to target a particular psychiatric disorder. More than seventy years after its discovery, lithium remains the most effective medication in all of psychiatry, with a response rate of more than 70% for patients with bipolar disorder. It also has useful applications in the treatment of unipolar depressions.\\nAfter its original discovery in Australia, lithium carbonate was brought to America by the psychiatrist Ronald Fieve, who was influential in opening the first lithium clinic in the U.S. at Columbia University in the early 1960s. Despite lithium\\'s well-established efficacy, there is broad agreement that the drug is now underprescribed in favor of the newer, more profitable mood stabilizers and antipsychotics.\\nNonetheless, lithium\\'s discovery as an effective treatment for bipolar disorder ushered in the psychopharmacological revolution in psychiatry. For the first time in history, something could be done to treat serious mental disease.\\n2. Thorazine\\nLithium\\'s serendipitous discovery in 1948 was followed shortly thereafter by another miraculous discovery: the world\\'s first antipsychotic drug. In 1949, a French military surgeon in Tunisia named Henri Laborit was seeking a way to reduce surgical shock. He investigated one antihistamine, chlorpromazine, which he found to have profound psychological effects on patients when given prior to surgery. Intrigued, Laborit convinced a psychiatrist colleague to ingest the drug to provide feedback on its psychotropic effects. In 1952, he convinced another psychiatrist to administer the drug to a schizophrenic patient for the first time.\\nChlorpromazine\\'s use as the first neuroleptic swept across Europe, but in the psychoanalytically-dominated U.S., its reception was muted. At the time, American psychiatrists were pursuing psychosocial explanations of schizophrenia, such as Gregory Bateson\\'s double-bind theory. Baffled, the pharmaceutical company that produced chlorpromazine (brand name Thorazine) began courting state governments, rather than psychiatrists and medical schools, insisting that the drug could be a cost-saver for state mental health programs.\\nSoon thereafter, almost every major U.S. psychiatric hospital began using the drug, and by 1964, more than 10,000 peer-reviewed papers had been published on Thorazine. The introduction of Thorazine in the U.S. eventually contributed to the broader deinstitutionalization movement, and the number of hospitalized patients decreased from roughly 600,000 in 1952 to 160,000 in 1977.\\nThorazine remains one of the most effective antipsychotic medications, particularly for patients with serious disease, and has useful applications in emergency settings. Along with lithium, it is listed on the World Health Organization\\'s List of Essential Medicines.\\n3. Imipramine\\nThe third of the landmark discoveries in early psychopharmacology was imipramine, the world\\'s first tricyclic antidepressant. Its discovery, like those many early psychopharmacological agents—including Thorazine and lithium—was serendipitous.\\nIn the early 1950s, drug companies were searching for new drugs to compete with Thorazine on the market for schizophrenia. Roland Kuhn, a Swiss psychiatrist hired by the pharmaceutical company Geigy, began investigating a single compound but found no significant antipsychotic effects. Geigy wanted Kuhn to select a new compound for investigation, but Kuhn, who was always more interested in depression than schizophrenia, did something remarkable: He decided to go behind the backs of the pharmaceutical company that was funding his research and administer this compound to depressed patients. What he found was nothing short of miraculous.\\nWithin a few weeks of initiation of imipramine, Kuhn\\'s chronically depressed patients began to regain a sense of purpose, motivation, and hope. Their depressive symptoms, once considered to be intractable, responded remarkably to this novel drug.\\nWith imipramine\\'s discovery, psychiatry finally had effective biological treatments for its three flagship disorders: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. For many years, imipramine was considered the \"gold standard\" in the treatment of major depression. While its regular use has been largely superseded by the newer SSRIs and SNRIs, it remains useful in the treatment of refractory and atypical depressions.\\n4. Valium\\nValium was invented by chemist Leo Sternbach at Hoffman-La Roche in New Jersey in 1963, the second benzodiazepine drug to be discovered, following Librium in 1960. Valium was a game-changer in psychiatry, becoming the top-selling pharmaceutical in the U.S. from 1969 to 1982. The introduction of the benzodiazepines marked a significant improvement over the older barbiturates, which were far more sedating and dangerous when an overdose occurred. Since Valium\\'s release, a number of derivative benzodiazepines have been developed, including, most notably, Xanax, introduced in 1981.\\nYet, Valium holds the distinction of being the groundbreaking benzodiazepine. While the use of the benzodiazepine class of drugs has become increasingly criticized due to their risk of physical dependence and withdrawal, they remain effective agents in the treatment of panic, anxiety, agitation, catatonia, and other conditions.\\n5. Prozac\\nIn the past 30 years, perhaps no psychiatric drug is more well-known than Prozac (fluoxetine), which was discovered by Eli Lilly and Company in 1970 and entered medical use in the U.S. in 1988. It was one of the very first SSRI drugs ever synthesized, its introduction was an event of momentous psychiatric and social-cultural importance. The discovery of the SSRI drugs represented a landmark achievement in psychiatry, and they are now, by far, the most widely prescribed medications for clinical depression, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and other ailments.\\nSince Prozac\\'s introduction, a number of \"me-too\" SSRIs have followed, each with a slightly different chemical structure and side effect profile but similar in their basic mechanism and effectiveness. The first drug of its kind to enter widespread use, Prozac represented more than a new trend in psychiatry; it changed the way we think about depression, psychiatric illness, and human psychology. Its broader effect was captured eloquently by psychiatrist Peter D. Kramer in his bestselling 1993 book Listening to Prozac.',\n",

       " \"by Tauriq Moosa\\nHow should we tackle things we believe are wrong and should be illegal, when it seems their very status of being ‘illegal’ gives rise to the problems we oppose. It’s not drugs per se that bothers us, but the violence and destruction that can arise. It’s not sex itself that’s a problem, it’s how we consider sex and apply it to policy decisions. But using our emotions and knee-jerk reactions and letting it simmer within policies can have disastrous effects for us.\\nI’ve written before that I don’t quite understand the so-called inherent moral problem of necrophilia. Sure, the deceased’s loved ones might be upset, offended and so on. But aside from these interests, what else should we be concerned about? Health reasons, you say? Well, that’s a problem even for living and consensual partners in sex acts, given STD’s, trust, promiscuity and so on. What makes necrophilia particularly a problem?\\nThe main thing about acts of necrophilia, it seems to me, is revulsion. What makes it particularly potent is the combination of ‘sex’ with death. Sex, for many people, is fraught with moral problems – but, as I’ve briefly highlighted above with necrophilia – it’s not particular to sex with dead bodies or sex with live bodies. Both are apparently problematic. It’s how people consider sex in general.\\nI don’t quite understand why sex should be considered morally problematic in itself. It is not. Just as driving a car is not problematic in itself: Sure, we can kill others and ourselves, and usually we have partners involved, but that doesn’t mean driving a car is automatically morally problematic. Sex offers pleasure and pain, like most of life. I think that many people are still caught up in absolute right and wrong ways to conduct themselves in and toward sex, instead of realising that like most human actions, sexual relations are dynamic and varied. The ways we approach sex more often has terrible consequences than the results of consensual sex between rational persons.\\nConsider recently a story in the M&G about prosecuting 12- to 16-year-olds engaged in consensual sex acts.\\nRecently, children's rights activists were outraged when it emerged that National Prosecution Authority head Menzi Simelane had used the Act to authorise the prosecution of at least two groups of children between the ages of 12 and 16 for having consensual sex — six learners from Mavalani High School in Limpopo and three pupils from Johannesburg.\\nSimelane did withdraw the charges, but compelled the children to complete something called a “diversion programme”. The problem is the Sexual Offences Act which “makes it illegal for any person to engage in ‘consensual sexual penetration’ with children between the ages of 12 and 16.” It has excellent justification of course: “This Act was designed to address the sexual abuse of children [my emphasis]” – but many of you will no doubt see the arising problem: “But in effect also makes it illegal for youngsters of those ages to have sex.”\\nRead more »\",\n",
       " 'Within hours of President Maithripala Sirisena’s announcement that he would commence a new phase in the fight against narcotic drugs, the able sleuths of anti-narcotics bureau of the police detected a huge amount of heroin and arrested suspects including two American nationals who masterminded an international drug mafia at a luxurious housing complex in the heart of Colombo. That alone is a proof of the utmost seriousness of the drug issue as President always stressed in no uncertain terms.\\nPresident Sirisena, in his speech at the launch of National Drug Eradication Week at the Vidyananda Vidyalaya, Mulliyawalai in Mullaithivu on January 21, vowed to carry out death penalty in respect of those who had been found guilty of narcotic offences and continue drug operations from the death cell in prison. On the following day the elite Special Task Force (STF) and the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB), in a joint operation arrested those five suspects, including two US passport holders and an Afghan national with over 100 kilos of heroin with a street value of approximately Rs. 600 million.\\nThe police pointed out that a foreigner had never been arrested in Sri Lanka for directly transferring heroin before. Initial investigations have revealed that the apartment, used by the Americans, had been rented by a Turkish couple for a period of two months. The police are looking for the Turkish couple.\\nDrug smugglers\\nLast month a 23-year old Bangladeshi woman was arrested by the Police Narcotic Bureau with 32 kgs of heroin valued at around Rs. 388 million in Ratmalana. The woman was identified as Surjo Moni and was produced in the Mount Lavinia Magistrate’s Court and remanded. Further investigations resulted in the arrest of five more Bangladeshis, including two women involved in drug smuggling in Sri Lanka. Bangladesh extended fullest cooperation to Sri Lanka to investigate into the drug smuggling and sent a team of officials to assist. Bangladesh High Commissioner in Sri Lanka, M Reaz Hamidullah said that his country always maintains a policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism and drugs. “It would extend all possible cooperation to Sri Lanka to investigate the drug smuggling,” he said.\\nPresident Sirisena, in his speech in Mullaithivu reiterated that he would not have any mercy on drug smugglers who are destroying the younger generation of the country. “We have many government institutes connected to this, but the smugglers somehow finds a way to bring in drugs into our country. You must have seen that in the recent times our officers were able to arrest drugs worth crores. In appreciation of their work we are going to honour them by presenting them with awards in January 28,” he said.\\nHe referred to the recent visit to the Philippines and said he gained some new ideas and knowledge about the drug eradication campaign. The Philippine was a country that was being gradually ruined due to the drug addiction among youth. President Rodrigo Duterte launched a massive campaign on a war footing to eradicate drug menace. In the campaign several thousands of drug smugglers were killed and there were strong criticism from the human rights groups regarding this ruthless campaign.\\nHowever, President Sirisena said while he was not going to do the things which have been done by the Philippines President, he would take stern action against culprits within the legal system. “Some NGO personnel who brag about the human rights always take the side of the drug smugglers. In Philippine, I told that Philippines President is an example for the presidents of the world. I happened to see that world human rights organisation had stated that Sri Lankan President discourages the human rights and one news paper highlighted that I should be punished at the Hague Court,” he pointed out.\\nHuman rights organisations\\nThe so-called champions of human rights who make big fuss, have no programme to make the country rescue from this catastrophe and in fact the drug traffickers are being sheltered by the human rights people, President Sirisena charged. “I am not here to give up this battle of drug eradication bowing down before human rights organisations. I dare human rights organisations to peel off their masks and extend their hands towards drug eradication movement to look after the children of this country.”\\nOn July 25, Cabinet approved a proposal to put convicted drug dealers who are on the death row to death if they continue to do indulge in drug trafficking. However, President Sirisena said in Mullaithivu that the files of convicted drug dealers have been withheld or disappeared from prisons, sabotaging his decision to activate death penalty on them.\\nThe Justice and Prison Reforms Ministry issued a time line on the process it adopted to implement the death penalty on death row prisoners on drug related crimes.\\nOn October 2, two out of 18 were confirmed for immediate implementation of death on October 3, the list of death row prisoners recommended for immediate implementation of death was sent by the Ministry. Another name of a death row prisoner was confirmed for death on October 13.\\nA discussion was held by President Sirisena with officials of the Ministry of Justice and Prison Reforms on the death row prisoners list. The Justice Ministry has sent another list of 48 death row prisoners who have been convicted on drug related crimes, while 30 out of them have filed appeals against the convictions.\\n“I have not changed my mind about the decision to give the drug traffickers the capital punishment. There are hundreds of drug traffickers in prison facing death penalty. I will not give up on this programme. Are you telling me to let go those smugglers who cause damage to children, country and the nation,” he asked.\\nIt will not be an easy decision to make to carry out capital punishment.\\nHowever, the leaders have to take tough decisions in the larger good of the people. It is the responsibility of the leaders to safeguard the people, especially the young generation vulnerable to illicit drugs.\\nOn this important issue, President Sirisena deserves the support of the whole nation to implement death penalty, at least for a brief period as a deterrent.',\n",
       " 'The U.S. has shipped over half a million doses of antibody treatments from Eli Lilly and Regeneron that have the potential to keep high-risk Covid patients out of hospitals.\\nTop health officials said the drugs are still being underutilized and urged hospitals to prescribe the drugs much more frequently.\\nDespite the difficulties that come with administering the drugs, hospitals should arrange infusion centers to administer the drugs that could help prevent strain on the health-care system, they said.\\n© Provided by CNBC In this May 2020 photo provided by Eli Lilly, researchers prepare mammalian cells to produce possible COVID-19 antibodies for testing in a laboratory in Indianapolis.\\nThe U.S. has shipped over half a million doses of antibody treatments that have the potential to keep high-risk Covid patients out of hospitals if given early enough in their infection.\\nThis would help already overburdened hospitals avoid additional strain, but the drugs are still being underutilized despite their promising results, Trump administration health officials said Thursday. That\\'s because many patients don\\'t know how to access them, and hospitals aren\\'t prescribing the medications or arranging the infusion sites necessary to administer the drugs, they said.\\n\"I want my colleagues to hear me,\" U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams told reporters. \"You need to think about and be willing to prescribe these medications much more frequently as a way to protect your patients, preserve your hospital capacity and to support your exhausted colleagues.\"\\nThe Food and Drug Administration in November issued emergency authorizations for antibody drugs from Eli Lilly and Regeneron. The latter\\'s drug was given to President Donald Trump, who said it made him feel better \"immediately\" when he was hospitalized with the coronavirus in October.\\nHowever, hospitals have listed a number of problems that come with prescribing the drugs. The treatments have the biggest benefit when delivered to someone early on in their infection. But Covid test results may be delayed and people might not seek care until they\\'re already displaying symptoms, diminishing the effectiveness of the antibody treatments.\\nThe drugs are also difficult to administer. Hospitals have to assemble infusion centers with dedicated staff to dispense them, but some patients may have a hard time getting to those sites, and providing the drugs at someone\\'s home is labor intensive. It can also take more than an hour to give them to people through an IV infusion and requires an additional hour of monitoring afterward.\\nDespite the difficulties, it\\'s still worthwhile for hospitals to build the infusion centers and prevent more people from falling seriously ill with the virus, said Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of FDA\\'s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. The treatments are helpful for people 65 years old or over or those with underlying health conditions, the FDA says.\\n\"Some of these may be unusual sites, not in hospitals but at other places, in order to take those high-risk people who have a high probability of getting hospitalized getting very sick, going into the ICU and so forth, to infuse them with antibodies as early as possible in the disease,\" Woodcock told reporters.\\nThe U.S. has doubled down on its efforts to use the treatments. The Department on Health and Human Services on Monday launched a \"treatment locator\" that allows health-care providers and patients to find potential locations to receive the antibody treatments. As of Jan. 6, more than 641,000 doses of the treatment courses had been administered but 75% remained unused, HHS said.\\nThe federal government said Tuesday it purchased more than 1.2 million additional treatment courses of the Regeneron drug that will be delivered in the first half of 2021. That brings its supply of both antibody drugs to nearly 5 million courses, if needed.\\nThe additional supply and the push from the Trump administration come as an average of 245,306 people test positive for Covid every day, according to a CNBC analysis of Johns Hopkins University data. There are more than 130,300 people hospitalized with Covid across the U.S., double the amount of patients since mid-November before the winter holiday season, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project, which is run by journalists at The Atlantic.\\n\"So we hope the changes that we\\'re making, better public awareness and better provider awareness, will drive more administration of these antibodies,\" Woodcock said.\\nCovid variants and efficacy\\nEarly trial studies have shown the antibody drugs decrease the viral load in patients, shortens symptoms and, most importantly, keeps people out of the hospital, Woodcock said.\\nHowever, some medical experts are concerned that there\\'s not enough evidence the drugs work. The Infectious Diseases Society of America has recommended against routine use of Eli Lilly\\'s treatment, citing a lack of data. And the National Institutes of Health, citing \"insufficient data,\" said the drug \"should not be considered the standard of care.\"\\nNew and more infectious variants of the coronavirus, especially a strain found in South Africa known as 501Y.V2, could be more resistant to monoclonal antibody treatments, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Tuesday. Unlike vaccines, which trigger an immune response that attacks different parts of the virus, monoclonal antibodies target a very specific component, Fauci told California Gov. Gavin Newsom in late December.\\nWoodcock said trials underway should give a better picture of how effective the drugs are, but there\\'s also \"real world\" evidence from health-care systems that have found the antibodies helpful. She added that researchers are \"actively looking\" to determine whether the new Covid mutations will have any impact on the treatments.\\n\"It is possible that any variant, some variant at some point, could escape neutralization by any of these antibodies,\" Woodcock said. \"That\\'s also why we\\'re aiming toward combinations, or so-called cocktails, of monoclonals, because it\\'s much less likely that any given variant would escape both of them at once.\"\\n— CNBC\\'s Will Feuer contributed to this report.',\n",

At the same time, there are a lot of tensions between Hindus and Muslims in India, and there is also increasing state-sanctioned Islamophobia and persecution of Muslims in India.\\nAll of this divides our editorship, as is evident from some of the more questionable \"keep\" and \"delete\" opinions, and makes it very difficult to assess consensus. There is no numerical consensus, and both sides make valid arguments: there is a lot of coverage, which contributes to notability, but there are also existing articles about both the religious movement and COVID-19 in India, which calls into question the need for yet another article.\\nIn my view, arguments based on notability criteria should not be given decisive weight in the context of this kind of topic. We have established notability criteria in order to distinguish unimportant topics such as run-of-the-mill garage bands or housing developments from important ones. But notability arguments fall short where all agree that the topic at issue is important, but that the question is how to best order and present the content.\\nIn this context, I believe that the arguments made here against creating another article are significantly more persuasive in the light of the purpose of Wikipedia, which is \"to create a high-quality, free-content encyclopedia in an atmosphere of camaraderie and mutual respect among contributors\". Both COVID-19 and the India/Pakistan topic area are highly volatile and rife with misinformation and tensions in the real world and on Wikipedia.\\nIt is beneficial to the project and our readers to limit the number of articles in which such topics are discussed, in order to force editors with different points of view to come to an agreement over how to neutrally address these issues, rather than to create forks that, if only because of their number, are difficult to keep consistent, neutral and free from misinformation that can have a disruptive impact on the real world. For these reasons, I am giving more weight to the \"delete\" opinions in this discussion.',\n",
       " 'The other case involving De Lima and Ronnie Dayan is more complicated, but nevertheless equally demolished in De Lima’s demurrer. The accusation here is that then-BuCor OIC Rafael Ragos personally delivered P10 million on two occasions to De Lima and Dayan as her share in the Bilibid drug trade. Instead, what the prosecution was able to prove, at best, was that the money came from various sources, none of them proven to be from drug trading, in exchange for prison favors for inmates. At the most, this is a case for bribery, not drugs, even if bribery on the part of De Lima is proven beyond reasonable doubt, which was not. But even this prosecution narrative was greatly undermined by the lack of connection between De Lima and the Bilibid inmates, because what was clearly proven by the DOJ’s own witnesses was that it was Ragos himself who admitted and was proven to have extorted from the Bilibid inmates in exchange for various favors.',\n",

Type 2 diabetes drug metformin - which may alter mood.\\nBut rather than test them in trials, the scientists went looking for evidence in the real world.\\nThey analysed life-long medical records of 142,691 people in Sweden who had schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or other severe mental illnesses.\\nThey then compared the number of times each was admitted to a psychiatric hospital clinic when they were taking those medications and when they were not.\\nDr Joseph Hayes, one of the researchers at UCL, said: \"The paper suggests a 10-20% reduction in the number of episodes when on the medications rather than off.\"\\nThe results, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, also showed a reduction in self-harm.\\n\"It\\'s incredibly exciting,\" Dr Hayes said.\\n\"It\\'s got enormous potential and I\\'m pleased with the way it has turned out.\\n\"But this is really just a starting point.\"\\nHe wants the drugs to now be tested in large clinical trials, which should give a final answer.\\nIn the meantime, Dr Hayes says people should not go out and try to get the drugs themselves.\\nBut, he says, there are many patients who should be on these drugs for their physical health who are not getting them.\\n\"The thing to do would be to see your GP about full physical health review,\" Dr Hayes said.\\n\"There\\'s a huge number of people that may benefit from a statin for their heart health and there\\'s a potential knock-on for their mental health, similarly with metformin.\"\\nDr James MacCabe, from the Institute of Psychiatry at King\\'s College London, said: \"These findings are very compelling.\\n\"The findings strongly suggest a potential role for repurposing these drugs to improve mental health outcomes.\"\\nBut there is one nagging doubt, even from the researchers, around the way the study was designed.\\nA lot of studies compare one group of patients taking a drug with another group not taking it.\\nThis one compared patients at different stages of their life when they were either on the drug or not.\\nThe approach has many advantages but it could mean that when people are in a good place mentally and less likely to be admitted to hospital, they are also more likely to look after themselves and take other medications.\\nIn other words, statins and other drugs could just be a red herring.\\nThis is why Prof Naveed Sattar, from University of Glasgow, remains sceptical and says: \"I would be strongly cautious with these findings and would only change my mind if effects are proven to be robust in a randomised trial.\"\\nThe research group took steps to counter this effect but agree clinical trials are the next step.\\nSource: BBC\\nrisingbd/Jan 10, 2018/Mukul',\n",

Refat was jailed in a drug case,” said human rights activist Md Hasanur Rahman Jhantu.\\nRefat Shorif was stabbed to death on a Barguna road on Jun 26 -- an incident that is still grabbing headlines as the plot behind the murder unravels.\\nA video of the gory incident showing Refat’s wife Aysha Siddika Minny desperately trying to save him but in vain went viral and sparked nationwide outrage. Minny, the key witness in the case, was later arrested for conspiring with the attackers.\\nPolice pointed to a conflict between Nayon and Refat over the former’s relationship with Minny as the motive for the murder. But the issue of drugs surfaced as bdnews24.com investigated.\\nNayon was named in eight cases and Rifat Forazi in four; most of these cases are related to drugs, said Barguna Police Station chief Abir Mohammed Hossain.\\nThe dead victim Refat was implicated in two drug-related cases – one of which even saw him jointly named with one of his attackers Rifat Forazi -- bdnews24.com found.\\nRefat Shorif\\nRefat spent 19 days in jail after being arrested with 100 yaba tablets in his possession on May 11, according to police. He was killed just a few weeks after the incident. Nayon and Rifat Forazi were seen stabbing Refat in the viral video. The other assailants included Rifat's brother Rishan Forazi.\\nInspired by the celebrated British spy in fiction and movies, James Bond, Nayon and his accomplices opened a Facebook group called 'Bond 007'. The gang dealt drugs, carried out extortion and mugging in the locality, allege some locals.\\nNayon, Refat and Rifat Forazi were all seen hanging out together but they fell out after Refat’s arrest a few months back, they said.\\nThe two brothers, Rifat and Rishan, are relatives of local Awami League leader and Barguna District Council Chairman Delwar Hossain and participated in different programmes of Bangladesh Chhatra League.\\nNayon, on the other hand, was once a member of Bangladesh Jatiyatabadi Chhatradal, the student wing of the BNP. It is alleged that he was later patronised by Sunam Debnath, science and technology affairs secretary in the district wing of Awami League. Sunam is the son of local Awami League MP Dhirendra Debnath Shambhu.\\nRefat’s wife Minny was once married to Nayon, claimed locals. But Minny has repeatedly denied their union, claiming Nayon had forced her to sign the marriage document.\\nNayon claimed Minny was still his wife when Refat married her two months ago, creating a deeper rift between two friends and culminating in the murder of Refat, OC Abir Mohammed Hossain had said earlier.\\nBarguna Police Superintendent Maruf Hossain also mentioned ‘dispute over winning Minny’s heart’ as the motive behind the murder, but a video footage of the incident shows the ‘conflict between drug dealers’ playing a vital role in the murder.\\nThe video footage from the CC camera at the college gate shows Rifat Forazi leading the entire process of capturing Refat, getting the sickle and stabbing him.\\nRifat Forazi\\nThe question which then arises is why were Rifat Forazi and Rishan Forazi so keen on attacking Refat, if Minny had been the centre of the conflict?\\nEarlier, Refat and his accomplices had beaten up Rifat Forazi, seemingly because of the former’s arrest a few months ago.\\nRefat was arrested carrying drugs on May 11 and went to jail, said Sohel Khan, assistant sub-inspector of Barguna Police Station. The video of Refat’s arrest had spread on Facebook, and he held Nayon responsible for it.\\nHe was released from jail in the beginning of June and launched an attack on Rifat Forazi, which incensed the Forazi brothers, according to locals.\\nDulal Shorif, Refat’s father has been denying the drug charges against his son, claiming he had been snared by Nayon.\\nThe row of drug dealing between Refat and Nayon was mentioned by Minny’s uncle Abu Saleh too.\\n“On Jun 24, two days before his murder, Refat snatched the mobile phone of a young man called Helal as he bought yaba pills from him but never paid for it,” he said.\\nHelal went to Nayon Bond to help him recover his mobile phone and Nayon requested Minny to do it, said Abu Saleh.\\nA meeting between Minny and Nayon the day before murder, mentioned by the investigating officers, was related to that phone.“Minny was physically abused by her husband when she tried to recover the phone. She told Nayon Bond about the incident who in turn sought to punish Refat for attacking her,” said a police official, requesting anonymity.\\nThe plot to murder Refat then unfolded in the ‘Bond 007’ group thread on Facebook messenger. The messages showed that Rifat Forazi was asking another group member to come to the college with a sickle.\\nGangs of young criminals similar to Bond 007 have been terrorising the people of Barguna district. These groups include ‘Team 61’, ‘Larelappa,’ ‘Honey Bond’ etc. They do drugs and roam around the city on motorbikes, allege locals.\\nThe primary motive behind the murder of Refat is rooted in ‘drugs and young gangs’ said Barguna District Citizen Rights Conservation Council President Advocate Md Anisur Rahman.\\n“The young men have to go through three stages of scrutiny before they are enlisted into these gangs. Firstly, they have to take drugs, secondly, they have to deal drugs and lastly, mug or extort people when needed,” he said.\\nMany of these gang members ride expensive bikes and use smartphones worth Tk 60,000, which points to drug trading as their main source of income, said Anisur.\\nAlmost all educational institutions in Barguna have ‘drug gangs’ in them, leading the students to do drugs, said human rights activist Hasanur Rahman.\\nThe nexus of drug dealers is patronised by Sunam, the son of local MP Dhirendra, alleged Barguna Chhatra League President Zubair Adnan Anik. The gangs are created by Sunam, he said.\\nNayon, who was killed in a ‘shootout’ with police once had a ‘good’ relationship with Sunam, said Nayon’s mother Shahida Begum. But the relationship deteriorated during the last upazila election, she added.\\nSunam denied all allegations, saying a group of Awami League leaders opposed his father Dhirendra getting the Awami League nomination in the parliamentary election and are now raising false allegations of drug dealing against Sunam to smear his father.\\nPeople of Barguna demanded that the authorities conduct a drive against drug dealers in the town following the death of Refat.

Her arthritis drug put her at risk. Helen Tschannen died from a fungal infection. Her arthritis drug, a biologic put her at risk. Angela Peterson, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\\nMILWAUKEE – Every night, a slew of TV commercials hammer home the benefits of drugs that treat autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis – and tack on a reminder about the risks they carry.\\nMore than most, Tom Leith knows the possible perils.\\nOver the last 20 years, he has been on three of the drugs for his rheumatoid arthritis: Enbrel, Orencia and Rituxan.\\nIn that time, he has had at least two serious medical problems: A life-threatening case of viral meningitis in 2017 and, a short time later, a suspected cancerous tumor on his lung. Doctors say both could be related to the drugs, but there is no way to know for sure.\\nThe drugs are known as biologic medicines, or biologics. Made from living organisms, such as animal cells, instead of chemicals, they have flooded the market over the last two decades – bringing with them promise and pitfalls.\\nBy tamping down overactive immune systems, the drugs can lead to substantial improvement, even remission. But in doing so, they leave patients more susceptible to sometimes-deadly infections and other serious side effects.\\nIn many cases, the problems emerged only after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration deemed the drugs safe and effective treatments and allowed them on the market.\\nAt least 25 times since 2000, the FDA or drug manufacturers have issued warnings, safety updates or found potential signals of serious risk with the drugs, a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel analysis found.\\nOf the 21 biologic drugs that have won FDA approval, 13 – 62% – have received the agency’s most stringent warning, known as a “black box.” In the majority of those, the warnings were added when new problems were identified after the drugs were on the market.\\nThat’s more than the percentage of warnings found in a 2017 study of new drugs. That study, published in JAMA, found that of 222 drugs that got on the market between 2001 and 2010, 27% later received a black box warning.\\nThe individual risks from biologic drugs are rare, but they span a growing range of serious problems, including invasive fungal infections; tuberculosis; the bacterial infections listeria and legionella; sepsis; an often-fatal viral brain infection; cancer; heart failure; and liver failure.\\nWhat’s more, in rare cases the drugs may leave some patients who are using them to treat autoimmune diseases susceptible to contracting other autoimmune diseases.\\n“You have to weigh the risks and what you are looking for in your quality of life,” said Leith, 64, who lives near Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.\\nDark side effects: Biologics to treat arthritis have flooded the market. They\\'re also linked to 34,000 deaths\\nWhen he was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in 1983, doctors told him he would be in a wheelchair in five years. Thirty-six years later, he still is walking.\\n“I would not change a thing,” he said.\\nAn earlier Journal Sentinel analysis of FDA data found reports linking biologic drugs to more than 500,000 serious side effects since 2004, including more than 34,000 deaths.\\nThe analysis focused on the 19 drugs still on the market. It was limited to biologic drugs that are used to treat conditions of the skin, joints and gastrointestinal system. That is, conditions caused by faulty immune systems.\\nWhile the FDA database has limitations, including a lack of verification of the reports and the possibility that other drugs also could have been used, it is the largest publicly available data set of reactions associated with prescription drugs.\\nIf anything, experts say, it undercounts the total potentially dangerous incidents.\\n“We are learning a lot that we didn’t know at the time of approval,” said Joseph Ross, an associate professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine, who has studied drug safety. “It raises the question of should we be regulating them differently.”\\nBenefit vs. risk\\nConsider the case of Raptiva.\\nIn 2003, drugmaker Genentech submitted an upbeat report to the FDA about Raptiva, for which it was seeking approval to treat psoriasis.\\nThe company said, based on clinical trials, there were few serious side effects and no evidence of increased infections.\\n“The benefits experienced by most subjects treated with Raptiva outweigh any potential, infrequent risks,” Genentech said in its report. “Raptiva provides a significant new, safe, and efficacious alternative for patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.”\\nThe FDA gave its approval.\\nThen bad things started happening.\\nAfter reports of patients experiencing problems were submitted to the FDA and additional trials turned up new side effects, warnings for Raptiva were issued for a potentially serious red blood cell disorder; susceptibility to a flesh-eating bacteria; pneumonia; viral meningitis; and invasive fungal infections.\\nIn 2008, the FDA issued a “black box” warning on the drug for its association with life-threatening infections, including a rare, but often fatal, viral brain infection known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or PML.\\nA year later, the FDA and the company announced Raptiva was being pulled from the market because of PML brain infections in four users, including three who died.\\nThe Journal Sentinel analysis of FDA data showed 1,470 reports of serious “adverse events” linked to the drug, including 189 deaths.\\nGenentech spokeswoman Allison Neves said the decision to withdraw the drug was based on the company’s assessment of the balance between benefit and risk.\\n“It was decided that the benefit risk profile had significantly changed,” she said. “The decision was made based on our commitment to patient safety.\"\\nIt was a rare move in the world of biologic drugs.\\n‘No drug is risk-free’\\nThe FDA says it issues black-box warnings when a serious – or life-threatening – risk is detected, but the drug’s overall risk-benefit profile remains favorable.\\nOf the 19 biologics that treat conditions of the skin, joints and gastrointestinal system on the market, 12 have black box warnings.\\n“We know an enormous amount more about these products now,” said Caleb Alexander, a drug safety expert with Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\\nAlexander said there is a certain amount of subjectivity that goes into FDA decisions, including how it factors in the magnitude of risk, the level of uncertainty, the need for the drug and the number of people using it.\\n“The FDA doesn’t like to pick winners and to pick on a single product,” he said. “The FDA has quite a tolerance for risk.”\\nFew competitors: Biologic drugmakers use patents, suits to thwart generic competition\\nWhen a drug is taken off the market, he said, the decision is often made by the company based on the potential cost of lawsuits versus the lost revenue if it is no longer for sale.\\nNathan Arnold, a spokesman for the FDA, noted “new safety issues can arise at any time regardless of how long a drug has been in use or its past record of safety.”\\nArnold said there is intense scrutiny of drugs by the agency before they are approved, but acknowledged that “much work still remains to monitor approved drugs over time” and said: “No drug is risk-free, and it is not uncommon for new information to be discovered after a drug is on the market and being used by larger numbers of patients.”\\n‘The right path for us’\\nWhen Leith was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in 1983, at age 29, there were no biologic drugs for the condition on the market.\\nRheumatoid arthritis, which causes inflammation, leading to swelling, pain, stiffness and potential damage to the joints, affects more than 1 million Americans.\\nHis initial treatment involved generic drugs, including steroids and opioids, prescribed to control his pain. He was able to continue his work as a park ranger at Big Foot Beach State Park on Lake Geneva. He also worked as a part-time police officer for several departments in the area.\\nBut working became increasingly difficult.\\nThe ranger job required walking several miles a day, cutting up dead trees and sometimes doing repairs with tools.\\nIf he needed to loosen a bolt, he would use a pipe to get extra leverage. As the swelling and pain increased, he upped his use of steroids and pain drugs.\\nThe steroids made him more susceptible to tears and breaks of tendons and bones, including a broken leg in 1993, an Achilles tendon tear in 1995 and a rotator cuff tear in 2004.\\n“I muddled through it,” he said.\\nIn 1998, the FDA approved Enbrel for treating rheumatoid arthritis.\\nLeith went on the drug in the early 2000s. Going on it allowed him to be weaned off the opioids.\\nHe said Enbrel, which is given weekly by injection, helped control his symptoms. He was able to walk with less pain and he had less swelling in his joints, but after about three years it stopped working.\\nHis doctor shifted him to a different biologic, Orencia, which was given by infusion on about a monthly basis. That also worked for several years before losing its effectiveness.\\nAround this time, in 2006, Leith took early retirement and went on disability.\\nHe went on his third biologic, Rituxan, in about 2010.\\nThat helped control his arthritis until 2017 when, two days after an infusion, he was severely stricken with viral meningitis, an infection that inflames tissues that cover the brain and spinal cord.\\nHe ended up in the intensive care unit for a week. Following that, he spent 30 days at home hooked to an IV that delivered antiviral medication.\\nIn early 2018, a small tumor was found on his lung. He said doctors suspect it is cancerous and might be related to his medication. He has recently been diagnosed with nonalcoholic liver cirrhosis and is on the transplant list.\\nOver the years, he’s also had more than 20 squamous cell skin cancers removed from his hands, arms and scalp. He said doctors believe those too may be related to his use of biologics.\\nLike Raptiva, the drug Rituxan is made by Genentech. Neves, the company spokeswoman, said the company’s review of safety data shows that cirrhosis has not been identified as a side effect from Rituxan.\\nShe also noted that rheumatoid arthritis patients, in general, are at increased risk for cancers and there is no evidence that those patients who use Rituxan face an additional risk.\\nShe acknowledged that Rituxan users are at increased risk for serious viral and other infections.\\nAfter an inquiry was made about Leith’s case by a reporter, she said the information would be given to Genentech’s drug safety team, which will enter it into its safety database of reported adverse events.\\n“Every side effect they warn you about, I probably had,” Leith said.\\nThough it is impossible to predict how long an individual with rheumatoid arthritis will live, people with the disease have a life expectancy that can be 10 years shorter than normal.\\n“It think it was the right path for us,” said Leith’s wife, Kathy. “You don’t get out of here alive. We’ve had some really good times.”\\nLeith now is on a generic, non-biologic drug, mycophenolate, which also suppresses the immune system. It was developed originally to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients but sometimes is used in people with rheumatoid arthritis.\\nLeith says his arthritis is under control.\\n“If I could do it all over again I probably wouldn\\'t change anything given the information available at the time,” he said. “The biologics definitely did increase my quality of life.”\\n‘I feel like I have a normal life’\\nMany biologic drugs are approved to treat multiple conditions. And for each condition, there is a range of outcomes.\\nFor inflammatory bowel-related diseases, such as colitis and Crohn’s, remission rates are between 20% to 30% with biologic drugs, said David Rubin, a professor of medicine at the University of Chicago who also works as a consultant for several companies that market biologic drugs.\\nBetween 40% and 60% see significant improvement, said Rubin, chairman-elect of the scientific advisory committee of the Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. In some company-run clinical trials, rates of remission and significant improvement exceeded those numbers.\\nSerious side effects occur in about 1% of people under the age of 60 and 5% to 6% in those older than 60, Rubin said.\\n“People who are on these therapies recognize the benefits,” he said, noting patients should also understand the risks. “It is about education.”\\nMegan Starshak, 35, was diagnosed in 2002 with colitis, an inflammatory condition of the colon that is caused by a faulty immune system.\\nIt began to dominate her life, causing abdominal pain, fatigue and the need to go to the bathroom up to 12 times a day.\\nShe often was afraid to go out because she didn’t know if a bathroom would be nearby.\\n“I just sat in my apartment with my dog,” said Starshak, who lives in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin.\\nFor a few years, she tried to manage the condition with non-biologic drugs. In 2008, she got her first infusion of Remicade and within a few days started feeling better. Her disease has been in remission ever since.\\n“I feel like I have a normal life,” she said.\\nStarshak said she knows the risks that come with the drug.\\n“Everything has its pros and cons,” she said. “If I didn’t try it, I would have had a 100% chance of having a miserable life.”\\nA changing safety profile\\nIn 1998, Enbrel became one of the first biologics on the market when it was approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis.\\nEnbrel is known as a tumor necrosis factor (or TNF) blocker. For those without autoimmune diseases, TNF is kept in balance naturally. Like the biologics Humira and Remicade, Enbrel works by using proteins made in cells to help control inflammation.\\nSince 2004, Enbrel has been linked to reports of 135,000 serious adverse events, including 8,000 deaths, according to the Journal Sentinel analysis of FDA’s adverse events reporting system.\\nMany patients may not read or understand the full label – usually found in a folded piece of paper in the original packaging – but it provides the comprehensive list of what is known about the drug.\\nEnbrel is an example of a drug’s safety profile that has changed significantly over the years.\\nThe 1998 label says “the possibility exists” for drugs like Enbrel to affect the ability of a person to fight infections and cancers, but that the impact of Enbrel on cancers and infections “is not fully understood.”\\nThen it offered some reassuring points:\\nColds and sinus infections were the most common infections.\\nIn clinical trials of Enbrel, no increase in serious infections was found.\\nThe rates of cancers were similar to what was expected for those who were being studied.\\nThe 2018 label, which – after 21 years on the market – is the culmination of numerous updates, offers a more formidable series of warnings. Chief among them are black-box warnings for:\\n“Increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis), and infections due to other opportunistic pathogens.”\\n“Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers, including Enbrel.”\\nLooking back, the FDA-approved language on the 1998 label was too weak, said Michael Carome, a physician with the watchdog group Public Citizen.\\n“It is remarkable how much more there is now about the risks,” he said.\\nTrish Hawkins, a spokeswoman for Enbrel maker Amgen, said the drug has led to significant and often life-changing improvements for patients:\\n“While changes to a product’s safety information may occur over time as more real-world and clinical data are collected, analyzed and incorporated, Enbrel’s benefits outweigh its risks.”\\n‘I am pretty fortunate’\\nIn the early 2000s, warnings about transverse myelitis started appearing on the labels of some biologic drugs that are TNF blockers.\\nTransverse myelitis is one of several conditions that involve inflammation of nerve cells that can occur in people using biologics. The condition can cause pain, weakness and paralysis in the arms and legs. It often occurs after infections.\\nIt is estimated that 33,000 Americans have some type of disability caused by transverse myelitis, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. MS is a related and often disabling condition of the central nervous system. In rare cases, it too has been associated with use of TNF blockers, according to the information on the drug labels.\\nMore than 400 cases of various forms of myelitis in people taking biologics have been reported to the FDA since 2004, according to the Journal Sentinel analysis.\\nJeremy Bennett, 44, of Columbus, Ohio, has spent eight years on biologic drugs and now faces the effects of transverse myelitis.\\nBennett had suffered from bad psoriasis since he was a teenager, but none of the traditional drugs worked well. He also developed a related condition, psoriatic arthritis, which flared up with hip pain whenever he walked on concrete.\\nThen, at age 36, Bennett was put on Enbrel. Within a matter of months, his psoriasis cleared up.\\nHowever, in the summer after he went on the drug he started feeling numbness in his fingertips. Tests were done, but no cause could be found. The numbness went away but came back a few months later.\\nThen, one night he woke up and his entire right arm was numb.\\n“I tried shaking it out, but it wasn’t going away,” he said.\\nA battery of tests and scans were done, including an MRI.\\n“The doctor calls and says, ‘We’ve got something here,’ ” Bennett recalled.\\nHe was diagnosed with transverse myelitis. By then, the condition had gotten extremely painful and had spread to his neck. For a time, the numbness spread to his right leg, which forced him to walk with a cane.\\nBennett said his doctors surmised that Enbrel may have played a role in the condition and he was immediately taken off the drug. It is not known whether Enbrel caused the transverse myelitis or was some sort of catalyst.\\nRegardless, he never went back on Enbrel, which caused his psoriasis to return.\\nHe now is using the biologic Cosentyx, which works differently than Enbrel. He said he knows there are risks with Cosentyx – “I was scared at first” – but unlike Enbrel, it does not carry a black-box warning.\\nBennett said Cosentyx is about 90% as effective as Enbrel in controlling his psoriasis and a related form of arthritis.\\nBennett, who now works for the Transverse Myelitis Association, said he has some permanent nerve pain in his arm, but he is able to use it.\\n“I am pretty fortunate compared to some people I know,” he said. “I know people who are paralyzed.”\\nFollow John Fauber on Twitter: @Fauber_MJS\\nAbout this project\\nThis story — and others in this series — was produced with the support of the National Institute for Health Care Management Foundation.

Like a Thai man who courageously drove his car on Bangkok airport’s runway under the influence of drugs on January 14, 2021. The incident occurred on Thursday at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport when a man drove his car onto the runway. However, the airport security quickly apprehended the defaulter, according to The Thaiger report.\\nA footage from the airport released by Thai Visa shows a car being escorted by airport security officials as an airplane passes by. The report further mentioned that the Airports of Thailand released a statement saying the man was “quickly” apprehended, preventing any disaster. Thai Visa reported that the security officials also found methamphetamine in the man’s vehicle. The man was arrested on charges of entering a restricted area of an airport, illegal possession of drugs, and driving under the influence of drugs after he was arrested by the police.\\nThe video was also shared on Twitter by a user Khongsak that has garnered over 10,85,000 views. The video shows a car being led out of the airport by bike that is most likely led by airport security.\\nHowever, this is not the first time that a person has brought their car into the airport, breaking the laws and skipping security checks. In 2016, a drunk man in Russia sparked off a security scare after he rammed his car into the Kazan airport to “fight for love”. An AP report mentioned that the Kazan Airport administration reported an alcoholic man ramming through the terminal’s door and driving past the check-in desk and into a departure gate before it reached a railway terminal.\\nThe man was apprehended by security forces and was identified as 40-year-old Ruslan Nurtdinov, who told a court hearing that he had planned his route carefully. He told the judge that he had to get on the platform since he was fighting for love. The report further mentioned that Nurtdinov planned to enter the railway station to meet his lady friend who was arriving at the platform, and this was his way to greet her. A quite aggressive way indeed!\\nAfter the recent incident that took place in Bangkok, the airport authorities are trying to figure out how the security breach happened to prevent any further incidents that may cause some serious accidents endangering lives of the passengers onboard.',\n",

       " \"John Daley/CPR News Curt Hayes, an oral surgeon in Lafayette, Colorado, holds up a bottle of a Exparel, a local anesthetic that is not an opioid.\\nWisdom teeth surgery involves pliers, so there's often some post-operative pain. For years, dentists have prescribed painkilling opioids, like percocet or vicodin for patients.\\nBut with opioid abuse claiming lives in Colorado and across the country, oral surgeons and other health care providers are looking to alternatives. Lafayette oral surgeon Curt Hayes recently switched to FDA-approved local anesthetic Exparel, a non-opioid. When he injects it into his patient's’ gums the area will stay numb and pain free for two to three days.\\nHe can now generally remove wisdom teeth without using any narcotics for pain — so there’s no need to prescribe his patient a dozen or more pills.\\n“I've backed off to where I don't give any narcotics whatsoever,” said Hayes. “I have people just using ibuprofen and then over-the-counter Tylenol, and that's acceptable. And it takes care of the pain.”\\nHayes followed the development of Exparel, also known by its generic name bupivacaine, in journals. Other doctors started using it for C-Sections. He started using it mainly for patients who had abused narcotics in the past, to avoid relapses. After seeing positive results, Hayes started making it an option for all his patients.\\n“We need to be looking at every aspect of the opioid crisis,” Hayes said.\\nMake no mistake, there is a crisis. Drug overdose deaths are taking a greater and greater toll in Colorado — in 2016, a record 912 people died from an overdose, according to data recently released by the state health department.\\nIn that same year, 300 people died from an opioid overdose in Colorado. Opioid use often leads to an addiction to heroin, which claimed another 228 lives. Taken together, those two causes now rival deaths from diabetes, car accidents, or chronic liver disease.\\n“Opioids ought to be drugs of last resort, not drugs of first choice,” said Robert Valuck, coordinating center director of the Colorado Consortium for Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention. Valuck, a professor at the University of Colorado Schools of Pharmacy, said medicine cabinets that contain leftover pills are often the gateway to an opioid addiction.\\nOne strategy to combat that is to reduce the number of pills doctors prescribe in the first place, Valuck said.\\nColorado’s dental board is developing new best practices and the Colorado Dental Association is holding educational seminars. Dr. Brett Kessler, a dentist in Denver and past president of the state association, said across the board, medical providers are re-examining their role in the opioid crisis.\\n“It’s on every health care practitioner's mind,” Kessler said. “Looking for alternatives to manage the pain is huge, and it’s a growing trend nationally.”\\nKessler notes many teens and young adults get their first exposure to the narcotics when they get wisdom teeth removed. “There’s studies out there that show if you give more than a three-day dose of opiates they’ve got a much higher chance of becoming addicted later in life,” Kessler said.\\nLike any drug, Exparel comes with warnings and potential side effects. For example, the website Drugs.com urges that to “make sure Exparel is safe for you,” patients should tell their doctors if they have ever had liver disease, kidney disease, heart disease, a heart rhythm disorder or seizures. Possible side effects include nausea, vomiting or constipation.\\nPatient Paula Ryan was in Dr. Hayes office recently for a tooth extraction. They discussed her pain management options and she choose the non-opioid alternative.\\nShe’s a mom, and remembers having another dental surgery years ago. Then she was prescribed opioids for pain and was pretty out of it for a few days. She prefers the alternative.\\n“I was wide awake and I could do whatever I needed to do and I was there for my daughter,” Ryan said. “It’s a much better outcome.”\\nExparel costs between $250 and $400, and Dr. Hayes said it is not covered by insurance. But potential cost didn’t keep patient Flora Brewington from choosing it. She’s an MD, practicing family medicine, and opted for the non-opioid method to manage her post-operative pain. “I can’t think of a disadvantage other than having to pay out of pocket,” Brewington said.\\nPlus she’d rather not have any extra pills forgotten in some medicine cabinet, just waiting to be discovered. “I have two little kids at home and it’s best not to have narcotics sitting around,” Brewington said.\\nExperts say it’s that kind of awareness, from both medical patients and providers, that’ll be crucial to turning the corner on the opioid crisis.\",\n",

       " 'A Novartis subsidiary, AveXis, produces Zolgensma, the drug at the center of the fundraising appeal | Sebastien Bozon/AFP via Getty Images Belgian family hits fundraising target for world’s priciest drug Fundraiser marks second drive in Europe for expensive drugs.\\nThe family of a 9-month-old Belgian infant, Pia Boehnke, has raised almost €2 million in three days to pay for the spinal muscular atrophy drug Zolgensma, which has been approved in the U.S. but not in Europe, HLN reported Wednesday.\\nPia\\'s mother appeared on Belgian television late Wednesday to thank \"all of Belgium\" for supporting their fundraiser.\\nDonors sent money through text message, with €2 donated for each message sent. The family will have to figure out whether to go to the U.S. or to France or Portugal to get the drug administered to Pia so that she can be treated for the deadly, muscle-destroying disease, her mother told HLN.\\nZolgensma is administered through a one-time injection that targets the cause of the rare disease affecting Pia. While it is not a cure, it \"improves muscle movement and function,\" giving children with the disease a chance to live. Otherwise, they would likely die before the age of 2, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which approved the therapy earlier this year.\\n\"We know very well that it\\'s not possible to fully cure her,\" Pia\\'s mother, Ellen De Meyer, told Belgian broadcaster RTBF. \"But a life in a wheelchair would be already very good.\"\\nPia\\'s case is very similar to that of the Portuguese baby Matilde, whose family managed this summer to raise money for Zolgensma. The Portuguese authorities paid for the drug in the end, local media reported.\\nZolgensma, produced by Novartis subsidiary AveXis, is part of the latest generation of individualized therapies and carries a price tag of $2.1 million in the U.S. — which makes it the most expensive drug in the world. The gene therapy works by delivering a copy of a working gene that is dysfunctional in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).\\nThe European Medicines Agency is due to issue a decision on approval before year-end, and the drug\\'s hefty price tag has brought the need to find sustainable payment solutions into sharp focus. Zolgensma has faced investigations into manipulated data from tests on mice submitted to both U.S. and EU drugs authorities, but it remains on the market in the U.S.\\nNovartis defended its U.S. price in a statement on Tuesday, saying that it \"was based on our analysis of treatment as a one-off, transformative therapy for an extremely rare disease. Among other things, we looked at the current cost of chronic SMA therapy for ten years,\" the company said, according to De Standaard.\\nThe drugmaker didn\\'t give any information about how much the therapy could cost in Europe once approved, according to the same report.\\nAnother drug for SMA, Spinraza, is reimbursed in Belgium, but, unlike Zolgensma, it has to be administered for the duration of a patient\\'s life.',\n",

       " 'Who’s to blame for the current drug crisis? Obama\\nThe first three parts of this series on the “opioid crisis” are here , here, and here.\\nThe Nevada Department of Health and Human Resources recently put out a report that states, “Opioid-related deaths in Nevada have decreased slightly since 2010, but the number of fatal heroin overdoses has nearly tripled since then.” In other words, for the entire duration of “the opioid crisis,” prescription-related deaths have actually gone down, while the entire epidemic has been fueled by illicit drugs. This is the same story we’ve seen from data published in almost every state with high drug overdose death rates.\\nWith prescription opioid deaths beginning to plummet before the epidemic levels of overdoses began to soar, everyone seeking the truth should ask the following question: What happened from 2012 to 2015 to make the supply of heroin and new deadly synthetic drugs spike to stratospherically high levels?\\nThe notion that suddenly a bunch of people who broke their legs or who had painful, chronic illnesses decided to switch from oxycodone to heroin in a matter of a year or two is absurd.\\nOpen borders and DACA led directly to the drug crisis\\nThe reality is, as I noted a few weeks ago, our immigration policies and sanctuary cities played a large role in increasing the supply of deadly drugs to insane levels relative to what we’ve seen in the past. The two years with the biggest surge in heroin seizures at the border, by far, were 2014 and 2015, the years with the largest surge of Central Americans who came because of the promise of DACA. The epidemic-level surge in heroin and fentanyl unmistakably coincided with Obama’s shutdown of immigration enforcement between 2010 and 2013. The promise of Obama’s amnesty resulted in the surge in young male drug mules from Central America, the enriching of the drug cartels who control the smuggling routes, the growth of MS-13 drug distributors, and the poisoning of our people.\\nAll of the heroin and much of the fentanyl comes from Mexican drug cartels, such as Siniloa. Much of the Chinese-based fentanyl is also trafficked within our country by the Mexican drug cartels, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The open-borders policies were so blatant that they provided these cartels with a profitable smuggling business. The proceeds were used to produce even more dangerous drugs and enhance the smuggling network.\\nThis is where DACA, “dream” amnesty, the suspension of immigration enforcement, sanctuary cities, and the ensuing surge of Central American teenagers explain the source of the epidemic levels of drugs suddenly appearing from 2013 to 2015.\\nAt one point, Mexican heroin was dirty, impure, black tar heroin, poorly refined and more dangerous than purer herion. Now, high-purity powder heroin is everywhere. The open borders that enabled that kind of mass drug trafficking have made Mexico into a war zone. On the American side, a 2016 study in the New England Journal of Medicine concluded that this is also what’s driving the heroin epidemic. “…[H]eroin market forces, including increased accessibility, reduced price, and high purity of heroin appear to be major drivers of the recent increases in rates of heroin use.”\\nLower prices and higher purity mean that you can now try heroin for $10 or $15, and the purity is high enough that you can snort it instead of having to “cook” it in a spoon and inject it in your arm. That removes much of the stigma of heroin and makes it seem like a “normal” drug — with a stronger high than cocaine or marijuana.\\nThus, the same drug culture we’ve had in this country since the ’60s – long before the rise of prescription opioids in the late ’90s – mixed with the open-borders surge in supply is now poisoning our people. This has nothing to do with health care, doctors, or prescriptions.\\nThe connection between illegal immigration and this flood of drugs is obvious — when you have large numbers of illegal aliens crossing the border, you have enormous opportunities to use them as drug mules (in exchange for getting them across the border, or just for not killing them). Sanctuary cities also function as a magnet to encourage more illegal immigration and thus more drug mule opportunities. Additionally, with so many illegal aliens crossing the border, it’s much easier for cartel members themselves to sneak in unnoticed among the flood of people. Finally, to move the drug profits back south, cartels pay other aliens to smuggle the cash and weapons back across the border.\\nThis, in a nutshell, is the drug overdose crisis the media and the politicians refuse to even recognize.\\nThe DACA/border surge-driven gang crisis is helping drive the drug crisis\\nThe Texas Department of Public Safety observed that much of the uptick in drug trafficking, coinciding with the unprecedented level of supply and overdose deaths, was through the symbiotic relationship between the cartels in Mexico and the gangs operating within our borders. Its most recent report notes that “as long as illicit cross-border crimes are profitable, the relationship between cartels and gangs will continue.”\\nThe connection between the rise of MS-13 and the drug crisis was further brought to light in January, when 17 gang members were arrested in Long Island for murder, but also for drug trafficking. Remember that even the media has noticed we have a nationwide MS-13 resurgence, particularly in Long Island. Is should, therefore, come as no surprise that the degree of drug trafficking tracks closely with the uptick in Central American gang activity.\\nThis is such a gratuitous and avoidable problem. The proper coordination between ICE and local law enforcement successfully placed MS-13 on the ropes and could work again to break up the drug cartels. Not surprisingly, since Obama suspended the 287(g) program, there’s been a universally recognized resurgence in MS-13. In a 2013 report, the Texas Department of Public Safety warned of the developing relationships between the drug cartels and the gangs and that the gangs “increase their power and acquire wholesale quantities of drugs at lower prices, while the cartels extend their network of connections deeper into the United States.”\\nSanctuary cities serve as magnets for drugs and also prevent us from solving the crisis\\nBorder security and aggressive interior enforcement are the only things that can break that link. If the cartels can’t get access to their profits, they have no reason to sell drugs in the U.S. in the first place.\\nAnd while not all drugs are brought in by illegal aliens (some are brought in at the points of entry), the smuggling routes are staffed at all top levels almost exclusively by foreign nationals. Thus, if we abolished sanctuary cities and immediately apprehended and deported all criminal aliens, almost the entire personnel structure of the smuggling within our country would dry up – not completely, but to at least pre-crisis levels. We will never kick all drugs out of America, but we can certainly kick out those who bring in the worst type of drugs in large quantities and who shouldn’t be here anyway. Drying up the supply will make the cost and access to illicit drugs much more prohibitive.\\nAs Sherriff Andy Louderback of Jackson County, Texas, testified before the House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration:\\nIn the case of heroin, the drugs are largely manufactured in Mexico with a majority controlled by Sinaloa cartel. Not only is the Sinaloa cartel manufacturing heroin, they are also producing fentanyl. And the Sinaloa cartel has been expanding its operations – not only drug trafficking but also human smuggling, extortion, and child labor. These sanctuary cities are a cog in the expanding opioid crisis, as evidenced in the recent drug bust in Boston. They send a clear signal…they also serve as an invitation for criminal aliens smuggling opioids and other narcotics that they will be shielded from federal law enforcement.\\nActing ICE Director Thomas Homan recently noted that sanctuary cities have pulled their officers out of task forces cooperating with combating the drug cartels and that sanctuaries are serving as a “selling point” for illegal alien smuggling. The cartels know that fugitive cities will protect them. What do the cartels do with the proceeds of their smuggling? They use them for more drug production and smuggling.\\nWhen President Trump mentioned the fact that sanctuary cities such as Lawrence, Massachusetts, are responsible for bringing in deadly drugs from Mexican cartels and poisoning New Hampshire, liberals derided it by suggesting that New England has few Mexicans living there. Yet the Boston Globe, in 2017, before this became politicized, admitted that “Mexican cartels are delivering vast quantities of the inexpensive and powerful synthetic drug fentanyl to New England” through “a pipeline that often begins in China, winds through Mexico, and flows into distribution cities such as Lawrence and Springfield.” Much as in West Virginia, the secondary trafficking brings the drugs to more remote areas after the cartels bring them to the major hubs, which refutes the entire straw man about demographics and geography.\\nI’m not saying we can declare a new war on drugs and prevent all illicit drugs from entering this country. A direct war on drugs doesn’t work, much like a war on guns doesn’t work. But as with criminal justice, targeting the criminals works to stop all violence, including gun violence, and targeting criminal aliens, smugglers, and gangs will at least mitigate some of the problem. This is especially true of drug smugglers, given that most of them are foreign nationals who can and should be deported. We don’t need a lengthy criminal justice process to land a conviction; we just need to throw them out. Sure, we always had a drug problem and always will have one, but I think we would all give anything to return to the pre-2013 levels of drug usage and a tighter supply, where these drugs would be too expensive for many wannabe users. The huge and alarming spikes can be tied directly to the erasing of national borders and the cessation of immigration enforcement.\\nThe first rule of medicine is to do no harm. Yet the very politicians who supported the philosophies that led to the overdose epidemic are now ignoring the root causes and proposing ideas that will exacerbate it and limit our freedoms. Government is now practicing medicine by severely restricting legitimate prescriptions for painkillers, wasting billions of dollars on federal programs, and creating a de facto national prescription database. Politicians should leave medicine to medical professionals while doing their job of enforcing our sovereignty and punishing law-breakers.',\n",

       " 'SINGAPORE - Since 35-year-old Avin Tan was diagnosed with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 12 years ago, he has travelled to places like Bangkok or asked friends to obtain more cheaply two drugs that he needs to take every day.\\nHe also dropped the idea of switching to a newer drug with fewer side effects, as it costs more than he can afford.\\nSo it was welcome news that the Ministry of Health has added 16 antiretroviral drugs used for the treatment of HIV to its list of subsidised drugs as of Sept 1, making them much more affordable for thousands of Singaporeans like Mr Tan.\\nBefore this, it would cost him more than $500 a month to buy the two drugs he needs daily, Truvada and Edurant. Buying the same medication overseas in places like Bangkok would lower the cost to around $150 a month, and buying the generic version of the drug - which may not have a reliable supply chain - would cost around $55 a month.\\nThe drugs have also been added to the Medication Assistance Fund here, which allows patients who cannot afford these drugs to draw from it to help pay for them.\\nAll subsidised patients who purchase any of these 16 drugs will now receive 50 per cent or 75 per cent worth of subsidies, depending on patient\\'s means-test status, the MOH said.\\nPreviously, those living with HIV could receive help from the Medication Assistance Fund on a case-by-case basis.\\nThe MOH told The Straits Times that it regularly reviews the subsidised standard and non-standard drugs to ensure that they remain relevant to changes in local population needs, medical practice and evidence on clinical and cost effectiveness.\\n\"The inclusion of 16 antiretroviral drugs on 1 September 2020 is part of this regular review,\" it said.\\nGroups that work with HIV patients have long asked for antiretroviral drugs to be subsidised.\\nWith their inclusion at last, Mr Tan, who is advocacy and partnerships manager at the non-profit organisation Action for Aids (AFA), will be consulting his doctor soon about switching to the newer medication.\\nRelated Story Community comes up with plan to end HIV transmission and Aids in Singapore by 2030\\nLong-term use of HIV drugs could result in the premature onset of other diseases, such as hypertension, liver and kidney problems as well as osteoporosis.\\nInclusion of these drugs also assures their safety, Mr Tan said.\\n\"By making it possible for the drugs to be bought from hospitals, it allows for quality control and removes a lot of guesswork when we buy the drugs from other sources.\"\\nIt will also aid in reducing the stigma and discrimination faced by those who are HIV positive, he added.\\n\"It lowers the barriers for people to seek treatment, and allows HIV to be viewed just like any other illness.\"\\nMs Sumita Banerjee, the executive director of AFA, lauded the move, saying that it will help to normalise HIV.\\n\"Subsidies also allow people to adhere to treatment. This improves treatment outcomes and quality of life of people living with HIV. A person who is on treatment and has acquired viral load suppression cannot transmit HIV and so it is also important for HIV prevention,\" she said.\\nIn a Facebook post last Wednesday (Sept 2), Dr Wong Chen Seong, deputy director of the national HIV programme at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, said that the significance of this move could not be overstated.\\n\"The dream of ending HIV in our lifetimes is one step closer to fruition. Access to effective HIV treatment is the sine qua non (it is essential) of getting people living with HIV to an undetectable viral load, which not only forms the foundation for personal health and well-being, but also prevents onward transmission,\" he wrote.\\nAccording to the MOH, a total number of 8,618 Singapore residents had been infected with HIV as of end-2019, of whom 2,097 had died.',\n",
       " 'In 2001 Portugal decriminalised all drugs. Last month the Norwegian parliament made clear its intentions to follow this lead. Republican senators across the Atlantic are openly defending the legalisation of marijuana. It’s high time the British government realised that it’s hopelessly out of step with sensible drug policy.\\nDecriminalisation ends criminal penalties for possessing small amounts of a drug for personal use, but all other aspects of the drug market remain illegal. For Norwegian advocates of harm reduction, this might seem like a big step forward. They are probably right.\\nPrison isn’t rehab, and a criminal record is a hammer blow to an ex-user’s career prospects. By contrast, decriminalisation makes it easier for problematic users to seek treatment, which leads to decreased use among vulnerable groups. This is what happened in Portugal, as shown by multiple studies – and may explain Portugal’s extremely low rate of overdose deaths. Portugal’s decriminalisation has also reduced the number of HIV-positive people addicted to drugs. This is a huge win for public health.\\nDecriminalisation was not the only option on the table for Norway, however. As Sveinung Stensland, deputy chairman of the Norwegian parliamentary health committee, put it: “It is important to emphasise that we do not legalise cannabis and other drugs, but we decriminalise.” That’s a shame: Norway would be better off if politicians opted for legalisation.\\nDecriminalisation is not a panacea: street dealers face no competition from regulated alternatives, and there is a risk that supply to the black market will at best remain unchanged. When the London borough of Lambeth, where I live, experimented with partial decriminalisation (or “de-penalisation”) between 2001 and 2002, a surge in street dealing depressed house prices, most prominently in areas with the highest concentrations of dealing. Lower house prices may sound like good news, but they fell because dealing reduced the local quality of life. The consequences of underground drug markets are well known: more violence, more crime and more dangerous drugs.\\nCommentators such as Peter Hitchens wrongly believe that these issues are the result of British police not fighting the war on drugs harshly enough – especially for cannabis. It’s true that our prohibition is lenient in comparison with some parts of the US. But I imagine most of the 11,970 people in prison for drug offences in 2016 would have raised their eyebrows at the suggestion that we operate under “de facto decriminalisation”.\\nThere’s appetite to reform the UK’s drug laws, but it has to be done right\\nUnlike decriminalisation, a legalised, regulated market would drive many street dealers out of existence. This is especially important for underage drug users because, unlike regulated shops and pharmacies, street dealers don’t ask for ID. They also tend to be unreliable sources of information on recommended dosage, and black market drugs are rarely pure. When I go to the pub, I know whether I’m getting beer or vodka; drug buyers on the street can only hope they’re getting what they’re paying for. The UK-based drug testing organisation The Loop has reported finding drugs laced with everything from concrete to crushed-up malaria tablets at music festivals.\\nLegalisation also opens up the opportunity for significant tax revenue, which could be used to fund treatment and addiction services properly. Recent estimates have suggested that a legal UK cannabis market alone could be worth nearly £7bn a year, raising £1.05bn in tax. And while decriminalisation is a blunt tool for all drugs, legalisation allows the government to tailor regulations to suit the potential harm levels of different substances. We don’t regulate alcohol in the same way as cigarettes, and we shouldn’t treat cannabis and MDMA in the same way as heroin.\\nSome parts of the world have attempted to compromise between decriminalisation and legalisation, with poor results. When I lived in Washington DC for a year after graduating, it was legal to grow and possess cannabis for personal consumption, but illegal to sell it. Within two weeks of arriving, I was offered a $20 bottle of water with a “free gift” of cannabis, on my morning commute.\\nThere’s appetite to reform the UK’s drug laws, but it has to be done right. The public are ahead of politicians, with recent polling showing that more people support a legal, regulated cannabis market than oppose it. The government’s silence on this crucial issue is deafening. A few British politicians from across the spectrum, such as Paul Flynn, Nick Clegg and Crispin Blunt, agree with the public. I wish more would.\\nIn the wake of Norway’s decision to decriminalise drugs, politicians from all parties should use this opportunity to take a different approach to our drug policy. By opting for legalisation, we can take the market out of the hands of criminals and raise some money for treating vulnerable users while we’re at it.\\n• Daniel Pryor is head of programmes at the Adam Smith Institute',\n",
       " 'Police arrest foreign national for allegedly supplying drugs\\nThe Central Crime Branch’s investigation into the high-profile drug racket has opened a can of worms with alleged links not just to the Kannada film industry but also the business and political establishment. In its FIR, the police have named 12 accused, including Bollywood star Vivek Oberoi’s brother-in-law Aditya Alva, the son of the late minister Jeevaraj Alva and classical dancer Nandini Alva. While CCB officials confirmed his involvement, they are yet to ascertain his exact role in the drug racket.\\n“They are part of a network of people who either organised parties in star hotels, pubs, resorts and farm houses, or sourced and supplied drugs to guests. Entry to such parties was based strictly on invitation and included businessmen, celebrities, and actors, said a senior CCB official.\\nRealtor named prime accused\\nThe FIR names Shivaprakash – a realtor and former friend of actress Ragini Dwivedi – as the prime accused. “He clashed with Ravi Shankar, a second division assistant at the Jayanagar RTO, another accused in the case. In March 2019, Shivaprakash had a fight with Ravi Shankar in a hotel in Ashok Nagar after learning that he had dinner with the actress. A case was registered. If that incident had been probed in detail at the time, the racket would have come to light much earlier,” said a senior police official.\\nCCB officials suspect that Shivaprakash was peddling drugs and organising high-end parties.\\nForeigner being questioned\\nThe CCB on Saturday arrested Loum Pepper Samba, from Africa, for allegedly supplying drugs to the persons who are accused of organising these parties. “Loum Pepper Samba was arrested based on information given by Ravishankar, a second division assistant in the RTO office in Jayanagar and a close associate of film star Ragini,” said a CCB official.\\nRavi Shankar allegedly claimed to have procured party drugs from Samba, according to Assistant Commissioner of Police K.C. Goutham, who filed the FIR on Friday. “We are questioning Ragini and Samba to get information on the parties, and have prepared a list of people who attended them even during the lockdown,” said the CCB official.\\nMeanwhile, the police are waiting for the forensic report on items seized during the search of Ragini’s house the day she was arrested. These include three mobile phones, a laptop and a pack of cigarettes. “The evidence was handed over to the FSL for analysis. We are waiting for the reports while questioning Ragini. She is at the State home for women under tight security,” said the police.\\nThe other accused mentioned in the FIR include Prashanth Ranka, Vaibhav Jain, Prashanth Raju, Ashwin, Abhiswami, Rahul Thonshe and Vinay. They have been booked under Sections 21C, 27B, 27A, 29, 21 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, and also under criminal conspiracy.\\n“The accused having contacts with peddlers from Goa, Mumbai, Punjab, AP and Kerala, and also with the peddlers from foreign countries who are settled in various parts of the country,” a senior police officer said.\\nGuilty must be brought to book, says Kateel\\nChief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai are closely monitoring the police investigation into the drugs case while party leaders sought to brush aside the BJP’s ties to Kannada actor Ragini Dwivedi. She had campaigned for the BJP during the 2019 bypolls to the Assembly.\\nWhen questioned by reporters in Mysuru on Saturday, Minister for Co-operation S.T. Somashekar denied suggestions that her arrest has caused embarrassment to the party. “Why should the party be embarrassed? Did the party tell her to do it (alleged involvement with drugs)?”\\nAsserting that those involved in the drug menace must be brought to book irrespective of their social and political standing, BJP State president Nalin Kumar Kateel on Saturday said the party would walk the extra mile to supplement the government’s efforts in the fight against the drug mafia. In a release, Mr. Kateel said the BJP is committed to see that Karnataka becomes drug-free.\\n“BJP is closely watching the on-going probe into the drug mafia. The scale, the speed, the grit, the determination and the meticulousness with which the police is dealing with this dangerous racket is laudable,” he said.\\n“This menace must be eliminated, lock, stock and barrel. Those involved in this dirty and dangerous menace must be brought to book, irrespective of their social and political standing, connections and contacts with the high and mighty,” he said.\\nHe complimented Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai for their “no-nonsense and uncompromising approach” in handling this episode. “BJP welcomes Home Minister’s statement that police has been given free hand to deal with this issue. We want this probe into the drug mafia to reach its logical end. There is no question of resting till we achieve a decisive victory in this battle against drugs,” he said.',\n",

       " 'In record time, a Cambridge man was arrested, processed, pleaded guilty in Simcoe’s Ontario Court and was sent to prison for dealing in pink fentanyl.\\nIn fact, the 16 days from capture to incarceration was about a week longer than necessary because Justice Aubrey Hilliard insisted on setting up a video conference rather than sentencing Kenneth David Kerr, 45, by audio alone.\\nAnd that was to Kerr’s advantage as Hilliard watched him make a 10-minute, emotional explanation of his addiction and ongoing criminal history.\\n“I know I have a lengthy criminal record,” Kerr said.\\n“I’m an alcoholic and a drug addict and that’s what they do. They seek out bad behaviours.”\\nOn April 14, Kerr was stopped at 10:20 a.m. by an OPP Community Street Crime Unit on a tip from a confidential informant.\\nHe got out of his vehicle and, leaving the keys inside, locked it.\\nBut Kerr had left the passenger side window down and when police searched his vehicle they found about $3,000 worth of pink fentanyl and cocaine and $4,180 in cash, along with a small digital weigh scale and small plastic bags.\\nKerr could have fought it, noted the judge. He could have drawn it out and insisted on a trial. He could have gone through the process of getting a pre-sentence report to outline his addictions and problems.\\nInstead, he waived his right to a lawyer and a preliminary hearing – and even his right to wait for chemical analysis to come back proving that the drugs were indeed fentanyl and cocaine – and insisted on being sentenced as soon as possible.\\nHilliard questioned Kerr about his rush to judgment, warning him that federal prosecutor Jamie Pereira was asking for a sentence of three-and-a-half years.\\n“It’s highly unlikely I will sentence you to more than that but you understand that three and a half years is a possibility and you still wish to plead guilty,” said Hilliard.\\n“Yes,” insisted Kerr explaining that he was, however, asking the judge to consider a two-year sentence.\\nPereira said the longer sentence was important since fentanyl has led to the deaths of many Canadians and Kerr has an extensive criminal record.\\n“He’s had 68 prior convictions – eight of them for trafficking, another seven for simple possession and a conviction in 2019 for having the proceeds of drug trafficking so it’s a very significant record and he’s only 45.”\\nPereira agreed Kerr’s speedy guilty plea was a sign of remorse but noted he’s been back before the court so many times it’s an indication that rehabilitation isn’t working.\\nIn his speech to the judge, Kerr said whether he got a short or long prison sentence, he would still get the programming he needs.\\n“I have a family that needs me and that’s the only reason I’ve made it very easy to plead guilty. I’ve let my family down once again. I have a seven-year-old daughter that I haven’t seen since she was two years old,” he told the judge.\\n“I have a mother who is dying and I don’t know how to handle it.”\\nKerr was also expecting to become a grandfather in June.\\n“It’s a vicious cycle. As soon as things go wrong in my life I fall back into this cycle and I can’t stop it on my own. I’ve tried and tried and tried and I never end up having a better life. It’s always worse.”\\nKerr said he didn’t want to be characterized as an out-of-town drug dealer who came to Simcoe to prey on the locals.\\n“People think Simcoe is a place where people come to sell drugs but it’s the opposite. People come because the drugs are there.”\\nHe told the judge he wants to one day live like a “normal person” but struggles with stopping himself.\\n“God knows I do not like my life. I do not like continually going to jail and letting my family down once again. I’m willing to change. I just don’t know how.”\\nHilliard weighed that speech, Kerr’s fast plea and the substantial savings he created by not spending one or two years going through the criminal justice system, against the seriousness of the drugs he was peddling.\\n“Fentanyl is a scourge on our society and must be met with significant sentences,” she said.\\n“Mr. Kerr is also a vulnerable user and rehabilitation has not been successful. This is a journey he has to walk on his own.”\\nRecognizing both Kerr’s remorse and the pandemic situation, Hilliard opted to give him a month of time served credit and sent him to prison for a further two and a half years.\\n“This is a somewhat lighter sentence than case law would suggest,” she said. “Your situation might not get much better at a federal institution but I hope you’re able to get the benefit from counselling services so that when you’re released you will have the tools you need to make better choices.\\n“We’ve seen each other now two times. I hope this will be the last time and I wish you luck.”\\nSGamble@postmedia.com\\n@EXPSGamble',\n",

       " 'New Drugs, Repurposed Drugs, Vaccines and Serum\\nZsófia Végh\\nNever before has a disease triggered as much research in such a short amount of time in the field of drug development as coronavirus has. Groups of researchers, pharmacists and physicians all over the world are working flat out to find a cure or a vaccine, including several Hungarian teams.\\nUniversities and labs as well as players in the healthcare industry have teamed up to deliver results fast. Here we present a roundup of some of the work and the progress made so far.\\nAt the start of the coronavirus outbreak, the Ministry of Innovation and Technology (ITM) gave several research centers and universities the mandate to develop a drug that could prevent the development of the disease.\\nThe goal of the drug, developed jointly by players including Richter Gedeon Nyrt., the University of Pécs and ImmunoGenes Kft., is to prevent the virus from binding to the ACE2 receptor and thereby infecting it.\\nAnother area of research is identifying existing drugs that could be repurposed for new therapeutic goals. During a pandemic such as this, when researchers are hard pressed for time to deliver results, drug repositioning can offer a time and cost-efficient means to doing so.\\nThis is due to the fact that with the use of an active ingredient whose human safety and biological properties are supported by potentially decades of therapeutic experience, researchers can shorten the pre-clinical phase of drug development and can move on to clinical trials. Reposition-innovation is also much less costly than developing a new molecule.\\nIn Hungary, the University of Pécs, headed by Ferenc Jakab is focusing on identifying active ingredients that have already been used successfully for other diseases.\\nSet up in March, the Coronavirus Action Group of which Jakab and his team are members, is not only looking at the mechanisms of virus entry or replication and interaction with the host, but also host reactions, immune responses and inflammatory processes, infection and its consequences.\\nMulti-target Ingredient\\nIn this way, they can create a multi-target ingredient or drug combinations that can lead to wide-spectrum therapy substances. So far, the team has selected about 30 drug molecules for testing in the project, and biological studies have also begun.One drug with potential is Favipiravir, which is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug developed in 2014 in Japan against influenza infection. Clinical trials conducted by the research team with several Hungarian universities and hospitals aim to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of Favipiravir against coronavirus.ITM assigned four projects to the Hungarian Clinical Research Infrastructure Network (HECRIN) related to the coronavirus epidemic. One of these is the clinical trial of Favipiravir. Another study analyzes the genetic characteristics of COVID-patients, examining whether there is a genetic reason for the huge differences in the course and severity of the infection between individual patients. In the absence of a specific drug, several existing drugs are now being used by physicians to treat coronavirus infections all of which have been developed for a different disease.\\nA step down from the repurposing process, these drugs seek to treat similar symptoms. Among these are chloroquine, hydrochloroquine, and lopinavir and ritonavir that have been shown to be effective against, for example, malaria. These can and have been used for the treatment of patients whose condition is less severe but still need hospitalization. Researchers of the Szeged Biological Research Center (SZBK) together with its international partners at the U.K.’s Bristol University have discovered a receptor through which the virus can enter the host cell. The discovery is crucial as many researchers in the world are trying to better understand the process of the infection to provide effective treatment.\\nAI and Plasma\\nBesides Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which has already been identified as a means through which the virus can enter the cell, the neuropilin-1 (NRP1) receptor can be another target that opens a new path in the defense against the coronavirus.\\nThe team has developed a method that is unique in the world, based on artificial intelligence and deep learning. A serum prepared from the blood plasma of recovered COVID-19 patients is another treatment under development and, in fact, already at use.\\nThe immune system of a coronavirus patient produces an antibody, which can help fight defeat the disease. A ready-made antibody can be extracted from the plasma of healed and already healthy people by a special procedure. This is a great help for patients with a weakened immune system, as they are ready to receive the antibody that kills the virus in their body.\\nTo date, several recovered patients have donated their plasma in various parts of the country. That has been processed and a serum prepared that can last up to two or three years. Plasma therapy has been used on several coronavirus patients in health facilities in the country who have been removed from the ventilator and whose treatment has accelerated after receiving plasma, the doctors say.',\n",

       " 'Bill’s world was a dangerous one. He believed that people could control his mind using devices similar to a TV remote. He was not sure who was his friend and who was his foe. I found him curled up in a hospital bed, afraid to step out of his room. As a young man with schizophrenia, he had previously taken a common antipsychotic medication called haloperidol, which was no longer effective. We could have prescribed newer medications, but we wanted to avoid the weight gain that is often associated with these medications. An older, senior doctor on our team suggested we try the medication molindone.\\n“Molindone? Is that a new medication?” I asked.\\n“No, quite old,” he said.\\nWithin a week of starting molindone, Bill went from isolated and paranoid to pleasant and cooperative, and he went home soon afterwards.\\nI marveled at this miraculous transformation. Like many young doctors, I tend to prescribe medications with which I am familiar. For patients with psychosis, I was most comfortable with the so-called second-generation antipsychotics. In medical school we learned about the dreaded side effects of first-generation antipsychotics such as molindone. Most concerning was tardive dyskinesia, a potentially irreversible reaction characterized by involuntary lip-smacking and puckering movements. In clinical practice I rarely see these older medications used, other than for sedation when a patient is agitated, so my default was to prescribe second-generation antipsychotics.\\nIn addition to fewer side effects, psychiatrists were hopeful that second-generation antipsychotics would be more effective for psychotic symptoms than the older ones were. At one point I was taught that these newer medications were more effective for specific psychotic symptoms, such as lack of motivation and decreased sociality. When I began residency I was excited to hear about even newer medications called third-generation antipsychotics. My assumption was that newer was better.\\nBut in fact, newer is not necessarily better, as Bill’s story illustrates. Studies have found little to no difference in efficacy between first- and second-generation antipsychotics in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia. It is true that tardive dyskinesia is less likely to occur with second-generation medications, but the difference is not as much as was previously suggested. Second-generation drugs can also cause weight gain, which is difficult to reverse and increases risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. In addition, newer medications are more expensive. As one doctor told me, “With the cost of a 30-day supply of a newer antipsychotic, you could fill a whole room with an old antipsychotic.” These concerns are not unique to psychiatry. There are similar debates in other fields of medicine about the under-prescription of effective older medications for diabetes and hypertension. Personally, I support pharmaceutical innovation, but new medications should add benefit, not just profit.\\nThe trend toward using newer medications often develops during residency training. Pharmaceutical firms market their products to young doctors in all specialties. Whether with free meals, medical tools or travel scholarships, pharmaceutical companies find ways to influence doctors’ prescribing practices. Because most physicians continue recommending the medications they learned in residency, these companies strategically expose residents to newer medications that are still under patent and thus far more profitable for the manufacturers.\\nBucking this this trend is not always easy. A month after Bill left the hospital, we learned that the manufacturer of molindone had stopped producing the medication. As mentioned before, the side effects of some older medications can be scary. Side effects loom large because our minds are more sensitive to these adverse events than to benefits. In addition, patients may seek newer medications from their physicians for a variety of reasons—including pharmaceutical ads on TV that tell them to “ask your doctor.”\\nAlthough we cannot necessarily force a pharmaceutical company to continue manufacturing a medication, we can urge physicians—particularly younger ones—to be open to prescribing older medications. Working with senior doctors has made me a lot more comfortable with prescribing them. Working overseas, where older medications are the only ones available, has also broadened my knowledge and appreciation of them. Also, if possible, we can track our prescribing practices to increase our awareness of possible bias in favor of new drugs. Electronic health records make this more feasible. My institution recently presented us with our individual and group prescribing patterns, which has made me more conscious of which medications I tend to favor.\\nAs doctors, if we do not learn to prescribe older medications, we miss out on effective alternatives, and our patients and their insurance companies spend more than they need to.\\nTherefore, if the situation is appropriate, don’t be afraid to try something old.',\n",

       " 'As a psychotherapist who treats teenagers, I hear about what is going on with teenagers and what they are doing. I have been hearing from many teens about new designer drugs they are taking. Many people assume teenagers are primarily using marijuana. However, teenagers are looking for new drugs and ways to modify how they use marijuana. These new drugs can be very dangerous, even deadly. However, many teenagers are not aware of the dangers.\\nRecently I read an article by Angela Chen. The article discusses these new dangerous drugs and how deadly these drugs can be. I have included her article below so parents can be aware of the dangers facing their teenagers. Hopefully, parents will also take this opportunity to discuss this issue with their teenagers.\\nSpring Break is occurring and summer break is around the corner and for many teenagers this means partying and using drugs. One major issue is many Emergency Room physicians cannot keep up with all the new drugs. Therefore, if a teenager ends up in the Emergency Room due to overdosing or having a bad reaction to one of these new drugs, a teenager may die before an Emergency Room physician determines what the teenager took and how to treat it. The show The Good Doctor recently had an episode which addressed this issue. The teen had used, Molly, not a new drug but because there were so many options, the teenager almost died before they could determine how to treat him.\\nAll had smoked an \"herbal incense\" product called AK-47 24 Karat Gold. Eighteen people were sent to the hospital by ambulance. The situation had all the signs of a drug overdose, and so doctors ordered the usual tests: blood count, urine analysis, heart rate monitoring.\\nOn a July day a little over a year ago, over 30 people collapsed on a street in Brooklyn. They lay on the ground, vomiting down their shirts, twitching and blank-faced. Some, half-naked, made jerking movements with their arms, eyes rolled back. Others groaned and clutched onto fire hydrants to try to stay upright. Witnesses said the scene was like The Walking Dead . Headlines claimed that people had turned into \"zombies,\" while police said that the 33 affected were lucky to be alive.\\nThe case went to the Department of Homeland Security and the Drug Enforcement Agency. They knew who to call to get a second opinion. They packed blood and urine samples on dry ice and shipped them to a small lab 3,000 miles away in San Francisco, run by toxicologist Roy Gerona . If anyone in the country could figure out what was in 24 Karat Gold, it would be him.\\nThe first patient tested was a 28-year-old man who was slow to respond, but otherwise showed few clear signs of trauma. Heart sounds: normal. Blood count: normal. His lungs were clear and there were no major neurological problems, no excessive sweating or skin lesions. He tested negative for opiates, cocaine, amphetamines. Nothing came up.\\nDesigner drugs are volatile. If you tweak just one molecule, you can get an entirely differently substance, one you hadn\\'t bargained for. They\\'re also easy to get. There\\'s no shortage of \"research chemicals\" vendors on the dark web are willing to sell. And they\\'re growing more popular. These so-called \"novel psychoactive substances\" entered the mainstream in 2009. That year, according to the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime , there were about 100 of these substances reported; six years later, there were nearly 500. Because designer drugs don\\'t show up on traditional drug tests, they\\'re hard to track and identify. It\\'s a public health problem that requires a special set of skills to handle.\\nForty years ago, drugs had easy names: cocaine, meth, heroin. Today, the names can read like an ingredients list for a chemistry class: 5F-AMB, PX-2, MDMB-CHMINACA. Today\\'s designer drugs are made by synthesizing chemicals and hoping they give you a high that\\'s strong enough to be worth it, but not strong enough to send you to the hospital.\\nOne of the most prominent categories of designer drugs are those intended to mimic marijuana, called synthetic cannabinoids. Marijuana, or cannabis, is widely considered one of the safest drugs, but synthetic cannabinoids are some of the most dangerous synthetic drugs. The Global Drug Survey (GDS) found that last year, for the fourth year running, the risk of seeking emergency medical treatment was higher after using synthetic weed than for any other drug.\\nWhen you smoke a regular joint, a chemical called tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) travels through your blood. It binds with receptors called CB1 and CB2. Because of the structure, there\\'s \"kind of a limit on how stoned you can get,\" says Adam Winstock, a London-based psychiatrist who administers the GDS. If you\\'re smoking a popular cannabinoid like K2 Spice, a chemical travels through your blood, but this time, it\\'s not THC. It\\'s something else that also binds with CB1 and CB2 — but unlike with regular weed, we don\\'t know exactly how these chemicals bind, especially when they\\'re illicit drugs from the black market. This mystery makes synthetic marijuana likely to lead to \"much more extreme responses,\" like seizures and psychosis, according to Winstock.\\nSynthetic cannabinoids originated in a quest to create a better pain medication. A Clemson University chemist named John W. Huffman synthesized hundreds of compounds in an attempt to find a better painkiller, but often created incredibly psychoactive substances with no medicinal properties at all. When he published the results of these compounds — called JWH compounds, after his initials — he made the information available to be copied.\\nThere are more than 300 JWH compounds alone, and around 2004, labs in China began studying old research papers, synthesizing the compounds and distributing them as \"herbal incense\" products. K2 Spice itself — often partly based off the JWH-018 compound — started in China, became popular in Germany around 2008, and entered the US around 2009.\\nLabs can also turn to the expired patents — patents that are rich fodder, even if (or perhaps because) there was a good reason said drugs never made it to market. It\\'s nearly impossible to figure out how to shut down the overseas labs producing these drugs. As soon as you ban one substance, the labs move on to another.\\nGerona, a toxicologist with gray hair styled in an undercut, was the one who received the biological samples from the DEA. From a small lab in the Medical Sciences Building at the University of California, San Francisco, Gerona says he and his team are playing a \"cat and mouse game\" with illicit international drug manufacturers. When an overdose happens, Gerona\\'s team tries to identify the drug in question — often synthetic substances no one has seen before. But the lab goes one further: Gerona\\'s lab attempts to identify and classify these substances before the mass overdoses even happen.\\nInside, the lab is meticulously neat: rows of spotless tables are covered in bottles with orange rubber caps, all labeled with orange duct tape, and small gray centrifuges. A window overlooking a courtyard has molecular structures scribbled over it in pink and green marker. Near the door sits an enormous freezer, filled with thousands of brightly colored, frost-covered boxes of drug samples kept at -112 degrees Fahrenheit.\\nGerona launched his toxicology lab in 2010, in partnership with the San Francisco Poison Control Center. The date wasn\\'t a coincidence; he says that 2010 was the year that a designer drug called \"bath salts\" began flooding the market. \"Bath salts\" is a blanket term for a group of designer drugs made from stimulants; they create a euphoric high like MDMA, sometimes with hallucinations thrown in. The drugs usually come in powdered and capsule form, and can cause freak-outs that were well-documented on YouTube at the time. The most famous of these was a viral story of a 31-year-old Miami resident attacking and then eating a homeless man. (Scientists dispute the drugs\\' role.)\\nFor users and the DEA, the spike in bath salts use was a nightmare. For Gerona, the increased interest in designer drugs led to more work and more samples from around the country. Eventually, the lab caught the notice of both Michael Schwartz, a toxicologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and DEA pharmacologist Jordan Trecki. A collaboration between Gerona\\'s lab and the DEA was formed. (Neither the DEA nor the CDC responded to repeated requests for comment.)\\nThe first step in doing an analysis at Gerona\\'s lab is getting the sample — urine, blood or, rarely, a tiny bit of drug itself — shipped over on dry ice. In traditional drug testing, you check to see if the sample matches any of the known substances: marijuana, heroin, cocaine, and so on. They match, or they don\\'t. Designer drugs, almost by definition, are made of chemical combinations we haven\\'t seen before. They almost never match traditional databases, and the chemists often don\\'t know what they\\'re looking for. So Gerona\\'s lab gathers as much information about the substance as possible.\\nA tiny vial of the biological sample — usually plasma, the colorless part of blood — goes into a bulky, printer-like machine. That machine is called a liquid chromatography mass spectrometer, and very crudely put, it separates out all the different parts of the plasma by mass. (Think of it like an extremely sensitive centrifuge.) That process makes it easier to identify chemicals, and the mass spectrometer then spits out the different measurements in a computer chart with peaks and valleys called a chromatogram.\\nThen, says Axel Adams, a graduate student in Gerona\\'s lab, you turn to the so-called \"prophetic library.\"\\n\" RESEARCHES LOOK FOR POSTS ABOUT DRUGS ON SUBREDDITS LIKE R/RESEARCHCHEMICALS\\n\"\\nGerona\\'s \"prophetic library,\" about three years in the making, is a detailed catalog of already synthesized variants that his team believes is going to be the next big street drug. The library was made possible with the help of Samuel Banister, a synthetic chemist at Stanford University. Banister synthesizes variants of popular street drugs and takes down their chemical information to create \"reference standards.\" Synthesizing can take anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks; the lab now has almost 150 variants on file. It\\'s a side job for Banister, but at one point, he says, \"I was pumping out five to 10 a week.\" The final products look like white crystalline solids and are kept in drawers in the lab, ready for when a case like AK-47 24 Karat Gold comes along.\\nIn addition, lab members spend hours each week on drug forums, researching trends. It\\'s more of an art than a science. Researches look for posts about drugs on subreddits like r/researchchemicals. They reference surveys like the Global Drug Survey and survey \"trip reports\" from experiential documentation sites like Erowid and PsychonautWiki.\\nThey look for terms like synthetic pot, K2, Spice, and sometimes, scientific terms like \"cannabinoids,\" or a specific popular class of cannabinoids, like \"FUBINACA\" or \"JWH compounds.\" Often, the posts themselves will include the name of the chemical. Gerona has ordered drugs off the dark web. In one case, the invoice billed him for \"cosmetics,\" and the package included lipstick, fake eyelashes, and tabs labeled \"powder.\" The \"powder,\" unsurprisingly, turned out to be drugs. But most of the time, the drugs in the powder were not the drug that was ordered.\\n\" THE INVOICE BILLED HIM FOR \"COSMETICS,\" AND THE PACKAGE INCLUDED LIPSTICK, FAKE EYELASHES, AND TABS LABELED \"POWDER\"\\n\"\\nIf there is a match because the compound is already in the library, finding the right variant is \"only going to take 15 minutes,\" says Gerona. \"Otherwise, it could take a week, or it could not be solved.\"\\nAdams checked the results of a blood sample tied to AK-47 24 Karat Gold against the prophetic library. The computer pulled up a chart that indicated a line — jagged, up and down — that shows the mass of the components of AK-47 24 Karat Gold, versus the same information for AMB-FUBINACA.\\nDrugs don\\'t pass through the body untouched. Once they\\'re ingested, the body processes the compounds. So by the time they\\'re in the blood or urine, it\\'s not exactly the same compound as the drug that was ingested. It\\'s hard enough to find a reference standard for the original compound; it\\'s even more difficult to find a reference standard for the possible variants. In the case of AMB-FUBINACA, the chemical in the biological sample from Brooklyn wasn\\'t the parent compound. It was a derivative. Luckily, Banister had already synthesized that variant, too.\\nThe peaks and valleys of the two lines of AK-47 24 Karat Gold and AMB-FUBINACA matched up precisely. It took the team only seven days to identify the substance in the Brooklyn case — and most of that time was spent waiting for the sample to get there.\\nGerona\\'s lab has worked on cases across the country, from New York City to Sacramento to Colorado. The number of cases varies. Sometimes, they\\'ll get 15 to 25 samples a month. One Mississippi case involving synthetic cannabinoids resulted in over 400 samples. The average turnaround on results is about six months, says Adams. That\\'s not good enough for Gerona.\\nAnd it\\'s not likely that the problem will go away. Marijuana legalization advocates claim that people will stop with the synthetic stuff once the real thing is okay. But that\\'s not true in the experience of Andrew Monte, a clinical toxicologist at the University of Colorado School of Medicine who collaborates with Gerona\\'s lab. Recreational marijuana is legal in Colorado, but he sees patients who are on these synthetic compounds anyway. Monte\\'s team has surveyed people who come into the ER and even set up at music festivals to ask attendees questions. Synthetic drug users are \"taking it for a different reason, to get a different high,\" Monte says. \"They\\'re really looking for something different than what pot gives, the same way you might choose cocaine over pot or meth over pot.\"\\n\" ONE MISSISSIPPI CASE INVOLVING SYNTHETIC CANNABINOIDS RESULTED IN OVER 400 SAMPLES\\n\"\\nTo help address this problem, in 2016 Gerona started a new research consortium called P SCAN, or the Psychoactive Surveillance Consortium and Analysis Network. (Yes, the double entendre is intended.) They\\'re working with about 10 poison control centers in places like Kansas and Colorado. They\\'ve had more than 100 cases referred to them and are writing up case reports and manuscripts. (The 24 Karat Gold case was published by the New England Journal of Medicine.)\\nP SCAN will continue to do the surveillance work Gerona has been doing for years, but also create a database of clinical data connected to the specific synthetic drugs they track and discover. Think of it like a medical version of Erowid. This way, the next time there\\'s an outbreak like the one in Brooklyn, investigators and researchers can look at specific physical indicators (heart rate, respiratory information, neurological information, and more) and say, \"Ah, this matches the symptoms of AMB-FUBINACA\" — all without shipping samples across the country.\\nBut even with P SCAN and the prophetic library, the task is huge. \"The identity of a lab needs to constantly expand and rework in order for it to stay relevant,\" says Gerona.\\nGerona is a biochemist by training. Before launching his lab, he didn\\'t know anything about Spice, or AK-47 Gold, or the dark net. But now, Gerona says, \"I have no other choice but to really learn about it, so that I am relevant and retain my relevance in the field.\" He\\'s hoping to work with people in technology to automate this \"market research\" to glean new insights and make the prediction process even faster. \"It would be so great if we could predict the drugs coming in with more accuracy, instead of after people are hurt,\" he says.\\nWeeding out designer drugs is a Sisyphean task, Gerona admits. It may be impossible to shut down the overseas labs, but he wants to have even better methods for predicting what\\'s going to get big and then, instantly identifying the substances. He compares the endless drug variations to nature: the cold virus is still around because it changes all the time. HIV has never been cured because it continues mutating. \"In a sense, they\\'re reinventing themselves all the time, so reinvention is key to persistence. As long as you\\'re reinventing yourself, you can persist.\\nDr. Michael Rubino is a psychotherapist with over 20 years experience treating teenagers.

       " 'NEW DELHI: The government plans to tweak a provision that allows new medicines developed by foreign companies to be exempt from price control for five years after criticism that it goes against the Make in India policy and discourages local drug manufacturers The Department of Pharmaceuticals and the National Pharmaceuticals Pricing Authority are in discussions about revisiting paragraph 32 of the Drugs (Price Control) Order of 2013, which lists out the exemptions, people aware of the matter told ET.The government broadened the five-year exemption from price control for new foreign drugs patented in India through an amendment in January 2019. The amendment removed a requirement that the drugs should have been developed through indigenous R&D. This included orphan drugs used to treat rare medical conditions.Senior officials in the Department of Pharmaceuticals said the move was aimed at giving Indian patients access to drugs that are available only abroad.However, domestic drug makers and civil rights activists criticised the amendment and complained of high prices and unequal treatment. Experts said the move went against the government’s Make in India policy because it discourages Indian companies from developing and producing patented drugs. The government would also be helpless in an emergency, they said.“The move will restrict the government from putting expensive drugs under price control, regardless of a public health emergency. Most likely, it would encourage foreign pharmaceutical companies to manufacture and commercialise their new patented drugs and medical devices in India,” said a pharma expert.The National Pharmaceuticals Pricing Authority also faces the problem of companies launching products and excluding them from the price control regime without first applying for exemption.“The companies have tried to utilise it and the government is fighting cases in the court with these companies. The government should scrap this amendment as it has only helped multinationals to launch their products at exorbitant prices by claiming that they are patented products,” another expert said.',\n",

When a small portion is distributed in small vials in cities and metros in the State, the large chunk is exported to the Gulf using naive Malayali passengers. Some of the carriers were found to have opted for it out of their dire necessity for money.\\n“Pickle bottles and thick clothes are being used for smuggling out hashish oil. They cleverly hide the drug in such a way as to escape detection by scanners,” said Assistant Excise Commissioner B. Venugopala Kurup. Hashish oil is quite thick and therefore can be neatly laid out in thin layer with a plastic covering.\\nThe inner layers of clothes are often used for smuggling this drug, which costs a minimum ₹2 lakh a kg in the State and procures ten times or more in the Gulf.\\n“We have found that a strong and organised drug mafia is functioning with deep connections in countries such as Bahrain and Kuwait,” said Excise Deputy Commissioner V.P.

Hepatitis C virus is transmitted through needlestick injuries, organ transplant from a carrier, sexually or from infected mother to fetus. Globally, hepatitis C virus exists in six distinct forms based on its genotypes amongst which Type 1 is the most common form representing around 60 -70 per cent of global infections. Hepatitis C is diagnosed by blood tests for estimating viral load and genotyping, and liver damage tests such as magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), transient elastography, and liver biopsy. Antiviral drugs, which inhibits protease or polymerase enzyme of virus is one of the treatments available for infection caused due to hepatitis C. Currently, no vaccines are available for the prevention of hepatitis C virus and this provides scope for the market players to expand their company portfolio.Ask for detailed Sample of the Research Report:Hepatitis C drug market TaxonomyBy Drug ClassHepatitis C Virus Protease InhibitorGlecaprevirGrazoprevirParitaprevirSimeprevirVoxilaprevirNucleoside/tide Polymerase InhibitorsSofosbuvirNS5A InhibitorsDaclatasvirElbasvirLedipasvirOmbitasvirPibrentasvirVelpatasvirNon-Nucleoside Polymerase InhibitorsDasabuvirInterferonCombinational drugBy Distribution ChannelHospital PharmaciesRetail PharmaciesOnline PharmaciesHepatitis C drug market DriverAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2017, around 71 million people were infected by chronic hepatitis C worldwide. Furthermore, WHO considers Eastern Mediterranean and European regions to be the most affected regions with the prevalence rate of 2.3% and 1.5% respectively. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, around 2.7 million to 3.9 million people in the U.S. suffer from hepatitis C. This increasing prevalence of hepatitis C will drive growth of hepatitis C drug market. Furthermore, this blood- borne virus is easily transmitted by sharing injection equipment, transfusion of infectious blood, sexually or from infected mother to infant, which will further propel growth of hepatitis C drug market.Have a doubt? Speak to our analyst now! https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/insight/talk-to-analyst/1489 The governmental initiatives for patients to receive expanded drug coverage is also expected to drive growth of the market. For instance, in 2018, the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care of Ontario announced that all patients are eligible for Ontario Drug Benefit (ODP) irrespective of severity of their disease. In the same year, Thunder Bay group, HIV / AIDS / hepatitis C education and support services provider, expanded its access to medicines, as a result of successful negotiations between the provinces and drug manufacturers.There are significant number of drugs available for Hepatitis C over the past few years and is expected to increase over the forecast period due to large number of drugs in pipeline. Hepatitis C drug market is revolutionized by direct acting antivirals (DAAs), which aid in the development of highly effective, INF-free hepatitis C drug regimen in contrast to standard treatment. The pipeline consists of dual as well as triple DDA combinational therapy against hepatitis C virus. A combination of drugs is more effective for the treatment of hepatitis C as compared to single regimen. For instance, in 2016, Gilead submitted a new drug application to the U.S. FDA for the fixed-dose combination SOF/VEL/voxilaprevir for treatment of HCV genotypes 1–6. Moreover, in January 2017, EMA granted assessment of SOF/VEL/voxilaprevir combination. Furthermore, in 2017, the U.S. FDA approved AbbVie’s Mavyret, a combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir for the treatment of hepatitis C. Hepatitis C drug market is hindered due to high medication cost and denial for Medicaid patients.Hepatitis C Drug MarketThe major players in hepatitis C drug market include Merck & Co.

       " '1 War on drugs: Nearly 50 people suspected of using and selling drugs were killed by officers in the past two months, the Philippine National Police said Friday, contradicting earlier pronouncements that the government’s war on drugs would become less deadly. The figure was the first released since President Rodrigo Duterte reactivated the police in December as the country’s lead agency in carrying out a crackdown on illegal narcotics. Duterte temporarily placed the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency in charge of the drug war last year after police officers were found to have killed three teenagers and then lied about how the boys died. News of their deaths prompted protests and a Senate investigation. The number of people killed since Duterte’s drug war took effect in 2017 is unknown. The government says fewer than 4,000 suspects, but Human Rights Watch last week estimated the figure at more than 12,000.\\n2 London attack: A man who drove a van into worshipers near a London mosque, killing one man and injuring a dozen others, was sentenced Friday to at least 43 years in prison for what a judge called a crime driven by “malevolent hatred.” Judge Bobbie Cheema-Grubb said Darren Osborne’s mind was “poisoned” by far-right ideas before the June 2017 attack targeting Muslims and that he had shown no signs of remorse.

       " \"Alcohol and Other Drugs\\nWesleyan University prides itself on being a community of responsible citizens. To this end, it is expected that members of the community will abide by Wesleyan policies and local laws.\\nWe recognize that despite these laws, expectations, and standards, some people will illegally consume or possess alcohol or other drugs, and some will have medical, legal, and/or interpersonal problems as a result of their use. Moreover, even those of legal age may misuse alcohol and in so doing come into conflict with standards of community conduct.\\nIt is therefore the purpose of this document to delineate clearly the University policy on alcohol and other drugs. This includes the University’s regulations and many relevant laws, information regarding substance-free events, resources for those who have or are concerned about problems related to alcohol or drug use, and clarification about potential outcomes if found in violation of the University policy.\\nStandards of Conduct\\nThe University prohibits the underage and unlawful possession, use, or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol by students or by employees on University property or while participating in any University-sponsored activity. The University will impose disciplinary sanctions on students and employees who violate the standards. Disciplinary sanctions that may be imposed on students include warning, disciplinary probation, community service hours, suspension, and dismissal. The University may also require a student who violates these standards to participate in a program of rehabilitation. Whenever the University determines that a student has violated one of the standards, it will consider as a possible sanction referral of the matter to law enforcement officials for prosecution. Although sanctions will vary according to the specific circumstances of the case, and greater or lesser sanctions imposed depending on these circumstances, it is nonetheless important for students to understand the potential consequences of violating the University’s policies on drugs and alcohol.\\nFinancial Aid Eligibility: A student who has been convicted of any offense under federal or state law involving the possession or sale of a controlled substance will not be eligible to receive certain grants, loans, or work assistance from the time of conviction through a period of ineligibility. The Office of the Dean of Students will monitor and report any known conviction to the Office of Financial Aid.\\nThe Community Standards Board has Provided the Following Information Related to Typical Sanctions for Students:\\nFirst Offense: For minor violations, the student may receive a disciplinary warning via a simplified procedure (pursuant to Section III. D. 3 of the Code of Non-Academic Conduct). For serious violations, the student may receive more severe sanctions.\\nSecond Offense: The student may receive a period of disciplinary probation and an educational assignment. As permitted by the 1998 Reauthorization of Higher Education Act, Wesleyan may notify parents by letter when a student is placed on disciplinary probation as a result of an alcohol/drug policy violation (generally this occurs as a result of a second offense or serious first offense).\\nThird Offense: If such an offense occurs during the probationary period, the student may be suspended for at least one semester. If the offense occurs after the probationary period, the student may receive an extended period of disciplinary probation, an educational assignment, and community service.\\nLocal, State, and Federal Legal Sanctions\\nNumerous local, state, and federal laws govern the possession, use, and distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol. The following is a brief overview of those laws. This overview cannot be an exhaustive or definitive statement of the various laws, but rather is designed to indicate the types of conduct that are against the law and the range of applicable legal sanctions. It is important to note that, while the activities covered by state, local, and federal law and those covered by Wesleyan’s rules are largely the same, the laws and the rules operate independently and do not substitute for each other. Wesleyan may pursue enforcement of its rules whether or not legal proceedings are under way or in prospect, and it may use information from third-party sources, such as law enforcement agencies and the courts, to determine whether University rules have been broken. The University will make no attempt to shield members of the Wesleyan community from the law.\\nLocal Laws\\nAlcohol Use of Alcoholic Beverages Prohibited (see Middletown Code of Ordinances, 18–9) The possession and/or drinking of alcoholic beverages, including, but not limited to, wine and beer, by any person on any city-owned property under the jurisdiction of the Parks and Recreation Department of the city of Middletown shall be prohibited, except that the possession and/or drinking of wine and/or beer shall be allowed in posted areas and at posted times, or by permit, at Veterans Memorial Park, Area A, and Crystal Lake.

Indeed, national data shows that approximately 80 percent of college students drink alcohol, and approximately 1,800 college-age students die each year from alcohol-related injuries. Alcohol use on college campuses plays a direct role in several other harms, such as academic problems, physical assault, sexual assault, and unsafe sex. Wesleyan is especially concerned with high-risk drinking because of the associated harms to the individual and the community and as such has defined high-risk drinking for educational and judicial procedures.\\nWesleyan University's Definition of High-Risk Drinking\\nNationwide studies have defined high-risk drinking, or “binge drinking,” as four drinks for women and five drinks for men in a sitting at least once in a two-week period. However, the actual level at which this occurs can vary between individuals. The behavioral definition of high-risk drinking refers to drinking in a way that compromises the health, well-being, or safety of the individual or others, defies law and University policies, or disrespects the Wesleyan University community. The participation in a behavior listed in any of the categories below qualifies as engagement in high-risk drinking.\\nCompromising One’s Own Health and Well-Being\\nBeing dangerously intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol or drugs leading to: A diminished ability to walk or stand Vomiting Loss of consciousness Verbal or cognitive incoherence Aggressive or violent behavior Intentionally mixing alcohol or drugs together when such use is contraindicated, including excessive amounts of caffeine Consuming an excessive quantity in a short amount of time Chugging Shots Utilization of a high-volume drinking apparatus Pregaming or prepartying Not knowing what is in your glass or leaving it unattended Drinking as an excuse for sexual activities Defying Law and University Policies Operating a vehicle after drinking or riding with an intoxicated driver Causing or coercing another person to ingest alcohol or any drug without that person’s consent Attempting to purchase or purchasing, possessing, or otherwise having control of alcoholic beverages under the age of 21 Non-compliance with the requirements of the Student Events Policy by a student organization Disrespecting the Wesleyan University Community Possessing an open container of alcoholic beverage in public/common areas or on the grounds of the University, except at registered events Engaging in hazardous or disruptive conduct, which may include: Engaging in games or other potentially dangerous behaviors or encouraging others to do so\\nDamaging or destroying University property or another person’s property\\nEngaging in physically or verbally abusive behavior\\nHealth Risk Associated with Illicit Drug Use\\nSimilar to alcohol, someone who uses illicit drugs on a regular basis is at increased risk for experiencing negative consequences (see “Risks Associated with Alcohol Use,” above). These consequences can vary greatly depending on the substance, the quantity consumed, if it is combined with alcohol or other substances, and the frequency of consumption. Some consequences may include the following:\\nMental and physical health problems, including lowered resistance to disease/illness; increased risk of ulcers, heart disease, and cancers of the liver, mouth, throat and stomach; and memory loss, anxiety disorders, phobias, and depression. Increased risk of serious injury to self or others, due to fighting, sexual assault, driving under the influence, homicide, and suicide. Increased likelihood of engaging in unprotected/unsafe sex, due to impaired judgment which may result in unplanned pregnancy and/or infection with a sexually transmitted disease. Increased engagement in other illegal activities, including vandalism, physical assault, sexual assault, driving under the influence, etc. Increased likelihood of developing an addiction, particularly those with a family history of alcohol or other drug addiction. They are at least four times more likely to develop an addiction. Increased likelihood of death. Drug use increases the odds of death from accidental or intentional drug overdoses as well as participation in other unsafe behaviors (e.g., driving under the influence).\\nDrugs, by definition, impact the body’s physiologic processes by chemical means. These interactions may be unpredictable, especially when the constituents of drugs are partially unknown (as with street or club drugs), or of unexpected intensity as when prescription drugs are misused. Such effects are especially problematic when drugs are mixed or combined with alcohol or with other prescription or herbal medications a student may be taking.\\nAt best, such an outcome is frightening or uncomfortable; at worst it could lead to unintended effects as detailed above. In addition to these risks, there is the possibility of addiction to behavior patterns or physical addiction, both of which can yield devastating impacts on family, finances, health, etc.\\nThe chart “Controlled Substances—Uses and Effects” (https://www.dea.gov/factsheets ) provide additional information on the uses and effects of controlled substances.\\n(Information adapted from McDowell, U. and Futris, T., “Adolescents at Risk: Illicit Drug Use.” Department of Human Development and Family Science, The Ohio State University, 2002; and C. Kuhn, S. Swartzwelder and W. Wilson, “Buzzed: The straight facts about the most used and abused drugs from alcohol to ecstasy,” 1998.)\\nAlcohol and Other Drug Prevention and Education for Students\\nWesWell, the Office of Health Education | 287 High Street | 860-685-2466 | wesleyan.edu/weswell\\nWesWell, the Office of Health Education, coordinates alcohol and other drug prevention education activities. These efforts consist of educational outreach activities with the goal of informing and educating the Wesleyan community about the use and abuse of alcohol and other drugs. The program is aimed at creating an environment on campus in which responsible choices about alcohol and drug use are supported. Please visit wesleyan.edu/weswell/resources to see a comprehensive list of strategies. Some strategies include:\\nThe Director of Health Education hires a team of student Peer Health Advocates who create peer-led outreach activities on a range of health issues, including alcohol and other drugs. They design and disseminate a variety of activities and materials and assist the Director and Alcohol and Other Drug Specialist in planning prevention activities. The health education staff offers programs during New Student Orientation and residentially based workshops throughout the year, and sponsors awareness events and speakers. The health education staff supports students referred for educational follow-up as a result of alcohol and other drug policy violations. This may be a one-on-one meeting with the Alcohol or Other Drug Specialist or participation in a web-based program. The Director of Health Education and Alcohol and Other Drug Specialist conduct Residence Life student staff training and in-services, assists with event staff training, and supports the training needs of other departments and groups on alcohol and other drug issues. The Director of Health Education and Alcohol and Other Drug Specialist serve as a resource and an advisor to students who opt to live in alcohol- and drug-free housing and to students in recovery from alcohol and other drugs.\\nAlcohol and Other Drug Intervention and Support\\nIdentification, Intervention, and Referral of students with substance abuse problems\\nHealth Services and other Student Affairs and Deans’ Office staff are trained to identify students who may have substance- abuse problems and can intervene, if appropriate, to refer these individuals to Health Education, Counseling and Psychological Services, and/or to a local treatment center for assessment and treatment, if necessary. Twelve-step support meetings are available on campus and within walking distance of campus. For a list of campus meetings please visit: wesleyan.edu/weswell. The Residential Life student staff and the Peer Health Advocates may also refer students to the Office of Health Education, Health Services, and Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) for problems with alcohol and other drugs. Additionally, students who violate the University’s Alcohol and Other Drugs Policy may be referred by the Community Standards Board (CSB) to meet with staff in Health Services, Office of Health Education, and/or Counseling Center for an evaluation/assessment or ongoing therapy. Ongoing Support for Students in Recovery\\nProfessionals are available in the Counseling and Psychological Services for ongoing counseling and support. Twelve-step support meetings are available within on-campus and within walking distance of campus. For a current list of campus meetings and locations please visit: wesleyan.edu/weswell.\\nAlcohol and Drug Counseling and Treatment for Students\\nDavison Health Center, 327 High Street | 860-685-2470, wesleyan.edu/healthservices\\nThe Davison Health Center serves as an important point of first contact for many students. The Health Center staff are well-attuned to the direct and indirect effects of alcohol and other drugs on students’ lives and factor this in virtually every clinical encounter. Educating and advising students on the use of alcohol and other drugs will occur directly when medical history or exam suggest that their use may be having an impact on physical, academic, or social functioning and indirectly as when students are advised to avoid alcohol use to promote recovery from a viral illness. When necessary, students are referred to the Counseling and Psychological Services.\\nCounseling and Psychological Services | 860-685-2910, wesleyan.edu/caps\\nCounseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) is located in the Davison Health Center. CAPS sees students who self-refer for alcohol and/or substance issues, as well as students who are referred by other offices and members of the University community. CAPS also assists students who are returning to campus following intensive treatment for alcohol or drug abuse or dependence. CAPS provides consultation and referral, voluntary psychotherapy, and support for returning students.\\nConsultation and Referral\\nA student with questions about his or her substance or alcohol use can schedule an appointment with a CAPS therapist to discuss these concerns in detail. At the end of the session, the therapist will make a recommendation for treatment, which could range from individual psychotherapy at CAPS to outpatient treatment at a specialized program to inpatient rehabilitation. Voluntary Psychotherapy\\nIf appropriate, a student may see a CAPS therapist for individual psychotherapy to address concerns regarding alcohol and/or substance use. Alternatively, a student may benefit from seeing a therapist in the community who specializes in this area. CAPS can assist students with these referrals. Finally, a student’s use pattern may be significant enough to warrant intensive outpatient treatment, such as that provided by Rushford Treatment Center in Middletown. CAPS can facilitate this referral as well. Support for Returning Students\\nAt times, students determine they need time off from Wesleyan in order to fully address their alcohol and/or substance issues. As they prepare to return to the campus community following completion of their treatment, CAPS will meet with students to discuss potential challenges and to develop a plan for a successful transition back to the life of a full-time student.\\nPolicy Review\\nThe University will review the Alcohol and Other Drugs Policy at least every two years to assess its effectiveness and ensure that disciplinary sanctions are consistently enforced. Changes in the policy will be implemented as needed following each review.\",\n",

       " 'This article is a collaboration between MedPage Today and:\\nNEW ORLEANS -- Real-world data from the Mayo Clinic confirmed that biologic therapies reduce asthma exacerbations and the need for steroids in patients with severe, refractory, oral steroid-dependent asthma, according to a study presented here.\\nThese patients experienced an average of four exacerbations in the 12 months before switching to mepolizumab (Nucala) or benralizumab (Fasenra), which dropped to one exacerbation in the year after starting on one of these biologic agents (P=0.002), reported Dayne Voelker, MD, of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.\\nAnd the median dose of prednisone dropped from 20 mg in the 6 months before starting the biologic to 5 mg in the 6 months after (P=0.001), according to the findings presented at CHEST 2019.\\n\"Most of the literature we have on these drugs is from phase III drug approval trials,\" Voelker told MedPage Today. \"There hasn\\'t been a lot of follow-up to tell us what is going on with their real-world use, where patients aren\\'t carefully selected based on a set of inclusion or exclusion criteria.\"\\nBiologics now approved for the treatment of asthma include the IL-4 and IL-13 inhibitor dupilumab (Dupixent); the IL-5 receptor antagonists benralizumab, mepolizumab, and reslizumab (Cinqair); and omalizumab (Xolair), an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody that targets IgE.\\nIn one of the first studies to assess the efficacy of biologic drugs for severe asthma outside the clinical trial setting, Voelker\\'s group conducted a retrospective chart review of electronic medical records for all severe asthma patients treated with biologics from January 2016 to December 2018 at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester.\\nThe study included data on 50 asthma patients treated with biologic therapies for 6 months or more (42 with mepolizumab and 8 with benralizumab). Key endpoints included asthma exacerbations, prednisone dosing, and change in FEV 1 . The median time of oral prednisone use before beginning a biologic therapy was 2 years.\\n\"The data from the phase III clinical trials were strong in these patients, and our data is in line with that,\" Voelker said. \"We show that these medications can be used effectively and efficiently in the real-world setting in the right patient population.\"\\nFEV 1 did not change significantly at 6 and 12 months on biologic therapy, compared to baseline lung function scores. Voelker said the lack of impact on lung function, as measured by FEV 1 , is consistent with the clinical trials data.\\n\"Some individual patients saw big changes, but overall we didn\\'t see a statistical change in FEV 1 ,\" he said.\\nHe added that biologic therapies appear to be most effective in patients with Th2 endotype disease with eosinophil-mediated inflammation.\\n\"In these patients, (biologic) therapies can represent a game changer,\" he said. \"These drugs are expensive, but long-term use of steroids is also detrimental, with lots of side effects. We know that these drugs work in these patients and they lower the need for oral steroids. So, in the long term they may prove cost beneficial.\"',\n",

Why is that? Is it poverty, unemployment, poor rehabilitation services trapping people in their addictions? A look in the doors of our prisons and mental hospitals reveal the wasted lives from drug addictions.\\nSuccessive Westminster governments, which control our drugs laws, have failed to address drugs deaths, drugs laws and the wide range of solutions that could have made a difference.\\nInstead they have stuck with successive American governments\\' policies, blaming the addicts, throwing billions of dollars at prescribing methadone, using police and customs controls as the solution. Nancy Reagan’s failed “just say no to drugs” campaigns, which were then re-marketed as the Scotland Against Drugs campaign, heavily supported by our police and by parents, also failed.\\nIn 1965 I worked with heroin addicts in East Harlem in New York. They had started their methadone programme three years earlier and fast realised it did not work, as it trapped addicts in another addictive drug. Twenty-five years later we adopted this failed approach.\\nThese failed policies were about wishing the drug problem would go away. They failed and have denied addicts the help they need. Our horrendous deaths are of adults, long trapped in their addiction, not children. Almost all of the 1,187 deaths are of people in their late twenties to mid-forties; people who have been failed by underfunded drugs rehabilitation policies and left deprived of appropriate help. Almost all of these addicts have undiagnosed and untreated serious mental health problems, for which we have offered no help. The UK Government has learned nothing from this, and has steadfastly refused to delegate to the Scottish Government the powers it needs in order to develop different solutions to our very different drug problem.\\nDrug problems are still controlled under the Department of Justice, unlike like tobacco and alcohol which are dealt with by the Health Ministry. Drugs misuse is a health problem. We in Scotland have been allowed to develop our own tobacco and alcohol policies. We have in a fairly short time massively lowered the level of smoking. The alcohol problem is reducing by the day and recent reports tells us that children and students are now losing interest in alcohol.\\nOur request for the power to decriminalise illicit drugs has been already with met a big no from Boris Johnson. If we could try decriminalisation as a way to stop wasting millions on police, court and prisons the savings could be put into preventing another cohort of addicts dying needlessly. The UK Government has offered no other workable solutions, so why is it afraid to allow Scotland to lead the way in finding solutions to this massive health scandal?\\nWe tried American solutions – they failed us.\\nWe tried Westminster solutions – they failed us.\\nLet Scotland try its own solutions; we will not let those suffering from addictions and mental health problems down.\\nMax Cruickshank, Glasgow G12.',\n",

       " 'Afghanistan\\nIn times of hardship and war, cultivating opium became a strategy of survival for farmers in Afghanistan. The fact that they have no sense of wrongdoing makes it difficult to draft policies to stall production. By Conrad Schetter\\nPoppy field in Afghanistan\\n\\u200b\\u200bThe opium survey for Afghanistan recently presented by United Nations paints an alarming picture (UNODC, 2004). Last year, it says, the country produced 4,200 metric tons – 87 percent of all opium sold globally.\\nParticularly disturbing is the fact that poppy farming has increased steadily since the Coalition against Terrorism intervened militarily in autumn 2001.\\nOwing to the enormous scale of production, the Afghan government and the international community now regard dismantling of the drug economy as a top priority. As experience in Colombia and the Golden Triangle has shown, however, that is a formidable task. An eradication strategy for Afghanistan is more likely to further destabilise the country than to produce fast, sustainable results.\\nDrugs for export\\nVirtually all the drugs in the country are exclusively produced for export, although a certain amount of opium is traditionally grown for domestic consumption in a few valleys in eastern Afghanistan. With the outbreak of the Soviet-Afghan War in 1979, export-led production acquired a special significance.\\nThe revenues were a valuable source of funding for the Mujaheddin. When the Soviet troops withdrew in 1988 and the country fragmented into innumerable warlord fiefdoms, opium-cultivation increased dramatically. In the 1990s, annual harvests of raw opium averaged 2,000 tons, with the provinces of Hilmand, Nangarhar and Badakshan being the principal growing areas.\\nAside from the total loss of central government control, losses of arable land due to war damage and minefields prompted more and more farmers to plant opium poppies. They had to generate enough income to feed their families from smaller patches of land.\\nUnder the Taliban, who controlled 90 percent of the country in the late 1990s, opium production initially increased. In 1999, the record harvest of 4,600 tons was registered. And whereas in the past raw opium had been processed in neighbouring countries (mostly Pakistan), heroin labs were now set up in Afghanistan.\\nIt remains a mystery why the Taliban abruptly changed their stance and banned opium production in 2000. Maybe this move was part of a market strategy meant to reduce supplies and stabilise prices – or maybe it was prompted by religious dogma. Whatever the motive, the Taliban’s religious networks and draconian penalties succeeded in stopping opium cultivation.\\nThe drug economy went into boom again after the overthrow of the Taliban and the establishment of a transitional government that had little control over the country. Within just three years, farmers were growing opium in every province. Despite drug control programmes, the area under cultivation has increased from 74,000 to 131,000 hectares in the past two years.\\nOpium as the backbone of national economy\\nAlthough less than three percent of arable land is used to grow opium poppies, the crop forms the backbone of the national economy. According to UNODC, opium revenues accounted for 38 percent of GDP (including the shadow economy).\\nFor every dollar of development aid, there is two dollars revenue from the drug economy. But changes in supply and demand cause prices to fluctuate. While opium brought farmers around 1.2 billion dollars in 2003, tumbling prices reduced that income to 600 million in 2004.\\nProducer prices have fallen by nearly two thirds, whereas the profits reaped by dealers in the country – which the UNODC puts at a total of 2.2 billion dollars – have risen by nearly 70 percent. But even after this drop in prices, farmers still earned twelve times more from opium than they would have from cereals.\\nThe drug economy is labour-intensive. According to UN statistics, 2.3 million people in 356,000 families (or around ten percent of the Afghan population) are involved in production activities. Another 15,000 or so people act as dealers, mostly with a limited radius because they have links with only a few farmers.\\nAlthough wholesale trade structures have become established in the province of Nangarhar, there are no drug cartels so far. Even most wholesalers’ scope of action ends at the Afghan border. The profits thus benefit a large number of small traffickers.\\nFarmers have some leeway in the process of price bargaining and opium production, for them, provides opportunities to access informal loans for seed. The main disadvantage is that they grow dependant on dealers, which is hard to reverse.\\nMilitias and warlords also have a stake in the drug trade. Opium farmers pay the warlords a 10 percent levy and dealers pay a kind of road toll for free passage to the villages.\\nAs long ago as spring 2002, the international community declared dismantling the drug economy a key priority. However, the initial impact of relief programmes was to boost opium production. Domestic grain prices plummeted because of wheat imports for needy communities, prompting many farmers to switch to growing opium.\\nThe British-led drug control programme launched in 2002 relied on compensation payments, offering farmers 350 dollars a hectare to destroy their poppy fields. The farmers demanded 3,000 dollars, however, because they had gone into debt in anticipation of high profits. The result was another upturn in opium production.\\nMany farmers pocketed the compensation but then went on to plant new poppy fields in remote areas – not least for the sake of meeting their commitments to drug traffickers.\\nJihad against drugs\\nThe issue of drug control remains high on the international agenda. At the Berlin donor conference last April, President Hamid Karzai called for a jihad against drug cultivation. He has repeatedly stressed since then that the drug economy is the biggest obstacle to Afghanistan’s development.\\nThe US administration, in particular, has recently been pushing for more radical action and has pledged 780 million dollars for drug control in 2005 – 300 million of which for eradication programmes alone. Against Karzai’s explicit wishes, the US government is propagating a large-scale crop-spraying operation to destroy poppy fields with pesticide.\\nAfghan and European officials, on the other hand, prefer a \"carrot and stick\" policy: only if compensation, raising of public awareness and alternative planting programmes fail to make farmers reconsider their crop of choice should draconian measures be taken.\\nIt needs to be remembered that Afghans’ experience of opium growing in the past was largely positive. The plant is ideally adapted to the country’s environment; it is rather undemanding, requires little water and grows almost anywhere.\\nSaffron, rose oil and wild rice – the alternative crops that have been proposed – are much harder to cultivate and nowhere near as profitable. For Badakshan and Uruzgan – two provinces that have always been particularly poor – drug cultivation has brought a modest but visible degree of prosperity.\\nThe evidence is seen in new houses, SUVs and mobile phones. What is more, the gap between rich and poor has not widened particularly as even landless peasants renting fields from landowners profit from the opium economy. The labour-intensive production creates incomes for people with practically no chance of regular employment.\\nAt present, Afghan farmers are not coerced into planting opium poppies by warlords or drug barons. Many, it seems, take the initiative themselves. Moreover, the drug economy is not confined to marginalised or criminalised elements – it pervades the whole of society.\\nMerchants casually trade in drugs as they do, at the same time, in wheat, car tyres and electrical appliances. For many small farmers, growing opium forms as much a part of their survival strategy as growing wheat and barley.\\nState actors, too, profit from the drug economy. Off the record, even Afghan ministers are frequently suspected of being involved in the narcotics business. Afghanistan’s government has begun to destroy drg sapplies.\\nIn Afghanistan, the Western view that growing opium is illegal and immoral still seems exotic to many. Most people are perplexed by – or even hostile to – the opium-growing ban announced by the government in January 2002.\\nThey do not consider the government a relevant authority for deciding on what is legal and what is not. To change the understanding of legitimacy, it would take religious leaders or village elders elaborating on Islamic teachings and tribal traditions. However, these very elites have been encouraging opium production after the fall of the Taliban – sometimes even as a form of jihad against the West.\\nContrary to conventional wisdom, the drug economy has not been a source of real problems in Afghanistan itself. Many local people see it more as a promising sector in a country where economic prospects are otherwise bleak.\\nCertainly, drug farming does have a negative impact on neighbouring countries, where the numbers of addicts are growing. According to the UNODC, Pakistan has half a million heroin addicts and Iran 3.7 million opiate abusers. However, Afghanistan’s neighbours are still primarily transit countries.\\nThe big money is made in Europe and the United States. This is the demand that serves as the incentive for production. So for sustainable progress to be made in the war against drug production, consumption in the industrialised countries needs to be curbed.\\nRisky fight against opium producers\\nStepping up the fight against opium producers in Afghanistan, however, is fraught with inestimable risks. The fragile peace and tentative steps towards national reconstruction would be jeopardised. Public dissatisfaction could quickly spread and be channelled into hostility towards foreigners – from development workers to ISAF troops.\\nThey all would be perceived as agents of the anti-drug campaign. A \"war on drugs\" would also encourage organised crime because many small farmers would make a conscious choice to cultivate opium and secure their livelihoods rather than take their chances by obeying the law.\\nForceful steps against the trade at present would also prompt the formation of drug cartels, which might then coerce farmers into growing opium. On top of all this, there is also an economic dilemma: if production was successfully cut back, the reduction in supply would push up prices on the black market and make growing opium even more lucrative.\\nIn the case of Afghanistan, the international community, therefore, should consider innovative approaches. Legalising the cultivation of the opium poppy and nationalising distribution would certainly be bold and controversial moves – but they could prevent the impending connection between organised crime and opium cultivation.\\nIf the international community insists on fighting drugs at the source, however, it will definitely have to win over the traditional elites. They alone have the authority to stop opium growing and strip the drug economy of its legitimacy.\\nIn this respect, President Karzai has already made some headway by persuading tribal leaders in Nangarhar to endorse a ban on opium growing. In return, Karzai promised development assistance. However, Afghanistan is a country marked by high regional diversity.

The siege at Intercontinental Hotel was on. A cold dread gripped Sadr, a young researcher at the Afghan Institute of Strategic Studies. “I felt my life was under threat. I felt unsafe. And, I felt terror,” he said. Six days later, an ambulance exploded at a spot he had passed by only a few hours earlier. The toll is 100 and counting. “Luck and timing, that saved me,” he said.\\nKabul is one of the most dangerous cities in the world, and every resident here has been exposed to terror, up close and personal. Everyone knows someone who was killed, or maimed, in a blast. Danger takes myriad forms. There is terror. There are bounty hunters, waiting to grab a ransomable prey. They are known to chop off and send bits of fingers and ears to frighten families and employers into paying up. Few have compunctions about bumping off a “worthless” victim. And, then, there are the petty thieves, driven by unemployment or drug addiction, who will kill for a few Afghanis. This is our life, we are inured to it, say residents.\\nSadr’s resilience has weakened considerably, though. He has returned from a six-year stay in India, and he remembers his erstwhile residence in notorious Gurgaon as a safe haven in comparison with the chaos in Kabul. Sadr has returned with a wife, Rashmi Dangol, from Nepal, whom he met while studying at the South Asian University in Delhi. Rashmi—who got a job at the Afghanistan Centre at Kabul University before him, and happily joined her in-laws months before he moved back—seems to have adjusted rather well to Kabul. Sadr is wracked with fear, misgivings and guilt. This was his hell; has he jeopardised Rashmi’s life, too?\\nThere are fresh intelligence alerts that Kabul University is a probable target and that foreign employees are under great threat. In fact, a new alert even warns of possible attacks in shopping areas frequented by foreigners. As with all intelligence warnings, the frustrating bit is that one seldom knows when, and exactly where.\\nBusiness as usual: A bazaar in Kabul.\\nThe security scene in Afghanistan has never been good in living memory, but the deterioration over the past three years is particularly worrisome. Ever since the US began withdrawing forces, matters have been spiralling downwards. “The T-walls are getting higher, the number of soft skin cars fewer,” said Noorjehan Mawani, diplomatic representative of the Aga Khan Development Network to Afghanistan.\\nThe streets of Kabul are a maze of concrete barricades. There are T-walls, which are portable, steel-reinforced concrete blast walls that are 12-foot high. It is said the new 20-foot ones cost a thousand dollars apiece. At the more vulnerable areas, the police have set up “rings of steel”. Entry to government buildings and hotels are complicated processes, involving narrow openings between barricades, and numerous checks through metal detectors and security rooms made of four-inch thick, bomb-proof metal.\\nA parade of uniforms are on display everywhere—each police, military and private security personnel wielding nothing less than a lethal Kalashnikov. Showrooms for armoured cars have opened, and vehicles of the National Directorate of Security, the country’s premier intelligence arm, patrol the roads. Up in the sky floats a giant balloon, which local people say, is for surveillance.\\nNone of these measures have lulled the city into feeling safe. The more the security, the worse the attack. Like the powerful truck bomb that went off near the German embassy last May, killing 150 and injuring more than 400. The city is studded with damaged buildings that no one has had the energy, or money, to rebuild.\\nEnforcing order: A policeman waving children away from a secure area in Kabul.\\nThe latest attack on the military academy on January 29, a day that Afghanistan had set aside for national mourning, has left a country inured to mindless violence shellshocked. After the ambulance bomb attack on January 27, Kabul actually turned into a ghost town, as even the most resilient feared to step out. There is not much defence against a fidayeen attack. The suicide bomber is programmed to blow himself up the moment he is caught, never mind that the resultant casualties are not the intended target.\\nThough Taliban claims that it targets “invaders” and government officials, and not civilians (see interview on page 36), collateral damage is high. The January 27 attack is a case in point. “Every day, when I leave home for work, I bid my family farewell as if I may never return. I have no hope of seeing peace in my country,” said Mir Abdul Wahed Hashimi, who works with Internews, a nonprofit organisation that focuses on media solutions and research. “I remember my father listening to BBC Radio 35 years ago, when the Soviets withdrew. He said there would be peace now. Then we heard about the UN representative talking to the Mujahideen, and thought, now we would have peace. Instead, we got Taliban and more war. When technocrats returned, we thought, finally we would have peace. Taliban is still active, and Islamic State has entered Afghanistan. No, I don’t see peace anytime soon.”\\nWinter is usually a time of low terrorist activity, because that is when new recruits are sent to training camps in Pakistan, say local people. This winter has been different, though. There were three massacres in ten days in Kabul, and lethal explosions in Jalalabad, and Kandahar and Herat provinces. The Kabul attacks were so terrible that the nation declared a day of mourning. Sources say the situation will worsen as Afghanistan gets closer to its next general election, due in July this year.\\nThe past three years have dealt multiple blows to the country. Apart from a worsening security situation, Afghanistan’s economy has been hit. With one lakh foreign soldiers gone, ancillary jobs for local people have dried up. The change in fortunes is starkly evident at Bush Bazar (named after the former US president), once a grey market for supplies pilfered from military stores, and hand-me-downs from the barracks. You could buy US army shoes, vests and an assortment of canned food there. Today, the market sells Chinese products.\\nBold and beautiful: Women walk a street in Kabul lined with beauty parlours.\\nThe US now has around 14,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, mostly noncombatants. President Donald Trump’s decision to step up presence again is yet to get rolling. With soldiers departing, several international aid organisations moved out, too, spurring further unemployment. Now, even a labourer’s vacancy attracts throngs of applicants elbowing each other.\\nA country barely able to deal with its injured, has little time or money for dealing with mental problems. Stress levels are high here, but terms like post-traumatic stress disorder are unheard of. Little wonder, then, that heroin addiction is on the rise, further fuelled by unemployment. The Pul-i-Sokhta bridge in Kabul illustrates this crisis. Below it, addicts, dishevelled, dazed and dangerous, smoke and inject themselves, while locals lean over the bridge to watch the horrible sight. Opium cultivation is on the rise in southern provinces like Helmand. Opium funds terror.\\nThere aren’t many statistics to come by in a country where surveys are low priority. But, the upsurge in the out-of-Afghanistan exodus is evident. Sadr remembers his circle of friends, named Giroh-e-guftagu, who used to gather for poetry sessions six years ago. Only a few are still around; most have left for the US or Europe.\\n“I’ve seen couples who were doing well here, leave for menial jobs in the west. It is really sad,” said Rashmi. Those who can, take scholarships abroad, and try to remain there. Others cross over to Iran and then move illegally westwards, seeking asylum in countries like Germany and Sweden. Many are deported; they try again.\\nIntercontinental Hotel, after the January 20 attack.\\nAs if the incessant violence is not bad enough, Afghan society is still cleaved sharply on ethnic lines, with distrust for each other. Pashtuns are the largest ethnic group. Then come Tajiks and Hazaras, followed by at least 12 major groups like Turkman, Uzbek and Khorasan, and even the last of the Sikhs, Hindus and a lone Jew.\\nIn the nascent democratic set up, identity politics plays out in an ugly form. Hazaras are no longer the suppressed people. Their years as refugees in Iran and Pakistan gave them access to education and new ideas. The community is on the upswing—Hazara students are usually the examination toppers. The Tajiks, always a proud and educated people, do not let anyone forget how it was their dominion, Panjsher, which was the frontline of the resistance to Taliban. The only safe road trip from Kabul is to Panjsher. It is a big thing in a country where the government has control over only 60 per cent of the area—the rest is still Taliban territory.\\nThe centre’s tenuous control over the land is well illustrated by Atta Muhammed Noor, who has refused to step down as governor of Balkh province, though all provincial governors were fired when President Ashraf Ghani took over in 2014. An ethnic Tajik, Noor is wealthy and hugely influential. He is also extremely popular, thanks to his good governance. Elsewhere, too, local warlords call the shots.\\nThe proposal to issue a national identity, or Afghan card, has become a vexing issue. The problem is that the word Afghan is interchangeable with Pashtun—something not acceptable to others. “Parliament has now accepted the proposal that after Afghan nationality, the card will also give the person’s ethnicity and religion,” said Anarkali Kaur, a senator in the upper house of parliament.\\nOmar Sadr\\nBut, the matter will not be easily resolved. Because, apart from the main ethnicities, there are several subgroups, cataloguing all of which will seem like a taxonomy chart. “Why can’t we be like India, where so many different people live together, and yet, proudly call themselves Indians,” asked Mina, an undergraduate student at Kabul’s American University.\\nSaid Mawani: “The biggest risk to a country is ethnicisation of politics.” She, however, pointed out that there were two ways of looking at Afghanistan. Admittedly, the security scene is deteriorating, but the country has made progress on several demographic parameters. “Fifteen years ago, there was no concept of a doctor in Bamyan,” she said. “Today, it has an ISO-certified hospital. Kabul’s FMIC hospital even has a neonatal surgical unit and, what’s more, Afghan doctors are now running the show.”\\nMawani said that, in the initial post-Taliban years, the focus was on numbers—school enrolments, for instance. The attention is now gradually shifting to quality, too.\\nIt is a difficult journey for Afghanistan. For every single step it takes towards progress, it is pulled back ten. A new script of geopolitics is playing out in the country, where almost every country in the world wants to have a role. The US, having fought a weary 16-year war, wants out; yet, doesn’t want to be out.\\nGhani said that without American help, the Afghan military would last just six months. Russia feels that engaging with Taliban is the route to peace. For the Afghan people, however, peace and security remain a mirage. Will they ever achieve it? “Peace is a process,” said Kaur. “We are all working towards it. It may take time, but one day, we will get it. Look at Sri Lanka. They managed, didn’t they?”',\n",
       " 'New Delhi [India], July 2 (ANI): The Minister of State in Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Ashwini Kumar Choubey said that there is no definition of \\'generic drugs\\' in the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Drugs & Cosmetics Rules, 1945, on Tuesday in Lok Sabha.\\n\"The quality of drugs imported, manufactured and sold in the country is regulated under the provisions of Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Drugs & Cosmetics Rules, 1945. And there is no definition of generic drugs under these acts\", he said.\\nHe said that the generic medicines are generally those which contain some amount of same active ingredients in same dosage form, and are intended to be administered by the same route of administration as that of branded medicine.\\n\"The medicines, whether branded, generic or branded-generic, imported or manufactured for sale/distribution in the country, are required to comply with the same standards as specified in the Second Schedule to the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940\", the minister said.\\nHe also stated that these medicines are available easily in the country, especially in Delhi. Further, \"Public Health & Hospitals\" being a State subject, the primary responsibility of ensuring the sufficient supply of free medicines is that of respective State Governments.\\nIn an answer on the National Health Mission, Chowbey said, \"Under the National Health Mission, the Central Government supplements the efforts of State Governments to strengthen their healthcare system including for the provision of free essential medicines in public health facilities, based on proposals of the State Governments.\"\\n\"Under the NHM, financial and technical support is provided to the States and Union Territories not only for provision of essential drugs (mostly all generic), free of cost, in public health facilities but also for strengthening or setting up robust systems of procurement, quality assurance mechanism, warehousing, prescription audit, grievance redressal, dissemination of Standard Treatment Guidelines, and IT backed supply chain management systems like Drugs and Vaccines Distribution Management Systems (DVDMS)\" he further added.

Difficulties in sourcing raw materials for certain medicines account for 17% of stock delays, it said.\\nThe open letter read: “The globalisation of the production and demand [of drugs plays a role]. 70% of main active ingredients are made in the USA or Asia, on a small number of sites. One little problem in a factory, and it’s a catastrophe [for everyone else].”\\nOne manufacturer of Parkinson’s drug Sinemet, based in the USA, the letter said, was “forced to close its doors” temporarily to deal with the rising backlog.\\nVaccinations can also pose problems. Due to their being a living, biological product, it can take between 18 and 24 months to produce them, so “when there is a lack of vaccinations, we cannot just replace them the next day”, the letter explained.\\nLaboratories are also reportedly reducing stocks to save costs, and may offer more drugs first to markets that pay higher prices than France. Some labs have stopped producing older medicines, the letter alleged, because their price has been deemed as too low.\\nFrench pharmacist group L'Ordre des Pharmaciens has put an alert system - named DP-Ruptures - in place to help, which is designed to reduce the amount of time that medicines are not available in pharmacies.\\nSimilarly, a Senate report, published at the beginning of October, suggested 30 ways to prevent continued lack of stock.\\nIt recommended that more funding be given to two organisations able to provide essential medicines in France: the central army pharmacy, and the l'Agence Générale des Équipements et Produits de Santé (AGEPS).\\nYet, some specialists say this is not a sustainable option, as the cost is considerable and it can be difficult to choose exactly which medicines are needed as priority.\\nThe report also recommended a “carrot and stick approach”, including financial incentives for pharmaceutical companies that make medicines in France (thus increasing their availability), alongside sanctions for those that do not manage stock scarcity properly.\\nDespite certain delays, members of the public are advised against buying medicines online or from other sources, even for drugs that appear scarce, as ANSM judges the risk of counterfeit and unsafe products to be too great.\\nPhysicians and doctors are advised to seek alternative types of treatment in the event that a specific medicine is not available, although these may also be scarce too, depending on the drug.\",\n",

       " 'FROM time to time this column has carried articles alerting consumers as to the dangers of using expired food and drugs and food and drugs smuggled into the country manufactured by producers of questionable reputation. Sometimes food and drugs are imported from reputable countries but not produced there and never sold in their home markets. This is one of the perils of the Free Market where Guyana’s market is inundated with goods from everywhere.\\nRecently, Dr Shamdeo Persaud, the Chief Medical Officer, found it necessary to again issue a public warning against expired food and drugs. Since he has been Chief Medical Officer, Dr Persaud has ever so often been issuing such timely advisories as consumers have to be constantly reminded of the dangers of expired food and drugs.\\nDr Persaud’s recent warnings have been comprehensive and as such we will quote extensively from his statement::-\\n“The Ministry has been alerting its agencies including the Private Sector that we do not use expired drugs. There is no ‘it expired yesterday so that you could go ahead and take those medications”. A lot of our products are imported in bulk form. We are encouraging that the expiry date is written in the information that is given to the patients so that the patients would know when their supply of drugs would expire”.\\nDr Persaud took care to reiterate some of the requirements of the Law “the Law specifically stipulates that food, pharmaceuticals, medical devices must be labelled in the English language first of all and the labels must cover certain areas. The Food and Drugs Act also stipulates the time of expiry date . . . Any food and drug of expired date must be removed from the shelf and destroyed, not resold to our poorer population or less educated persons and put them at an additional health risk”.\\nFood and drugs are given expiry dates because after those dates, from scientific evidence, such food and drugs, particularly drugs- because ineffectual for the purposes for which they were produced. More importantly – could become toxic, that is poisonous. Ingesting expired drugs could not only cause one’s health to further deteriorate but in extreme cases, cause death.\\nBecause of the shortage of staff and other resources, Dr Persaud and his team are unable to provide the full protection of consumers as they would wish and thus consumers must make their own efforts. In the first place, the consumer must ascertain that he is supplied with the item he intended to purchase and not a substitute or a different product with label resembling it. Then he must check on the expiry date. If the date is altered or removed, then he should not buy the product though it may be offered at a much cheaper price. He must ascertain that the directions are in English and also the country of production. If the buyer cannot read the label, the seller must do so. Finally, the buyer must require a proper bill or receipt for his purchase.\\nThere are other pitfalls of which purchasers must be aware: Consumers must be on the lookout for forgeries which are fairly common on the Guyanese market. These forgeries are mostly imported from East Asia and packed exactly like their Western originals but are usually of lower quality and sell for a cheaper price. Consumers must be wary in particular of buying foods and drugs. Indian pharmaceuticals tend to be of good quality since their Standards organisations are modelled on Western lines and active and also because all the major Western Pharmaceutical companies are established in that country. Pharmaceuticals produced by GPC are done under licence from reputable Western companies and could be safely used.\\nIn buying foods and drugs, consumers are urged to ascertain not only country of production, but the name of the producer. For example, there is a firm in Canada which adopts the well-known product names of companies which have gone out of existence and uses the identical trademarks and labels of the known product; one could see such products as sardines or corned meats sold in the supermarkets. One such company has a well-known Guyanese name!\\nConsumers should also be on the lookout for attractively packaged cosmetics, soaps, soft drinks, confections and potted foods with strange brand names, mostly smuggled from Suriname which are of low quality.',\n",

The goal of the campaign is to mobilise support and inspire people to act against drug use by raising global awareness which sparked the efforts of a group of John Gray High School students last year. A student elected committee along with the Life Skills department organised the 1st Anti-Drug March incorporating the Art, Music and Media departments which brought that unique feel to the day’s event. “The School Based Drug Education Programme is offered through the school’s Life Skills course and in 2016 a group of year 10 and 11 students were inspired to bring awareness to the campaign through a whole school march” stated Mr. Simon Miller, Prevention Specialist.\\nThe expansion of this year’s event meant that approximately 5 High Schools and 8 Primary Schools participated which allowed for a true community effort. “Last year’s march was extremely successful so naturally we extended the offer for all high schools to participate in the second annual drug march and mini conference, and would support any primary school who also wished to participate” stated Mrs. Brenda Watson, Programme Manager. Some of the positive outcomes of taking part in prevention programmes and campaigns include better school performance, less risky social behaviors, less substance abuse and less violent behaviors.\\nThe National Drug Council (NDC) along with the Ritz-Carlton and Marriott Community Footprints Organisation, other non-profit organisations, government, the private sector and volunteers, became involved in the 2nd annual drug march through:\\n\\uf034 School based drug prevention sessions and assemblies focusing on the theme\\n\\uf034 Involving students in varying activities that allowed for the students to create banners, flags, posters and crowns that depict meaningful and impactful messages\\n\\uf034 An island-wide student led anti-drug march\\n\\uf034 Mini-conference encompassing presentations on the impact of drugs\\nAccording to the 2016 Cayman Islands Student Drug Use Survey conducted among grades 7-12, about 75% of students indicated that their parents have talked to them about the importance of not using drugs and alcohol. The results also showed that of the students who choose not to use alcohol and drugs they identified their parents as having the most influence in their decision to remain drug free. “We have to acknowledge the significant and influential role that our parents have in helping their children grow happy and learn to cope well in difficult life situations” stated Dr. Susan Young , Prevention and Information Officer. Spending just a small amount of time each day by giving your child your undivided attention through talking about the importance of avoiding alcohol and drugs as well as asking questions and listening attentively are some first steps.\\nThe NDC run Parents as Preventers programme is designed and aimed at helping parents to recognize and understand the effectiveness of active listening, talking and setting clear rules and reasonable consequences. The free sessions are available to parents of children of varying ages and can be run through our offices or school PTA’s.

Investigators allege that Joseph Francis, 30, and his cohorts filmed the minors last week during spring break festivities in Panama City. According to cops, the \"Girls Gone Wild\" team brought two of the girls to a motel where they were each paid $100 for undressing, showering together, and masturbating as they sat on the side of the bathtub.

       " \"A photographer with a subject in the city of Reynosa, Tamaulipas, which has no regular police force. The Mexican army and federal police patrol the streets. Stefan Falke/Fronteras Desk/Flickr. Some rights reserved.Mexico decided over ten years ago to militarize their drug policies and rely on the armed forces to conduct counter-narcotic operations and other public safety tasks. The so-called “war on drugs” has taken since then a very real dimension in the country.\\nShortly after taking power in December 2006, President Felipe Calderon ordered a military offensive against the country’s drug cartels that eventually involved tens of thousands of troops undertaking tasks that should normally be performed by civilian forces. In only a matter of days, more than 30.000 soldiers were deployed in different cities around the country. This number has grown to over 96,000 soldiers carrying out public security tasks. Keeping drugs away from Mexico’s children has been a central justification.\\nKeeping drugs away from Mexico’s children has been a central justification.\\nIn addition, police corporations all across the country have adopted military techniques, training and equipment for the conduct of their daily activities, including counter-narcotic operations. Former or active military commanders are also in command of police corporations at different states or municipalities.\\nSince then, violence has spiralled and insecurity remains a source of intense concern. According to available information, more than 150.000 people have been killed since 2006, reaching an average of 51 people violently killed every day. However, it is not clear how many of these are directly related to organised crime and operations conducted by security forces. Moreover, since President Peña Nieto took office four years ago, the administration stopped informing how many of these deaths were committed by the armed forces, and it remains a classified information.\\nYet, despite a heavy reliance on the armed forces and criminal law to stop the use of drugs and drug trafficking, neither of these has decreased over the years. Actually, the age of first consumption keeps decreasing, reaching now children as young as 11 years old. In addition, the associated risks and harms of using drugs have risen with a corresponding increase in human rights violations.\\nAccording to the National Commission on Human Rights, complaints of human rights violations against the armed forces rose more than 900% during the first three years of the “war on drugs” alone. Arbitrary detentions, torture and other ill-treatment, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions are only part of the abuses that have been documented across the country.\\nThe age of first consumption keeps decreasing, reaching now children as young as 11 years old.\\nTorture and other ill-treatment have for decades played a central role in policing and public security operations by military and police forces across Mexico. Victims of torture and other ill-treatment are often forced to “confess” to being part of a drug cartel or involved in other crimes such as kidnapping or drug trafficking. At times, security forces torture detainees and plant evidence on them in order to obtain information about drug cartels or make them incriminate other detainees.\\nTorture and other ill-treatment are the second most commonly reported human rights violations before the National Human Rights Commission, only after arbitrary detentions. Reports of torture have shown a sustained increase since 2006. The Federal Attorney General’s office informed me that the number of complaints about torture filed at a federal level more than doubled between 2013 and 2014, from 1,165 to 2,403.\\nWomen in detention are at particular risk of torture and other ill-treatment. The vast majority of women detained in federal prisons are first time offenders, mostly imprisoned for drug-related crimes. Women are perceived as the weakest link in the trafficking chain by the authorities, seen as an easy target for arrest as drug cartels often recruit women from marginalised backgrounds to carry out the lowest and most dangerous tasks.\\nIn a survey conducted by Amnesty International with 100 women in detention, 72 were reported to have been subjected to some form of sexual violence during arrest, including, in many cases, the use of rape as torture. Out of all the women who reported the involvement of the army or the navy in their arrest, 80% reported being raped.\\nThis is the case of Claudia Medina, a young woman from the state of Veracruz who was arrested by marines in 2012. After breaking into her house, they took her to the local naval base with her hands tied and blindfolded. There, she was tortured using electric shocks and beatings, and was later raped and left tied to a chair in the scorching afternoon heat. The next day, she was blindfolded again and transferred to the office of the prosecutor, where she was interrogated and pressured into signing a statement without being allowed to read it. She was accused of being part of a dangerous criminal gang caught with arms and drugs. All the evidence against her was fabricated and the authorities ignored her claims that she was tortured. She was acquitted and released years later, but no one has been prosecuted for these acts.\\nOf all the women who reported the involvement of the army or the navy in their arrest, 80% reported being raped.\\nEnforced disappearances have also soared since 2006. Thousands of people have disappeared or gone missing since the “war on drugs” began, many believed to have been abducted by criminal gangs. However, many enforced disappearances have been committed by the police and the military, sometimes acting in collusion with criminal gangs.\\nThe initial wave of disappearances was much more marked in the northern states of Mexico, in the border with the US. But gradually, more and more cases have emerged in other states and it is now extended throughout the country. According to official figures, there are more than 30,000 people whose whereabouts remain unknown. Half of these disappearances have occurred during the last four years. While it is not clear how many of these were the victims of enforced disappearance in which the authorities have been involved, the response of the authorities has been completely flawed.\\nOne of the most recent and emblematic cases is the enforced disappearance of 43 students in Ayotzinapa, in September 2014. Rural school teaching trainees were travelling to Mexico City from the southern state of Guerrero on five buses when they were stopped and shot at by police and other unidentified individuals. The students got off the buses to try to escape, but the attack continued and three people were killed. A number of students were detained and subjected to enforced disappearances. The authorities' “official” version has claimed that local police handled the students to a local gang who then burnt the bodies of the students in a local rubbish dump and then threw their ashes into a nearby river.\\nHowever, an investigation conducted by independent experts appointed by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has proved that this theory is impossible, but we still don’t know the truth of what really happened, and the fate and whereabouts of the students remain unknown. Experts have suggested, as a line of inquiry, that one of the buses in which the students were travelling might have contained a large package of heroin to be trafficked to the US.\\nChildren and young people have been particularly impacted by the militarised response to drugs in Mexico. Adolescents and young people have been engaged at all stages of the drugs supply chain, exposed to organised crime, sexual exploitation, violence and drug enforcement.\\nThe fate and whereabouts of the Ayotzinapa students remain unknown.\\nDespite the authorities' justification (based on the welfare of children) the militarization of public security, combined with a zero-tolerance approach to drug use, have contributed to increased violations of the rights of children. Since the war on drugs began, there have been increased attacks on children and their parents, leaving thousands dead and tens of thousands orphaned. Even drug rehabilitation centres have been attacked, directly targeting young people who use drugs, and many schools have been caught in the crossfire, resulting in a significant drop in school attendance for fear of violence.\\nThe killings have included cases where children have died at military checkpoints, such as that of the Almanza boys, killed by army forces in 2010 while the family was on their way to the beach for a holiday in the state of Tamaulipas. As they passed through the military checkpoint, they reduced their speed and soldiers allowed them through to continue their journey. But a few meters down the road, soldiers opened indiscriminate fire against the car they were traveling in, killing Bryan and Martin Almanza, aged five and nine.\\nMost of these cases remain shrouded in impunity. It is estimated that over 98% of all crimes committed remain unresolved, and estimates also suggest that complaints are only presented in around 20% of all crimes. Impunity for human rights violations is even worse.\\nWhen a complaint is lodged with the authorities, cases are rarely investigated and those responsible are almost never prosecuted, let alone brought to justice. The almost absolute impunity enjoyed by perpetrators acts as a strong incentive to commit more crimes and sends a message that the authorities tolerate such acts. Some families have told Amnesty International that the main reason they did not report human rights violations to the authorities because of a prevailing sense of fear, resulting from the complete lack of trust in the authorities and the widespread influence and collusion with organised gangs.\\nIt is estimated that over 98% of all crimes committed remain unresolved.\\nPresident Peña Nieto has sought to draw a line with the previous administration and change course. During the campaign and first years in office, he promised to put an end to the “war on drugs”, reduce rates of violence and change the way in which drugs are regulated. But four years into his administration, little has changed. The army is still on the streets, violence has not decreased, and neither have human rights violations.\\nOf even greater concern is the fact that the administration has, for the past few months, been pushing a bill that would normalise the presence of the army in public security, particularly in the fight against drug cartels. If passed, the bill would allow the army to investigate crimes, collect evidence from crime scenes, conduct mass surveillance and even intervene in public demonstrations.\\nIn this general context of violence and militarization, human rights defenders exposing all of these violations and demanding truth and justice, including victims and their families, have found themselves at the forefront of the attacks, both from organised criminal groups and the authorities. They have faced increased threats, harassment and intimidation. In some cases, human rights defenders have even been killed because of their pursuit of justice.\\nHuman rights defenders have found themselves at the forefront of the attacks.\\nMexican authorities have done little to protect human rights defenders and to fully guarantee the rights of victims to truth, justice and reparations. Instead of recognising the crucial role played by them, the authorities have engaged in public defamation campaigns that delegitimize their work and put them at increased risk.\\nThis is why projects like “Anyone’s child” are so relevant in today’s Mexico. Wider support from the international community of human rights defenders and victims of the “war on drugs” is another tool to increase their visibility and ensure their protection. It is precisely these type of efforts to boost international solidarity that can contribute to putting an end to this context of violence and promote a change in policy that ensures human rights are fully respected and protected.\\nThis blog is adapted from a speech given by Daniel Joloy, Amnesty International, at the launch of the Anyone’s Child Mexico interactive documentary and has been republished from their website.

The article discusses these new dangerous drugs and how deadly these drugs can be. I have included her article below so parents can be aware of the dangers facing their teenagers. Hopefully, parents will also take this opportunity to discuss this issue with their teenagers.\\nSummer break is only two months so many teens want to get in as many parties as they can. During summer break for many teenagers this means partying with old and new friends. Drugs are often part of these parties. One major problem facing teens is the fact that many Emergency Room physicians cannot keep up with all the new drugs teenagers are using. Therefore, if a teenager ends up in the Emergency Room due to overdosing or having a bad reaction to one of these new drugs, a teenager may die before an Emergency Room physician determines what the teenager took and how to treat it. The show The Good Doctor had an episode which addressed this issue. The teen had used, Molly, not a new drug but because there were so many options, the teenager almost died before they could determine how to treat him.\\nAll had smoked an \"herbal incense\" product called AK-47 24 Karat Gold. Eighteen people were sent to the hospital by ambulance. The situation had all the signs of a drug overdose, and so doctors ordered the usual tests: blood count, urine analysis, heart rate monitoring.\\nOn a July day a little over a year ago, over 30 people collapsed on a street in Brooklyn. They lay on the ground, vomiting down their shirts, twitching and blank-faced. Some, half-naked, made jerking movements with their arms, eyes rolled back. Others groaned and clutched onto fire hydrants to try to stay upright. Witnesses said the scene was like The Walking Dead . Headlines claimed that people had turned into \"zombies,\" while police said that the 33 affected were lucky to be alive.\\nThe case went to the Department of Homeland Security and the Drug Enforcement Agency. They knew who to call to get a second opinion. They packed blood and urine samples on dry ice and shipped them to a small lab 3,000 miles away in San Francisco, run by toxicologist Roy Gerona . If anyone in the country could figure out what was in 24 Karat Gold, it would be him.\\nThe first patient tested was a 28-year-old man who was slow to respond, but otherwise showed few clear signs of trauma. Heart sounds: normal. Blood count: normal. His lungs were clear and there were no major neurological problems, no excessive sweating or skin lesions. He tested negative for opiates, cocaine, amphetamines. Nothing came up.\\nDesigner drugs are volatile. If you tweak just one molecule, you can get an entirely differently substance, one you hadn\\'t bargained for. They\\'re also easy to get. There\\'s no shortage of \"research chemicals\" vendors on the dark web are willing to sell. And they\\'re growing more popular. These so-called \"novel psychoactive substances\" entered the mainstream in 2009. That year, according to the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime , there were about 100 of these substances reported; six years later, there were nearly 500. Because designer drugs don\\'t show up on traditional drug tests, they\\'re hard to track and identify. It\\'s a public health problem that requires a special set of skills to handle.\\nForty years ago, drugs had easy names: cocaine, meth, heroin. Today, the names can read like an ingredients list for a chemistry class: 5F-AMB, PX-2, MDMB-CHMINACA. Today\\'s designer drugs are made by synthesizing chemicals and hoping they give you a high that\\'s strong enough to be worth it, but not strong enough to send you to the hospital.\\nOne of the most prominent categories of designer drugs are those intended to mimic marijuana, called synthetic cannabinoids. Marijuana, or cannabis, is widely considered one of the safest drugs, but synthetic cannabinoids are some of the most dangerous synthetic drugs. The Global Drug Survey (GDS) found that last year, for the fourth year running, the risk of seeking emergency medical treatment was higher after using synthetic weed than for any other drug.\\nWhen you smoke a regular joint, a chemical called tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) travels through your blood. It binds with receptors called CB1 and CB2. Because of the structure, there\\'s \"kind of a limit on how stoned you can get,\" says Adam Winstock, a London-based psychiatrist who administers the GDS. If you\\'re smoking a popular cannabinoid like K2 Spice, a chemical travels through your blood, but this time, it\\'s not THC. It\\'s something else that also binds with CB1 and CB2 — but unlike with regular weed, we don\\'t know exactly how these chemicals bind, especially when they\\'re illicit drugs from the black market. This mystery makes synthetic marijuana likely to lead to \"much more extreme responses,\" like seizures and psychosis, according to Winstock.\\nSynthetic cannabinoids originated in a quest to create a better pain medication. A Clemson University chemist named John W. Huffman synthesized hundreds of compounds in an attempt to find a better painkiller, but often created incredibly psychoactive substances with no medicinal properties at all. When he published the results of these compounds — called JWH compounds, after his initials — he made the information available to be copied.\\nThere are more than 300 JWH compounds alone, and around 2004, labs in China began studying old research papers, synthesizing the compounds and distributing them as \"herbal incense\" products. K2 Spice itself — often partly based off the JWH-018 compound — started in China, became popular in Germany around 2008, and entered the US around 2009.\\nLabs can also turn to the expired patents — patents that are rich fodder, even if (or perhaps because) there was a good reason said drugs never made it to market. It\\'s nearly impossible to figure out how to shut down the overseas labs producing these drugs. As soon as you ban one substance, the labs move on to another.\\nGerona, a toxicologist with gray hair styled in an undercut, was the one who received the biological samples from the DEA. From a small lab in the Medical Sciences Building at the University of California, San Francisco, Gerona says he and his team are playing a \"cat and mouse game\" with illicit international drug manufacturers. When an overdose happens, Gerona\\'s team tries to identify the drug in question — often synthetic substances no one has seen before. But the lab goes one further: Gerona\\'s lab attempts to identify and classify these substances before the mass overdoses even happen.\\nInside, the lab is meticulously neat: rows of spotless tables are covered in bottles with orange rubber caps, all labeled with orange duct tape, and small gray centrifuges. A window overlooking a courtyard has molecular structures scribbled over it in pink and green marker. Near the door sits an enormous freezer, filled with thousands of brightly colored, frost-covered boxes of drug samples kept at -112 degrees Fahrenheit.\\nGerona launched his toxicology lab in 2010, in partnership with the San Francisco Poison Control Center. The date wasn\\'t a coincidence; he says that 2010 was the year that a designer drug called \"bath salts\" began flooding the market. \"Bath salts\" is a blanket term for a group of designer drugs made from stimulants; they create a euphoric high like MDMA, sometimes with hallucinations thrown in. The drugs usually come in powdered and capsule form, and can cause freak-outs that were well-documented on YouTube at the time. The most famous of these was a viral story of a 31-year-old Miami resident attacking and then eating a homeless man. (Scientists dispute the drugs\\' role.)\\nFor users and the DEA, the spike in bath salts use was a nightmare. For Gerona, the increased interest in designer drugs led to more work and more samples from around the country. Eventually, the lab caught the notice of both Michael Schwartz, a toxicologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and DEA pharmacologist Jordan Trecki. A collaboration between Gerona\\'s lab and the DEA was formed. (Neither the DEA nor the CDC responded to repeated requests for comment.)\\nThe first step in doing an analysis at Gerona\\'s lab is getting the sample — urine, blood or, rarely, a tiny bit of drug itself — shipped over on dry ice. In traditional drug testing, you check to see if the sample matches any of the known substances: marijuana, heroin, cocaine, and so on. They match, or they don\\'t. Designer drugs, almost by definition, are made of chemical combinations we haven\\'t seen before. They almost never match traditional databases, and the chemists often don\\'t know what they\\'re looking for. So Gerona\\'s lab gathers as much information about the substance as possible.\\nA tiny vial of the biological sample — usually plasma, the colorless part of blood — goes into a bulky, printer-like machine. That machine is called a liquid chromatography mass spectrometer, and very crudely put, it separates out all the different parts of the plasma by mass. (Think of it like an extremely sensitive centrifuge.) That process makes it easier to identify chemicals, and the mass spectrometer then spits out the different measurements in a computer chart with peaks and valleys called a chromatogram.\\nThen, says Axel Adams, a graduate student in Gerona\\'s lab, you turn to the so-called \"prophetic library.\"\\n\" RESEARCHES LOOK FOR POSTS ABOUT DRUGS ON SUBREDDITS LIKE R/RESEARCHCHEMICALS\\n\"\\nGerona\\'s \"prophetic library,\" about three years in the making, is a detailed catalog of already synthesized variants that his team believes is going to be the next big street drug. The library was made possible with the help of Samuel Banister, a synthetic chemist at Stanford University. Banister synthesizes variants of popular street drugs and takes down their chemical information to create \"reference standards.\" Synthesizing can take anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks; the lab now has almost 150 variants on file. It\\'s a side job for Banister, but at one point, he says, \"I was pumping out five to 10 a week.\" The final products look like white crystalline solids and are kept in drawers in the lab, ready for when a case like AK-47 24 Karat Gold comes along.\\nIn addition, lab members spend hours each week on drug forums, researching trends. It\\'s more of an art than a science. Researches look for posts about drugs on subreddits like r/researchchemicals. They reference surveys like the Global Drug Survey and survey \"trip reports\" from experiential documentation sites like Erowid and PsychonautWiki.\\nThey look for terms like synthetic pot, K2, Spice, and sometimes, scientific terms like \"cannabinoids,\" or a specific popular class of cannabinoids, like \"FUBINACA\" or \"JWH compounds.\" Often, the posts themselves will include the name of the chemical. Gerona has ordered drugs off the dark web. In one case, the invoice billed him for \"cosmetics,\" and the package included lipstick, fake eyelashes, and tabs labeled \"powder.\" The \"powder,\" unsurprisingly, turned out to be drugs. But most of the time, the drugs in the powder were not the drug that was ordered.\\n\" THE INVOICE BILLED HIM FOR \"COSMETICS,\" AND THE PACKAGE INCLUDED LIPSTICK, FAKE EYELASHES, AND TABS LABELED \"POWDER\"\\n\"\\nIf there is a match because the compound is already in the library, finding the right variant is \"only going to take 15 minutes,\" says Gerona. \"Otherwise, it could take a week, or it could not be solved.\"\\nAdams checked the results of a blood sample tied to AK-47 24 Karat Gold against the prophetic library. The computer pulled up a chart that indicated a line — jagged, up and down — that shows the mass of the components of AK-47 24 Karat Gold, versus the same information for AMB-FUBINACA.\\nDrugs don\\'t pass through the body untouched. Once they\\'re ingested, the body processes the compounds. So by the time they\\'re in the blood or urine, it\\'s not exactly the same compound as the drug that was ingested. It\\'s hard enough to find a reference standard for the original compound; it\\'s even more difficult to find a reference standard for the possible variants. In the case of AMB-FUBINACA, the chemical in the biological sample from Brooklyn wasn\\'t the parent compound. It was a derivative. Luckily, Banister had already synthesized that variant, too.\\nThe peaks and valleys of the two lines of AK-47 24 Karat Gold and AMB-FUBINACA matched up precisely. It took the team only seven days to identify the substance in the Brooklyn case — and most of that time was spent waiting for the sample to get there.\\nGerona\\'s lab has worked on cases across the country, from New York City to Sacramento to Colorado. The number of cases varies. Sometimes, they\\'ll get 15 to 25 samples a month. One Mississippi case involving synthetic cannabinoids resulted in over 400 samples. The average turnaround on results is about six months, says Adams. That\\'s not good enough for Gerona.\\nAnd it\\'s not likely that the problem will go away. Marijuana legalization advocates claim that people will stop with the synthetic stuff once the real thing is okay. But that\\'s not true in the experience of Andrew Monte, a clinical toxicologist at the University of Colorado School of Medicine who collaborates with Gerona\\'s lab. Recreational marijuana is legal in Colorado, but he sees patients who are on these synthetic compounds anyway. Monte\\'s team has surveyed people who come into the ER and even set up at music festivals to ask attendees questions. Synthetic drug users are \"taking it for a different reason, to get a different high,\" Monte says. \"They\\'re really looking for something different than what pot gives, the same way you might choose cocaine over pot or meth over pot.\"\\n\" ONE MISSISSIPPI CASE INVOLVING SYNTHETIC CANNABINOIDS RESULTED IN OVER 400 SAMPLES\\n\"\\nTo help address this problem, in 2016 Gerona started a new research consortium called P SCAN, or the Psychoactive Surveillance Consortium and Analysis Network. (Yes, the double entendre is intended.) They\\'re working with about 10 poison control centers in places like Kansas and Colorado. They\\'ve had more than 100 cases referred to them and are writing up case reports and manuscripts. (The 24 Karat Gold case was published by the New England Journal of Medicine.)\\nP SCAN will continue to do the surveillance work Gerona has been doing for years, but also create a database of clinical data connected to the specific synthetic drugs they track and discover. Think of it like a medical version of Erowid. This way, the next time there\\'s an outbreak like the one in Brooklyn, investigators and researchers can look at specific physical indicators (heart rate, respiratory information, neurological information, and more) and say, \"Ah, this matches the symptoms of AMB-FUBINACA\" — all without shipping samples across the country.\\nBut even with P SCAN and the prophetic library, the task is huge. \"The identity of a lab needs to constantly expand and rework in order for it to stay relevant,\" says Gerona.\\nGerona is a biochemist by training. Before launching his lab, he didn\\'t know anything about Spice, or AK-47 Gold, or the dark net. But now, Gerona says, \"I have no other choice but to really learn about it, so that I am relevant and retain my relevance in the field.\" He\\'s hoping to work with people in technology to automate this \"market research\" to glean new insights and make the prediction process even faster. \"It would be so great if we could predict the drugs coming in with more accuracy, instead of after people are hurt,\" he says.\\nWeeding out designer drugs is a Sisyphean task, Gerona admits. It may be impossible to shut down the overseas labs, but he wants to have even better methods for predicting what\\'s going to get big and then, instantly identifying the substances. He compares the endless drug variations to nature: the cold virus is still around because it changes all the time. HIV has never been cured because it continues mutating. \"In a sense, they\\'re reinventing themselves all the time, so reinvention is key to persistence. As long as you\\'re reinventing yourself, you can persist.\\nDr. Michael Rubino is a psychotherapist with over 20 years experience treating teenagers. He treats teenagers with drug issues and has seen many end up in the Emergency Room because teenagers think they are the experts.

       " 'Research published in Cell Chemical Biology uses a new method to shed light on how drugs bind to a new cancer target. Share on Pinterest By using an innovative combination of chemical and computer analysis, researchers are one step closer to designing better cancer drugs. Killing cells is not difficult. Killing cancer cells while leaving healthy cells intact, however, is another matter. The hunt for anticancer drugs that specifically shut off enzymes that allow cancer cells to survive but do not cause havoc in healthy tissues is ongoing. Researchers from Uppsala University and the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, both in Sweden — along with colleagues at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom — may have done just that by developing a new technique that shows how drugs inhibit the new cancer target dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). Michael Landreh, Ph.D. — an assistant professor in the Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology at the Karolinska Institute — told Medical News Today about the team’s research. “The possibility to selectively kill cancer cells while leaving healthy tissue unaffected was recently discovered by the lab of Sonia Lain [… at the] Karolinksa Institute who identified DHODH inhibitors in an unbiased screen […] for broad anticancer activity,” he said. But studying which drugs effectively turn off membrane-bound proteins, such as DHODH, is technically very challenging. The team had to develop a new technique to overcome these difficulties.\\nChemistry and computer simulation DHODH is an enzyme located in the membranes of mitochondria, the cells’ powerhouses. Here, it is involved in the synthesis of new building blocks for DNA, the genetic code. This process is vital for cell division, and shutting it off has been shown to effectively kill breast cancer cells. Using a chemical technique called native mass spectrometry allowed the research team to determine which molecules bind to DHODH. Scientists often test new drug compounds on enzymes after they are isolated from cells. However, cell membranes contain a diverse array of lipids — or fat molecules — so Prof. Landreh and his colleagues studied DHODH in combination with lipids from mitochondria. The team’s findings show that the potential cancer drug brequinar inhibits DHODH much more strongly in the presence of lipids. “To our surprise, we saw that one drug seemed to bind better to the enzyme when lipid-like molecules were present,” says Prof. Landreh. Next, Erik Marklund, Ph.D. — from the Department of Chemistry at Uppsala University — and his team used molecular dynamics simulations to show how these interactions between DHODH, lipids, and brequinar take place.',\n",

According to a survey conducted in 2014 and 2016 to check the proportions of substandard drugs in India, 3.16% of the samples tested were substandard, while 0.02% were fake.In order to confront the problem, India's highest advisory body on drugs, Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (), will discuss a mechanism to stop the distribution of fake medicines in a meeting on 16th May.A proposal has been drafted according to which consumers will be able to check whether the medicine that they purchased is genuine by texting a unique code printed on the packaging of the medicine to a hotline number, said a report on Livemint Initially, the government plans to build a data bank of 300 medicine brands and customers’ consumption patterns in various parts of the country. Further, companies that manufacture drug will be asked to print a unique 14-digit alphanumeric code on the packaging of the drug. Consumers can then check their authenticity by sending the code to a predesignated number.Fake medicines lead to drug resistance and even cause a significant number of deaths according to public health reports. According to theorganisation, even samples from big drug makers were found to be of sub-standard quality during a survey that was carried out by the National Institute of Biologicals.The government expects to bring down the percentage of substandard andin the country to 2% in the next 3 years.

       " 'For the Anti-Narcotics Cell of the Mumbai Police, 2018 ended with the seizure of 100 kilogramme of Fentanyl, a potent synthetic and fatal opioid, worth Rs 1,000 crore. The drug was being transported to Mexico via air cargo from the city’s international airport. While on one hand, the police are investigating the money trail involved in this drug haul, the focus also remains on the use of darknet and its far-reaching effects in trading drugs across countries.\\nApart from the recent seizure of Fentanyl, the ANC sleuths said that the year witnessed other big and small drug seizures, mostly being traded within the city and involving less than the set commercial quantity.\\nWith technological advancements, suppliers use smarter ways to trade drugs within the city. Selling narcotics outside schools and colleges is now passe. Some of the recent arrests have brought startling facts to the surface. Law enforcement agencies are trying to understand the use of mobile phone applications and darknet in drug peddling. Orders for narcotics are often placed through WhatsApp calls as these internet calls cannot be intercepted, sources from the police said. According to the police, suppliers are aware of the profitability that darknet can provide them with.\\n“The calculation is pretty simple. If there is demand for a certain thing, there has to be supply for it too. Peddlers have smartly mended their ways for the sake of business after realising the changing trends; they have adjusted market setups accordingly. Previously, drugs used to be traded in open markets as there was no fear of law. But now, intensified police actions have reduced their trading boundaries to outside government schools and colleges. Young students and teenagers give drug peddlers a vantage point to trade their stuff as children are gullible and do not need much effort to be persuaded,” an ANC officer said on the condition of anonymity.\\nDrugs are supplied according to the demands of locals. The market for local drugs like ganja, charas, cocaine, heroine and mephedrone is wider. Other international drugs are only consumed by the upper middle class and can barely be tracked.\\nThe city police have also identified quite a few soft spots that witness nominal, marginal and significant activities by drug peddlers. “Parts of South Mumbai have more prominent places when it comes to drug peddling. Such areas are also inhabited by people from other nationalities, who work quite actively to set up their markets. A few soft spots in the western and northern parts of the city also witness active drug smuggling,” the ANC officer added. Speaking about party drugs, especially LSD and MDMA, another ANC officer said that they are traded through darknet.\\nBostik sniffing in Malwani\\nAnother trend that has emerged in the Malwani area is the smelling of Bostik. Bostik is an adhesive and a sealant that is used in industries. Bostik is accompanied by thinner which is used to dilute oil-based paints. These two things have a complex organic chemical composition that relaxes the mind when smelt. The liquids are easily available at hardware stores. They come in small bottles and teenagers constantly sniff the smell by applying them on a handkerchief or a long piece of rope.\\nThe locals of Malwani alleged that the police and the administration have not taken concrete steps to curb drug trading in the locality.\\n“Majority of the area has slums. Peddlers supply drugs near government schools. Also, illegal hookah parlours serve flavoured hookah that comes with other intoxicants. Children and youth are getting addicted to cough syrups and are stealing money to buy drugs. Mobile thefts and house breaking incidents are related to the menace of drugs,” founder of a Malwani based non-governmental organisation Janhit Vichar Foundation Abdul Chaudhary said.“Famous historsy-sheeters like Raju Plaster and Salim Tempo are trying to flood the area with drugs but, even the police are not taking measures to stop them,” Chaudhary said.\\nAlso Read: Water, land & rail : Drug trade on Punjab border uses all routes\\nFifty-three-year-old Iqbal Patel’s son Irfaan (23), is back home from a rehabilitation centre. “My son was down with all sorts of addiction at the age of 13. Every time he returned home from the rehab, he sniffed thinners and Bolstik. If we tried to stop him, he became violent. If I would not have been forceful with him, I would have lost him a long time back. I have spent my life to drag him out of that phase and even now, I urge the Malwani Police to wake up and save other children and teens who are into drug abuse.”\\nAn administrative staff of the Holy Angel High School in Malwani on the condition of anonymity said, “The world of drugs and crime has a one-way entry. If you get involved once, it is very hard to get out of it. We are seriously concerned about the situation in the area. We don’t know how drugs are circulated in Malwani but, we know that if appropriate steps are not taken at the earliest, we might be headed to a sad state of affairs.”\\nOn the other hand the Malwani Police have said that a total of 47 cases have been registered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. “In Malwani, the prominent drugs consumed are ecstasy, nitro 10 — a medicine used by cardiac patients, marijuana, charas and jaradh. Peddlers bring drugs concealed in the tyres of vehicles or inside an ambulance. Women too trade drugs in the area. We are seizing considerable amounts of drugs and are also apprehending the accused in such cases. Young children and teens fall prey to drugs because of curiosity, peer pressure, personal and family problems, anxiety and depression,” a police officer from the Malwani Police Station said.\\nThe ANC that operates in five units namely Azad Maidan, Worli, Bandra, Ghatkopar and Kandivali said that it had rescued close to 150 youth from the clutches of drugs in 2017.\\n“We focus on breaking the supply chain of the operational drugs syndicate across the city and once the chain breaks, there will neither be any demand nor any supply. We have seized drugs worth Rs 10.5 crore and have arrested a total 130 people for the same. The ANC registers cases under the NDPS and not the Indian Penal Code and therefore, all arrested have been booked under relevant sections and are facing legal trials. We expect to take more vigilant action in the future with regard to drugs,” Deputy Commissioner of Police, Anti-Narcotics, Shivdeep Lande said.\\nIN THE WEEDS\\nAfter the state government banned hookah parlours in the city, the youth have gotten more inclined to the consumption of weed. As per recent observations made by the police, peddlers are now adding different flavours to weed. They are also claiming that the drug is a herbal product without any side effects. In the last week of November 2018, a 27-year-old autorickshaw driver, Raj Bhagvansingh Thakur, was arrested by the ANC from Parel, for allegedly possessing 1.88 kg of mango weed worth Rs 2.50 lakh. His interrogation led to the arrest of a 39-year-old Tanaji Kate on December 19, for supplying mango weed, a hybrid variant of marijuana. The drugs were sourced from Andhra Pradesh, the police claimed. While taking cognizance of the same, the Anti-Narcotics Cell sleuths have seized about 1,060 kilogramme of weed and have arrested 168 people in 2018. The new flavours available in weed are orange, pineapple, mint, chocolate. They take after the widely available flavours of hookah. Weed being easily available and cheaper than other drugs is consumed at a wider and more significant scale in the city.\\nWILD WILD MANGO\\nMango weed or Mango Marijuana is an invention of bio-technology in which two seeds are mixed for flavours. It was already there in foreign countries. There are at least 18 operators in the city, who supply these flavoured variants of weed to college students. Arrest of a Dombivali-based supplier revealed that students use this drug for parties and it is being sold anywhere between Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 per gramme,” an ANC officer said. “An accused, who was instrumental in peddling Mango Weed, said that the peddlers now prefer mobile phone applications and darknet to reach consumers. He informed us about a mobile phone application which comes with an auto-delete option for photographs. This means that once the photograph is shared with a customer via this platform, it gets deleted automatically after a few minutes of having been posted. It is a trend which we are unable to penetrate,” DCP, ANC, Shivdeep Lande said.\\nCLASSIFICATION OF DRUGS\\nDepressants : Alcohol, Tranquilizers,Sedatives and Hypnotics\\n: Alcohol, Tranquilizers,Sedatives and Hypnotics Narcotic Analgesic : Opium, Heroin, Brown Sugar, Morphine, Codeine\\n: Opium, Heroin, Brown Sugar, Morphine, Codeine Cannabis : Weed, Hash, Charas and Bhang\\n: Weed, Hash, Charas and Bhang Stimulants : Cocaine\\n: Cocaine Inhalants : Thinner, Glue and Petrol\\n: Thinner, Glue and Petrol IV Usage : Phenergan and Fortwin\\n: Phenergan and Fortwin Not Classified: Cough Syrup\\nTYPES OF PARTY DRUGS\\nLSD, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Methaqualone, Altrazolam and MDMA',\n",
       " 'Not only has American society come a long way since the so-called war on drugs began during the Reagan administration, but our attitudes toward drugs have changed as well. When harsher enforcement and penalties began during the 1980s, “opioid epidemic” had not entered our lexicon and prescription drug abuse was nascent. Drug abuse was seen as a personal failing, not as a symptom of the illness of addiction. Now, with decades of battles in the form of criminal prosecution to look back on, we can see the financial and human casualties of our failed sentencing policies.\\nArizona has taken a particularly hostile stance on drug crimes. Charging decisions made at the prosecutorial level that make any drug crime a felony by default, and a sentencing structure that requires mandatory prison time, both contribute to the current state of affairs. This creates incredibly high stakes for any defendant, but also leads to plea offers with harsher punishments to avoid the even harsher mandatory minimum sentencing that would result from trial. Of the criminal charges filed in Maricopa County in 2015, eight of the 10 most charged offenses were either drug or alcohol-related — and NOT for sales or trafficking offenses.\\nAfter charging, drug offenses take a darker turn with Arizona’s classification of these crimes and the steep penalties they may carry. By default, possession of either marijuana or drug paraphernalia – without any minimum amount stated – is charged as a Class 6 felony. While some prosecutors choose to charge possession in small quantities as misdemeanor offenses, they must make the decision to charge down from what state law proscribes. In practice, many prosecutors charge even trace amounts of drugs as felonies and strategically charge the highest possible level of offense. This strategy enables a plea offer that looks compassionate by comparison to the maximum allowable sentence. It is not unusual to see a drug possession defendant with two prior felony convictions – even simple drug possession offenses – receive a plea offer of two and a half to four and a half years in prison.\\nA recent American Friends Service Committee study on drug sentencing confirms what many have said for years: Arizona’s prisons are filled with people whose only crime was to possess or ingest controlled substances. For some, this practice was simply a choice. For many more, it was borne of illness — mental, physical or both. So many people could be helped with treatment and services, and the committee study unveils that they are certainly not receiving either in prison.\\nInstead of getting these people into the treatment programs they need to overcome their addiction, Arizona taxpayers are paying for them to sit isolated in the world’s least effective “time out.”\\nThese people are our friends, family, and loved ones. They deserve compassion and care. As taxpayers, we deserve to not be paying the high cost of incarceration when recovery efforts would otherwise allow them to be productive, contributing members of society.\\n— Alex Benezra is a Phoenix-based criminal defense attorney and is the founding attorney of Alexander S.

The Tropical region accounts for half of the world’s land-based biodiversity and deforestation endangers two-thirds of animal species.\\nThough contested in the days since the news of the fires, 6 percent of the world’s oxygen comes from the forest’s trees, according to Jonathan Foley, former executive director of the California Academy of Sciences and founder of Project Drawdown, a research group focusing on climate change.\\nFUTURE OF THE FORESTS\\nExperts believe that as the rainforest disappears, the atmospheres in the region will dry increase in temperature, converting it to a dry savanna-like ecosystem.

       " 'From bugs to drugs. Credit: Shutterstock\\nA new study led by Prof Shoumo Bhattacharya has decoded the structure of unique proteins found in tick saliva and created new ones not found in nature, paving the way for a new generation of \"Swiss-army knife\\' anti-inflammatory drugs, with customized extensions to block different inflammatory pathways.\\nPrevious research by Prof Bhattacharya underlines that tick saliva can be a pharmacological gold mine, potentially yielding many new drugs which could treat disorders ranging from cardiovascular diseases and stroke to arthritis. This previous work identified a group of tick saliva proteins called evasins, which bind to and neutralize chemokines, a group of chemicals key to causing inflammation in the body.\\nNow the researchers have worked out the structural trick that enables tick evasins to block a complex pathway that has multiple routes to the same response. What\\'s more, they can now manipulate this structure to make new, custom-made proteins based on tick evasins.\\nBut why ticks?\\n\"Ticks have been around since before the time of dinosaurs, and they\\'ve have a few million years to evolve ways of biting and feeding off animals without triggering their inflammatory cascade,\" says Professor Bhattacharya. \"If you\\'re walking through a tick-infected field and get bitten by a tick, you\\'re unlikely to even notice.\"\\nOnce attached to an animal, ticks can feed for 8-10 days, successfully blocking pain, clotting and the body\\'s normal inflammatory response to injury.\\nThis inflammation is part of the body\\'s standard immune response: when tissues are damaged by for example, an infection, they send out distress signals, in the form of the chemokine proteins. White blood cells response to these signals and appear at the scene of infection or injury, to clear up damaged tissues and fight any infection.\\nGoing rogue\\n\"This process is usually helpful, but sometimes, the white blood cells basically lose the plot and cause further damage,\" says Professor Bhattacharya.\\nThis runaway, damage-causing inflammation is a key player in many diseases, including the aftermath of a heart attack, myocarditis (where the heart muscle becomes inflamed, resulting in sudden cardiac death in otherwise healthy young adults), strokes, arthritis, psoriasis, tumor inflammation, and inflammatory bowel disease.\\nSo researchers have been looking for ways to block inflammation, as a way to treat these diseases or at least reduce the severity of painful symptoms in patients.\\nThis turns out to be a more difficult problem than it seems, because the inflammatory pathway has multiple, redundant pathways, and blocking just one or even several receptors has little effect.\\nProfessor Bhattacharya says: \"The chemokine pathway evolved as a way to fight infections and foreign pathogens, so it\\'s evolved to be very hard to knock down.\\n\"The complexity of the network is hard to communicate: there are 47 different chemokines, which bind to 19 different receptions, and there are over 24 different white blood cell types. There is not a single available drug that blocks the chemokine network.\"\\nChanging research focus\\nProfessor Bhattacharya is the British Heart Foundation Professor of Cardiovascular Medication at the Radcliffe Department of Medicine—his main research interest lies in cardiovascular research, where rogue inflammation such as myocarditis was proving to be a vexing problem.\\n\"But there are no effective anti-chemokine drugs in the clinic.\" Says Professor Bhattacharya. \"What we did know is that blocking a single receptor or chemokine in the complex chemokine network has minimal effect.\"\\nThe idea of the studying ticks came from a Google search highlighting the tick\\'s abilities to evade the inflammatory response, something that the world\\'s leading researchers haven\\'t been able to recreate independently in the lab. Aided by the Radcliffe Department of Medicine pump priming awards, which aim to foster new ideas, Professor Bhattacharya repurposed his lab\\'s skills to identify some of the 1,500-3,000 proteins found in a tick\\'s saliva that would block chemokines.\\nThe result of this work was the discovery of 40 chemokine binding proteins that could do what no other anti-chemokine drug can do: take down the entire chemokine pro-inflammatory network.\\nStudying the pharmacological goldmine in tick saliva is now the main focus for Prof Bhattacharya\\'s lab, and his team have developed a new method for finding and isolating new tick proteins.\\nDr. Angela Lee, the first author on the group\\'s latest study, explains: \"We synthesize the tick genes chemically and insert them into yeast cells to make a tick protein \\'library\\' of sorts. The yeast cells now display tick peptides on their surface, and we then \\'bait\\' them: we mix the yeast with a fluorescent chemokine, and the yeast cells that take the chemokine bait now glow. We can then pull out the glowing yeast, find out the DNA sequence of the new evasins, and grow large amounts of these new evasins in kidney cells in a petri-dish.\"\\nUsing this method, the research team has cloned over 40 new tick evasin genes over the last two years, and found two distinct types of tick evasins that block the two major different groups of chemokines.\\nUnique structure\\nBut how does tick evasins bind so many different chemokines at once? This is the question that the group\\'s latest study tackled, as it decodes the structure of the new tick evasins that bind to the CXC group of chemokines. Dr. Angela Lee says: \"We found that the EVA3 evasin has a \\'knotted\\' structure, with each loop of the knot creating a surface that can bind a different chemokine. This is how tick evasins can bind to so many different chemokines.\"\\nThe team also went one step further, by transplanting the loops from one type of tick evasin into another type, to create a new hybrid protein with properties of both types. The hope is that these customized proteins could be used to treat a variety of inflammatory illness, from heart disease to arthritis to inflammatory bowel disease.\\n\"We\\'re still a very long way from getting drugs based on their tick proteins to patients,\" says Professor Bhattacharya, who is currently working with Oxford University Innovation to develop the research further, \"But tick evasins have been 300 million years in the making, and we do hope to get drugs based on evasins into clinics quicker than that!\"\\nExplore further From bug to drug—tick saliva could be key to treating heart disease\\nMore information: Angela W.

       " 'Emmanuel Kafe\\nFeatures Reporter\\nWHETHER it’s desperate times calling for desperate measures, or it is a question of ignorance on the part of consumers, dangerous developments are happening in the pharmaceutical industry.\\nMost medicines, whether prescriptions or over-the-counter, have expiry dates.\\nBefore this date, the manufacturer guarantees the user of full potency and effectiveness.\\nWhen the product expires, it means it has come to the end of its shelf life. It ceases to be effective.\\nBut for one reason or another, some pharmacies and members of the public are disregarding these expiry dates.\\nPharmacists who spoke on condition of anonymity to The Sunday Mail Society said some medicines currently on sale are long past their shelf life.\\nThey claim to have vast knowledge on the medicines, adding that their action is in the “best interests of consumers”.\\n“Yes, drugs have expiry dates but we use discretion. Some of the drugs do not lose potency two or three years after their expiration dates, hence we keep selling them,” revealed one pharmacist.\\n“It does not make business sense to dispose the expired drugs when they can still be used by our clients. Things are tough. It is now difficult to restock because of foreign currency shortages, hence the need to maximise on profits,” said another pharmacist.\\nDrugs are now priced beyond the reach of many, while other dealers are even demanding foreign currency, which is not readily available to most consumers.\\nWhile some people might have consumed expired drugs because of not applying due diligence — checking expiry dates — others are willing accomplices.\\nMildred Mapuranga, a Mabvuku resident said, “I suffer from arthritis and regularly need heavy painkillers. Sadly the drug prices have sky rocketed and I can hardly afford them. I was lucky to discover a pharmacy that is now selling me the painkillers at a much discounted price.\\n“I was told the drugs expired two or so months back but they are still efficient. I was sceptical at first but later realised that the medication is still providing the relief I need,” narrated Mapuranga.\\nThen there are those who end up consuming out of date drugs because of their hoarding tendencies.\\nDispensaries usually do not limit no-prescription drugs to clients.\\nDue to the prevailing economic squeeze, some people source drugs from different benefactors and end up with more than what they need. Therefore some of the drugs expire before they can be consumed.\\nThis is the predicament that Gogo Eunice Maramba finds herself in.\\nShe has a whole year’s stock of tablets for her medical condition.\\nSadly, some of the medication is now 10 or so months past expiration.\\nPermanent Secretary in the Ministry of Health and Child Care, Dr Agnes Mahomva said Government does not allow dispensing of expired drugs to patients.\\n“Those involved should stop giving out drugs that have outlived their shelf life because they are putting the lives of many people in danger.\\n“Drugs should first be analysed by the Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe (MCAZ) before they are given to patients. When any drug has passed the marked expiry date, it should be avoided,” said Dr Mahomva.\\nThe Government official further urged the public to report such practices to the police or relevant authorities.\\nMCAZ projects and public relations officer Mr Shingai Gwatidzo said their organisation conducts regular inspections in pharmacies to ensure adherence to regulations.\\n“Any extension of expiry must be approved by the authority after conducting due diligence on the quality and safety profile of the medicines. Without that approval, members of the public are advised that the safety and quality of such medicines is not guaranteed,” said Mr Gwatidzo.\\nSection 51 of the Medicines and Allied Substances Control General Regulations Statutory Instrument 150 of 1991 prohibits the sale of expired medicines.\\nIn trying to understand the effects of expired drugs, The Sunday Mail Society spoke to various health professionals.\\nProfessor Ishmail Muradzikwa, a part time clinical studies lecturer at a local university who is a pharmacist by profession, said not all drugs retain their potency after the expiry date.\\n“A lot of drugs are safe to use and are effective even 10 years after their expiry date. However, I would not advise people to consume them as some tend to become poisonous after passing their shelf life,” said Prof Muradzikwa.\\n“Expiry dates are there for a reason and should be respected. This is particularly important for vulnerable populations like children or the elderly, or those with chronic or serious conditions. If your medicine has expired, dispose of it and do so safely,” he said.\\nDr George Nyarangwa, a pharmacologist, is totally against the idea of consuming expired medicines.\\n“Medicines that have outlived their shelf life can be less effective or risky due to a change in chemical composition or a decrease in strength. Certain expired medications are at risk of bacterial growth. Sub-potent antibiotics can fail to treat infections, leading to more serious illnesses and antibiotic resistance,” explained Dr Nyarangwa. He said the new pharmacies mushrooming around town are usually behind such practices.\\n“These sprouting pharmacies are lining their pockets at the expense of consumers, putting their lives at risk,” he said.\\nOther health experts say a slight loss of potency in an antibiotic can negatively impact recovery as the drug may not reach the optimum healing levels required to eliminate bacterial infections.\\nThis in turn will lead to drug resistant diseases and health complications.\\nA report by Harvard Health Publications (2015), conducted by the US Food and Drug Administration found that almost 90 percent of more than 100 drugs are safe for use and effective even 15 years after the expiry date.\\nBut such researches create more questions than answers.\\nAre expiry dates a ploy by manufactures to stay in business by forcing consumers to periodically replenish their stocks?\\nShare your thoughts on [email protected]\\nLike this: Like Loading...',\n",
       " 'Pharmaceutical research does not move at the speed of light, there are checks and balances in place, processes to be followed. It takes, on average, 12 years for a major new drug to be developed. Just as the Royal Air Force could not fast-track jet fighters ahead of the Battle of Britain, the world cannot wait for a breakthrough new treatment to become available against a virus that has blitzed the world. In the war against Covid-19, medical science has no choice but to work with what it has.\\nThe term ‘repurposing’ is well known in industry, and in medicine, to a lesser extent, when it comes to tackling rare diseases that do not respond to treatment. The advantage of testing existing drugs on patients (whose safety has already been ascertained) is that this can be done quickly without the need to wait for FDA approval.\\nHaving analysed how Covid-19 attacks the body, scientists have been able to come up with a list of potentially effective medicines. Big data and AI have played their part too, analysing thousands of molecules must faster than naked eye. In France, Pharnext has already identified 97 drugs that could be repurposed as Covid-19 treatments, drugs that are traditionally used to treat everything from diabetes to hypertension. Their active properties are tested in vitro against the coronavirus, or in animals. Chinese labs have, unsurprisingly, been ahead of the curve when it comes identifying treatments, having already narrowed their research to a handful of promising molecules, including the now notorious hydroxychloroquine.\\nThe drugs don’t work\\nUnfortunately, as advanced as medical science is in 2020, human biology still contains many mysteries, and to date, scientists have not been able to replicate lab success in human tests, and even if they had been, there is no way of assuring that what works on one person will work on most. There needs to be a bigger data sample before a conclusion can be drawn on whether this or that drug is an effective Covid-19 treatment.\\nSeveral other medications have been tested on Covid-19. These include antiviral drugs, such as American company Gilead’s Remdesivir, a treatment initially envisaged to treat Ebola. With encouraging results in tests against the coronavirus, this is one of the most promising potential treatments, although for it to be effective, it needs to be administered at an early stage of infection, since it works by blocking the virus from replicating. Fujifilm’s Favipiravir has also been gaining favor, although its use to treat the virus has not been as widespread to date.\\nAntimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine has also been investigated at length, but initial results have been disappointing. Swedish doctors have given up treating Covid-19 with the drug, judging it to be of limited effectiveness and containing significant side-effects. Anti-HIV drugs such as Lopinavir or Ritonavir have not proved fruitful in treating Covid-19 either.\\nOther drugs are being tested to treat patients at a more advanced stage of infection. As with more severe forms of the flu, Covid-19 provokes extensive inflammation of lung tissue in some victims, and the extreme response of the human body is to massively secrete immune system mediators, which can become uncontrolled, causing lesions in the lungs resulting in severe shortness of breath. At this stage of infection anti-inflamatories could provide relief. In France, Actemra, an arthritis treatment by Roche, which has already been used as an anti-inflamatory in patients of certain cancers, has had positive results treating severe forms of the coronavirus. Sanofi’s Kevzara and Novartis’ Jakavi, are also promising.\\nThe immunotherapy initiative\\nOne of the most promising solutions is being developed by Japanese lab Takenda in partnerhip with plasma players LFB (France), Biotest (Germany), CSL Behring (Australia), Octapharma (Switzerland) and BPL (UK). This group is working on an immunoglobulin called TAK-888, extracted from the plasma of people who have recovered from the virus. The theory is that this ‘immunity’ can be transferred to patients.\\nThis is not a new approach: plasma transfer has long been used to treat aggressive diseases, such as tetanus. Several trials of this type have been launched, with varying degrees of success, but they remain complex and costly to develop, which is why, to date, they have only been used in a handful of cases.',\n",

Increases Drug Smuggling in Afghanistan To Fund Proxies All Over the World\\n1 Million Women and 100,000 Children Drug Addicts in Afghanistan. \"Thanks to the U.S. invasion, Afghanistan is a narco-state today,\" says the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan\\'s representative.\\nAt least one million women and 100,000 children are drug addicts in Afghanistan, said on Sunday (March 11) the head of the anti-drug department at the public health ministry of the Central Asian nation, Shahpor Yusuf, at an event at a drug rehabilitation center in Kabul to mark International Women\\'s Day.\\n\"There are between 900,000 and million women and around 100,000 children who have turned to drugs,\" said the Afghan official according to the Afghan agency TOLO News. Yusuf added that the children were all below the age of 10.\\nAccording to Kabul, the rehabilitation centers in Afghanistan have the capacity to help only a small percentage of addicts. But the problem seems to be far from the number of drug rehabilitation centers in the country, which provides 93% of the world\\'s opium.\\nMarwa Musavi, an Afghan woman for treatment at the center, said that it is useless being there. \"When we leave here, again we will turn to drug as long as there are smugglers [and dealers]. They should be stopped. It is the reality.\"\\nThese numbers much likely indicate that last year\\'s statistics released by the Afghan government is underestimated, which reported that the total of addicts in the country is over three million.\\nAt the same time, the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA) published a letter in Persian, denouncing that more than sixteen years after US-led invasion promising making the Afghan women free, they continue to be killed \"in a hell of Afghanistan, which is being set up by the United States and its Taliban, ISIL, Jihadists, and technocrats.\"\\nRAWA stated that the Taliban and ISIS are not the only groups in Afghanistan hurting women. \"US and NATO troops, and their armed forces in military operations, especially through air strikes in several provinces,\" destroy homes, hospitals, schools killing civilians, including children.\\nCivilian casualties are at record levels in Afghanistan: last year, 10,000 civilians were killed in the Central Asian nation, according to United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (Unama). The UN documented more than 16,290 security-related incidents in the first eight months of 2017, as the Trump regime is dramaticaly increasing air strikes since took power in January 2017, at record levels.\\nC.I.A.\\'s Drug Smuggling Big Business\\nFriba, RAWA\\'s representative who does not mention her real name as the revolutionary women of Afghanistan work underground, said in an interview with Pravda.Ru in 2016 that the C.I.A. continues trafficking drug from her country. \"Drugs were seen as the quickest and easiest way to earn money to fund C.I.A. proxies and paramilitary forces, in different countries.\" The Afghan activist adds this time: \"Thanks to the U.S. invasion, Afghanistan is a narco-state today.\"\\nThe C.I.A.\\'s direct involvement in drug smuggling goes back a long time, not only in Afghanistan but also all over the world as in the Iran-Contras scandal. The now dead governor of Kandahar province, Wali Karzai, one of Afghanistan\\'s biggest drug smugglers, had been for a long time on the C.I.A.\\'s payroll. Wali was Hamid Karzai\\'s brother, former president of Afghanistan picked by the U.S. shortly after the occupation, in 2001.\\nThis figure indicates the meteoric increasing of opium production in Afghanistan since the Washington regime invaded the Central Asian country:\\nSource: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime\\nAccording to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the total area under opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan was estimated at 328,000 hectares in 2017. it is worth remembering that United States\\' society remains the world\\'s largest consumer of drugs.\\n\"Thanks to its Goebbels-like lying machine of propaganda, the U.S. has been able to get away with much of its criminal activities, not just in the Afghan war, but in wars in Iraq, Libya and Syria, by lying to its people,\" Friba tells Pravda.Ru. \"Thanks to the U.S. invasion, Afghanistan is a narco-state today.\"\\nWhistleblower and former F.B.I. agent Sibel Edmonds wrote, in August 2017:\\n\"There were 189,000 heroin users in the US in 2001, before the US-NATO invasion of Afghanistan. By 2016 that number went up to 4,500,000 (2.5 million heroin addicts and 2 million casual users). Heroin deaths shot up from 1,779 in 2001 to 10,574 in 2014 (...). Ironically, the so-called US eradication operation in Afghanistan has cost an estimated $8.5 billion in American taxpayer funds since the US-NATO-Afghan war started in October 2001.\"\\nIn May 2009 Malalaï Joya, a human rights activist, writer and former Parliamentary expelled from office for denouncing face-to-face warlords in the Afghan Parliament, granted an interview to the Brazilian paper O Tempo (Minas Gerais state), in which she denounced that the C.I.A. sponsors drug trade and exert direct control over the routes of the annual global drug industry.\\nThe Brazilian reporter Renata Medeiros totally cut and modified her interview with the Afghan activist. The same day the piece was published, both in the paper and O Tempo\\'s website, I translated and sent it to Joya by email who, angrily surprised about the totally censored publication, immediately sent back the full interview to me.\\nBelow, a passage of Joya\\'s original interview with O Tempo in which the Afghan women\\'s leader quotes the opium matter in Afghanistan, reinforcing Friba\\'s denouncements also relating to the biased international media.\\n---- Forwarded message ----\\nFrom: Defense Committee for Malalai Joya mj(at)malalaijoya.com\\nDate: Fri, May 29, 2009 at 12:33 AM\\nSubject: Re: Interview (brazilian newspaper)\\nTo: Renata Medeiros (...) @ (e-mail)\\nDear Renata,\\nSorry that I took a long time to answer your questions and hope the answers are satisfactory and not too long.\\nAs I answered the questions in rush, so forgive me for any grammatical errors or any repetition of points in my answers.\\n(...)\\n[Renata Medeiros] What about the production of opium in Afghanistan? Is this another problem to the country?\\n[Malalaï Joya] The only sector in which Afghanistan has progressed beyond imagination in the recent years is drugs cultivation and trafficking, and now Afghanistan produces 93% of world opium which shows a 4,500% increase since 2001.\\nOne of the hidden objectives of the war in Afghanistan was specifically to restore the CIA sponsored drug trade and exert direct control over the routes of the U$ 600 billion annual global drug industry. The Afghan narcotics economy is a designed project of the CIA, supported by US foreign policy. So it is very understandable to see that since October 2001, opium poppy cultivation has skyrocketed and there are reports that even US army is engaged in the drugs trafficking.\\nDrug mafia is in the hold of power and supported by the West. Recently even Western media reported that Wali Karzai, brother of Hamid Karzai, runs the largest network of drugs in eastern Afghanistan and it is a fact that high ranking officials are engaged in the dirty business.\\nThe counter-narcotics efforts are also mere lies and dramas. A former warlord called Gen. Khodiedad is a minister of counter-narcotics and another former warlord and known drug trafficker called Gen. Daud is head of the anti-narcotics drive!!\\nThese days Afghanistan is not the only top producer of opium in the world but also the largest producer of cannabis, another illegal crop from which marijuana is derived.\\nOpium poses one of the biggest dangers for future of Afghanistan.\\n(...)\\nNo comma above has never been published by the Brazilian paper.\\nWhen the full interview was published in my book in 2012, O Tempo (Time) removed the \"fake\" interview from its website. So who does the mainstream media serve?

       " 'MANILA, Philippines – The Inter-Agency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs (ICAD) should be managed by the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB) and not the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA).\\nThis was the suggestion of Vice President Leni Robredo, who made public on Monday her findings on the Duterte administration’s drug war. Robredo’s report was based on her observations during her short stint as co-chairperson of ICAD.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nFor Robredo, DDB should take ICAD’s helm because it has the capacity to craft policies that would engage all member-agencies of the inter-agency committee – unlike PDEA.\\n“(N)irerekomenda ko na ilipat sa Dangerous Drugs Board ang chairmanship ng ICAD.

DDB is more capable of planning an overall program where each member of ICAD will help.)\\n“Kung sila ang pinuno ng ICAD, magiging mas balanse ang kampanya at lahat ng aspeto ay matutugunan,” she added.\\n(If DDB is leading ICAD, the campaign would be more balanced and all aspects will be addressed.)\\nAccording to Robredo, PDEA’s leadership of ICAD does not involve an across-the-board approach as it only focuses on law enforcement.\\n“‘Pag PDEA kasi law enforcement, ‘yon siguro ‘yong isang failure ng ICAD dahil ‘yong chairmanship niya binigay sa PDEA, talagang ‘yong pagka-lopsided in favor of enforcement napaka-laki. Sa DDB, ang tingin namin ang perspektibo mas malawak,”she added.\\n(PDEA was more on law enforcement, maybe that’s the failure of ICAD because the chairmanship was given to PDEA that the policy was more on enforcement. If it’s DDB, we think the perspective would be broader.)\\nRobredo’s report was an offshoot of her nearly 20 days as a co-chair of ICAD, during which she had the chance to talk with various officials and members involved in the operation of ICAD including PDEA Director General Aaron Aquino and DDB chair Catalino Cuy.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nShe said her suggestion to transfer ICAD’s chairmanship from PDEA to DDB was also borne out of her meetings with both agencies.\\n“Galing din sa karanasan ko sa pakikipag-ugnayan sa PDEA at sa DDB. ‘Yong DDB talaga ‘yong mas may capacity na mag-lead ng kampanya na sinisiguro na lahat ng aspeto nabibigyan ng atensyon,” she added.\\n(It was also sourced from my meetings and work with PDEA and DDB. The DDB is really the agency with the better capacity to lead the campaign while ensuring that other aspects would be given attention.)\\nTo recall, Robredo and Aquino had a rough start at ICAD and eventually clashed regarding Oplan Tokhang. Aquino had expressed doubt about Robredo’s capability to serve as an ICAD co-chair.\\nREAD: Robredo calls for scrapping of ‘Oplan Tokhang’\\nREAD: Robredo, PDEA chief Aquino disagree on scrapping ‘Tokhang’\\nIn the same public report, Robredo called Duterte’s drug war as a “massive failure” since it barely scratched the surface of the society’s drug problem despite all the money and resources given to it by the administration.\\nREAD: Duterte’s drug war barely nicked surface of society’s menace – Robredo\\nRobredo said that if it were an exam the Duterte administration would have scored poorly at 1/100 since it only managed to curtail a measly 1% of the total projected illegal drugs and drug money exchanged on the streets.

       " 'Mumbai: Although the government has intensified efforts to reduce the burden of tuberculosis in India, the rise in the incidence of drug-resistant TB and insufficient funding pose a major threat to achieving the target of eliminating TB by 2025.\\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO) 2016 TB report, there were an estimated 480,000 new cases of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) globally and India, China and the Russian Federation accounted for 45% of these cases.\\nThe overuse of antibiotics worldwide has caused many bacteria to become resistant to the drugs, including rifampicin and isoniazid drugs, which are used to treat TB.\\nIndia accounts for 24% of all TB cases in the world, and the spread of the disease in the country is larger than previously projected. While India has been engaged in TB control efforts for decades now, the disease continues to remain one of our greatest public health challenges. It is estimated to kill 480,000 Indians every year. Moreover, government data reveals a 35% rise in drug-resistant TB case notifications in 2016.\\nIn the recently released National Strategic Plan (NSP) for TB elimination 2017-2025, the health ministry said the key threats for TB eradication are amplification of drug resistance and insufficient budgetary outlay for health in the national budgets, which in turn compromises the allocation to TB.\\nUnder the draft NSP, the ministry seeks funds of Rs16,649 crore for 2017 to 2020. According to a report by IndiaSpend, this is five times what the TB programme received in the last three years put together—Rs3,323 crore.\\nWHO also recognizes that funding for TB research globally is much lower than what is required.\\n“Despite some progress in the pipeline for new diagnostics, drugs and regimens, and vaccines, TB research and development remains severely underfunded. At least $2 billion per year is needed for TB research and development. Funding during the decade 2005-2014 never exceeded $0.7 billion per year,\" according to the WHO report.\\nIn India, too, focus on TB research, especially drug-resistant TB, needs to be enhanced significantly.\\n“WHO reports that the last time a drug was introduced specifically for the treatment of TB was in the late 1960s. Resistance to antimicrobials is growing at a faster rate than discovery of newer, more potent drugs to overcome that resistance. Therefore, it is crucial that India focuses its research efforts on developing solutions for drug-resistant TB,\" Suneela Thatte, president of Indian Society for Clinical Research, said.\\nGlobally, there are nine drugs in advanced phases of clinical trials, including bedaquiline, delamanid and linezolid, for the treatment of drug-susceptible TB, and drug-resistant TB. Also, 13 vaccine candidates are in clinical trials, the WHO report said.\\nAccording to data from QuintilesIMS, a healthcare information and technology firm, around 24 molecules are available in India for the treatment of drug-resistant TB, which include fluoroquinolones and second-line injections as well as new drugs like bedaquiline. However, bedaquiline is currently provided only at six government TB centres and another new drug delamanid is yet to get approval from the drug regulator.\\nUnder the NSP, the government plans to introduce a shorter MDR-TB regimen and envisages country-wide scale-up of new drugs like bedaquiline and delamanid.\\n“We do have access to some potential new drugs and treatments, but we need to undertake research to study their effects. For instance, one of the clinical trials proposed by ICMR (Indian Council for Medical Research) includes assessing the safety and efficacy of using metformin, a diabetes medication, as an adjunct therapy for TB. Should the study show positive results, it would transform TB therapy for a long time,\" said Sundeep Salvi, director of the Chest Research Foundation.\\nLack of awareness about correct treatment among doctors, especially in the private sector, indiscipline among patients to complete treatment and limited diagnostic capabilities for drug-resistant TB are the other key challenges.\\nLokesh Sharma, head public health-Africa, Middle East, South Asia, QuintilesIMS, said about 50% of TB patients go to private doctors for treatment and the government has started engaging more with the private sector to educate them on the treatment options, which is a step in the right direction.\\nCurrently, standard treatment for TB lasts six months and treatment for drug-resistant TB extends up to 24 months.

       " \"Africa is expected to record a surge in illicit drug users between 2019 and 2050, a report has indicated. Currently, drug prevalence levels are higher in Sub-Saharan Africa than in Latin America and the Caribbean or South Asia, though not as high as in Europe and Central Asia. In the next 30 years, there will be an additional 14 million of such users in Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa will have about 23 million users.\\nSEE ALSO: Bill Gates calls for Covid-19 meds to go to people who need them, not 'highest bidder'\\nThe findings were made in a study by ENACT, a transnational organised-crime programme that analysed Africa’s drug trade, policy and future consumption trends. The drug scourge is blamed on weak regulation and organised crime across national borders. Of the five African regions, East Africa is projected to have the sharpest increase in proportion to its population that is abusing drugs. “In comparison, drug use is projected to increase by approximately one-fifth in Central and North Africa, while in southern Africa, it is expected to remain relatively stable, at approximately 1.3 per cent of the population,” reads the report. The study notes that East Africa’s increase of drug users will be due to its rapid urbanisation and bulging youth population who are the drivers of drug consumption and abuse.\\nSEE ALSO: Ask a doctor: Should I be worried that they sit too close to the TV?\\nThe report indicates that the youth, which is linked to a higher probability of social instability and violence, is having a growth in disposable income. “Economic forces are also likely to drive a more rapid increase in the prevalence rate in East Africa than in other regions,” the report states. “Household consumption, for instance, is projected to more than triple in Central and West Africa by 2050 but to increase more than five times in East Africa”. The consumption rate will become a public health emergency since the continent will not meet the demand for treatment. West Africa is set to remain the continent’s largest regional drug market. It will double from about 5.7 million users in 2018 to approximately 13 million in 2050. ENACT says West Africa’s role has also expanded as a global drug-trafficking hub, particularly for cocaine.\\nSEE ALSO: Helb not planning to suspend loans for engineering students\\nA growing heroin economy has emerged from the international drug smuggling route down the East Coast of Africa for shipment to international markets.\\nCovid 19 Time Series\\n“An underground economy has developed around the production and distribution of methamphetamines, particularly in Nigeria”.The markets are becoming more sophisticated as perpetrators take advantage of secure innovations such as blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies and trading platforms on the dark web. ENACT programme head Eric Pelser has implored the African Union and the regional economic communities to address the challenge. “Illegal drug use poses a formidable law enforcement and public health problem to governments in Africa,’ he said. ENACT is a European Union-funded partnership between the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), Interpol and the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime (GI). ENACT has called on governments to ensure effective systems that reduce production and trafficking of drugs even as they expand healthcare for treatment of drug users “Data collection and monitoring of drug use should be expanded and coordinated, and the stigma removed from drug use and the need for treatment. All regions of the continent should bolster their intelligence-led cross-border law enforcement to curb supply and production of illicit drugs, targeting traffickers rather than users,” it said.\",\n",

Repeat...after allegedly engaging in all sorts of shady behavior, from selling drugs themselves to lying under oath, falsifying records, falsely identifying drug suspects, accepting bribes, and stealing cash and other property from the people they arrested. In at least one instance, their behavior led to someone being wrongly imprisoned for more than two years.In an indictment unsealed this week, Scott, Newman, and Gemar--a Hammond Police Department officer since 2004 and DEA Task Force Officer since 2009--are accused of seizing money and other property from those they arrested and then keeping it for themselves. (Notably, the feds do not frame this as theft from the suspects but as embezzling funds from the DEA.) This went on for at least seven years.Scott is also accused of accepting $10,000 from a defendent in a federal criminal case in exchange for recommending that prosecutors seek a reduced sentence and, in another case, tampering with witness testimony.Scott allegedly coerced Frederick Brown (a defendent in his own drug case) \"to falsely testify that Jorge Perralta was present during drug transactions between Edwin Martinez and [Brown], when in fact Frederick Brown had never seen Jorge Perralta during his drug transactions with Edwin Martinez.\" Scott reportedly offered his own false testimony in the case as well.The DEA agent claimed that it was Brown who initially brought up Perralta when talking about people who were around during deals and might be Martinez\\'s supplier, referring to Perralta not by name but as \"the little Mexican guy.\" Scott said that he showed Brown a photograph of Perralta on his phone, and that Brown confirmed this was the dude he had seen during drug deals.An arrest warrant was issued, and Scott went to Houston to help police there arrest Perralta for conspiracy to distribute heroin and cocaine. Perralta\\'s phone was seized, he was taken into custody, and-without even being allowed to contact his parents or girlfriend, he was whisked away to Louisiana. That was in March 2015.After nearly two and a half years behnd bars, Perralta was released in August 2017 and all charges against him were dismissed.Brown had never brought up Perralta on his own, say prosecutors in their indictment against Scott. And when shown a picture of Perralta, Brown said that he had never seen him.Both Scott and Gemar were arrested on October 1 and released on bond the next day.Newman and Domingue were arrested in 2016. According to federal prosecutors, Newman seized and sold thousands of dollars worth of cocaine and oxycodone. Some of these drugs he seized from a woman identified as R.G. \"by means of actual and threatened force, violence, and fear of injury...to R.G.\\'s person and the persons of her family.\"Domingue is accused only of falsifying records related to this illegal drug seizure.

       " 'BEHIND THE FIGURES\\nBy IJEOMA NWOGWUGWU\\nWhat is it about Nigerian politicians that make them lose all sense of decorum in their public pronouncements and remonstrations? If it’s not Senator Bola Tinubu, the “Governor Emeritus” of Lagos State and a leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) boasting of his unexplained wealth exceeding that of his home state, Osun, it’s Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State threatening his colleagues in the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over their disenchantment with the choice of Port Harcourt for the presidential primary of the party slated for Friday this week. While Tinubu attempted to refute his own statement, despite video evidence to the contrary, Wike was purported to have apologised quietly to the PDP leadership after the public uproar over his crude remarks.\\nBut their attempts at swallowing back their own verbal diarrhea is beside the point. Like several politicians who have allowed the power of office and their ill-gotten wealth to overcome their sense of reasoning, they spew bile without a second thought for the implication of their vile statements. Indeed, the assault on our sensibilities by a lot of Nigerian politicians often brings to the fore the intoxicating effects of power and the perks of office. You see, power not only intoxicates, it can make one delusional and create an over bloated sense of self-worth. As my friends are often wont to say, “it’s like being on cheap drugs”.\\nWike, in particular, is one politician that never ceases to raise eyebrows. He is irredeemably aggressive, irascible, crude and gruff. According to him, his grouse with the PDP leadership over their lack of confidence in the choice of Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, for the party’s convention is that it would impact negatively on the state’s economy. He went on to warn that his government would not support what he termed “desperate” PDP presidential aspirants who are sabotaging the economy of the state by resisting the hosting of the presidential primary in Port Harcourt. He declared that there would be consequences if the party succumbs to pressure from “planted” presidential aspirants to move the party’s national convention away from Port Harcourt, promising that the Rivers people will teach the PDP a bitter lesson if it allows such persons to scuttle the hosting of the presidential primary in his state.\\nBut beneath Wike’s uncouth outburst was a grand design targeted at 2023 when he would have concluded his second term in office as the Rivers governor. His thinking was that if he could browbeat the large field of presidential aspirants in the PDP fold into holding the convention in Port Harcourt, he would effectively control the delegates that will handpick the Sokoto State governor, Aminu Tambuwal, his preferred candidate for the presidential ticket of the party, and Ekiti State governor, Ayodele Fayose, as the latter’s running mate. The purported plot is to impose a Tambuwal-Fayose ticket on the party in the hope that the pair would defeat President Muhammadu Buhari and his deputy, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, at the polls in 2019 while Wike waits in the wings to step in as Tambuwal’s new running mate in 2023.\\nFrom the foregoing, it is apparent that the Rivers governor has completely lost the plot. If he thinks that just because he allegedly diverted the funds of Rivers State to fund the party and foisted a visionless national chairman on the PDP in the person of Uche Secondus, the party owes him, then he must be extremely delusional. There was a PDP before Wike, and there will be a PDP after Wike! If its founders and leaders are unaware of the importance of a strong opposition that can keep the ruling APC in check and cut it in its track, then we have a serious problem on our hands.\\nUnder Wike and his minion Secondus, PDP has proven to be rudderless, weak and directionless. It stood by while Ekiti and Osun States were taken from its grasp by a marauding, all conquering APC, with the collusion of the security agencies and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Aside the Senate President Bukola Saraki, who moved mountains to assist Senator Ademola Adeleke, the PDP governorship candidate in the Osun governorship election, Wike, Secondus and other leaders of the party sat back and watched ineffectively as their candidate was gobbled up. As Rome was burning, Wike was fiddling away in Port Harcourt, griping about the convention venue, and jumping through hoops to shoo-in Tambuwal and Fayose as the presidential and vice-presidential candidates respectively of the PDP.\\nLeadership, if Wike must know, is not about issuing threats and bullying others into submission. Such tactics can only have limited results before a rebellion occurs. True leaders must get the buy-in of all members of the team, especially in a political party setting that is supposed to espouse democratic values. Wike’s remarks showed that he would not tolerate any dissenting opinion, even if they came from the party’s elders or leaders who started with the PDP from the outset.\\nAs it stands, PDP’s Wike has effectively disenfranchised the Southwest, a crucial swing geopolitical zone that can decide the outcome of the 2019 elections. Like a bull in a China shop, he first altered the zoning formula of the PDP by imposing his candidate as national chairman, much to the chagrin of stakeholders from the Southwest. He then went on to lose Ekiti, which was in the party’s grasp, and Osun by mismanaging critical past members such as Senator Iyiola Omisore who turned round to strike a deal with the APC long before the first ballot was cast in the governorship election in Osun State. And now, by attempting to foist a loud misfit such as Fayose, whose sphere of influence is limited to only Ekiti, Wike has further shown that he completely misreads the Southwest and its people. If it is his intention to handpick a running mate for Tambuwal from the Southwest, then he must spread his dragnet to throw up a running mate who will command the respect of the Yoruba people, not one that will be dismissed as joke.\\nEven if we were to buy Wike’s position that the economy of his state stands to benefit from hosting the convention of the PDP, one is tempted to ask what economy? In my estimation, the River State economy has continued to punch well below its weight under Wike. Like his predecessors in the Government House, Port Harcourt, Wike has thrived more on noise than on substance. Port Harcourt, the oil capital of Nigeria, remains underdeveloped and nothing more than a glorified township. Each time I visit the state, I leave with a deep sense of disappointment over the absence of infrastructure, the chaos on its roads, and the glaring poverty in the state.\\nWhat is worse is that Wike has convinced himself into thinking that he is outperforming his peers in the area of governance. Having built a few township roads and cottage hospitals, he goes around with the sobriquet “Mr. Projects” and styles himself as the best thing that has ever happened to Rivers State since sliced bread. In recent weeks, the Rivers governor even went ahead to hail his state’s emergence as Nigeria’s top investment destination in the first half of 2018, on the basis of a report churned out by the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC). The report showed that a total of $45.74 billion was invested in 42 projects in nine states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), of which Rivers received 35 per cent of the total amount while Bayelsa and Lagos States received 26 per cent each.\\nBut what he failed to note was that the report indicated that the mining and quarrying sector accounted for 61 per cent of the total amount invested during the period, an indication that capital inflow was into the insular oil and gas sector over which Wike and the state government have no control. Besides, the proceeds derivable from such investments in Rivers State would not accrue solely to state but to the three tiers of government. In contrast, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the definitive body responsible for providing monthly, quarterly and annual data on the Nigerian economy, showed that River State in the first half of 2018 attracted a measly $524,903.68 as capital importation, far lower than smaller states such as Abia which got $1.267 billion during the same period, and the behemoths, Abuja and Lagos, which were respective recipients of $6.1 billion and $4.325 billion as capital importation in the first half of this year.\\nI need not delve too deeply into Rivers State’s finances which at a glance show that it is over-reliant on allocations from the Federation Account for survival, its internally generated revenue has stagnated at an average of N85 billion over the last five years, while its debt service as a percentage of revenue continues to hamper with the ability of the state government to deliver the goods to its citizens.\\nIt is obvious that Wike needs to get his act together both as a leader of the PDP and governor of his state. He has spent an inordinate amount of time fighting the federal government at the centre, the APC in his state and his predecessor in office, Chibuike Amaechi who is no better that he is, while at the same time attempting to govern River State and retain a stranglehold over the PDP. In all departments, he has fallen short of expectations. As any juggler would attest, it is impossible to keep all the balls in the air for a prolonged period, as one or two of them will eventually come crashing down.\\nIf Wike must provide leadership to the PDP so that the party can provide a credible and effective challenge to the APC come 2019, he must be strategic, inclusive and unselfish. It is irrelevant that he is providing the funds that are keeping PDP afloat and therefore can keep dictating the tune. As pointed out earlier, a rebellion within the ranks of the PDP would blow up in his face, if care is not taken. Wike could also learn a thing or two from Tinubu whose so-called control over the Southwest continues to wane by the day.\\nCalling Tinubu’s Bluff\\nNot that I think much of him, but Governor Akinwunmi Ambode of Lagos State made my day yesterday. He stopped begging Bola Ahmed Tinubu, a former governor of the state, who thinks he owns Lagos, by calling the latter’s bluff. Ambode made it known at a press conference yesterday that he intends to contest the governorship primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) slated to take place in the state today.\\nIn so doing, he told Tinubu to bring it on. With a bit of providence and political guile, Ambode’s gamble may just pay off. If the so-called national leader of the APC was so certain that he could impose his new boy Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Nigeria’s commercial capital, there would have been no need to threaten to impeach Ambode should the governor refuse to drop his quest for a second term in office.\\nThe APC led by Tinubu in Lagos had initially insisted on conducting direct primaries to select its governorship candidate for the 2019 elections. Then the former governor suddenly reversed himself at the weekend by ordering Ambode to withdraw from the contest to allow the APC to present Sanwo-Olu as the consensus candidate of the party in the state. Using his influence also, Tinubu got the party’s leadership at the centre to postpone the APC governorship primary by two days. If the entrenchment of democracy was at the heart of the choice for the direct primary, why the sudden need for a consensus candidate to contest the governorship election in Lagos next year? All these actions point to the uncertainty in Tinubu’s camp to supplant Ambode with Sanwo-Olu.\\nThe handwriting is very clear on the wall that Tinubu is no longer as invincible as he once was. The Lion of Bourdillon is aging and is losing his grip in a state over which he has held sway for almost two decades. Otherwise, there will be no need for the impeachment threat. Tinubu through Sanwo-Olu should go and test his popularity at the primary today. May the most popular man win.',\n",

       " 'Presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey said last Wednesday night that he was ‘disappointed’ that the subject of marijuana legalization did not come up during the Democratic Party debates held this week. The party conducted two separate rounds of debates on Wednesday and Thursday to accommodate the broad field of Democratic candidates. Twenty candidates sparred over the two evenings, 10 each night, while several other Democratic hopefuls failed to qualify to participate in the contests under party rules.\\n“I am absolutely disappointed that wasn’t an issue when you see voters turning out this issue all over the country,” Booker said after the first round of the debates on Wednesday.\\nBooker has been an outspoken advocate for reform of the nation’s marijuana laws, believing that cannabis legalization is an essential part of broader criminal justice reform he is seeking. The junior senator from New Jersey is also calling for the reversal of past convictions for marijuana offenses.\\n“I would like to see the federal government end it’s making marijuana illegal and pull back and let the states do what they want,” said Booker. “But I am also one of those people that thinks you cannot talk about marijuana legalization if in the same sentence you’re not talking about expunging the records of those Americans who have criminal convictions for doing things that two of the last three presidents admitted to doing.”\\nBooker Touts His ‘Marijuana Justice Act’\\nBooker said he was frustrated that the subject of cannabis legalization was not discussed at the debates, characterizing himself “as a guy who has one of the boldest bills” on the issue.\\nIn February, Booker reintroduced the Marijuana Justice Act in the U.S. Senate, a bill that would legalize cannabis at the federal level. He originally introduced the bill in the Senate in 2017, but the measure was never taken up for a vote. Booker said in a statement announcing the re-introduction of the bill that cannabis prohibition has had a devastating effect on minority communities.\\n“The War on Drugs has not been a war on drugs, it’s been a war on people, and disproportionately people of color and low-income individuals,” Booker said. “The Marijuana Justice Act seeks to reverse decades of this unfair, unjust, and failed policy by removing marijuana from the list of controlled substances and making it legal at the federal level.”\\nThe Marijuana Justice Act has received strong support in the Senate, including from his colleagues and fellow Democratic Party presidential candidates Sens. Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Michael Bennet, and Bernie Sanders, all of whom also participated in this week’s debates.',\n",

       " '* Government says offer genuine, not cynical\\n* Unclear if Robredo will take post\\n* United Nations to conduct report into killings\\n* Critics say Duterte\\'s approach ineffective (Adds detail, context, comment throughout)\\nBy Martin Petty and Neil Jerome Morales\\nMANILA, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has appointed his main political rival, Leni Robredo, his \"drugs tsar\", after the opposition leader expressed alarm about the high death toll in his anti-narcotics campaign and said it needed a fresh approach.\\nThe appointment follows critical remarks by Robredo during an interview with Reuters, and in subsequent media appearances, which angered the volatile Duterte and led to a torrent of social media fury at Robredo, who is his vice president but has no role in his administration.\\nDuterte\\'s spokesman announced Robredo\\'s appointment on Tuesday as co-chair of an inter-agency panel on drugs, which he said was genuine and not a cynical political play to discredit her, as her camp believed. The president has ordered all agencies to give her their full support.\\n\"If she has been criticising the drug war as ineffective, then there must be ideas on her mind to make it effective,\" Panelo said on television.\\nRobredo, 54, was elected separately to Duterte and is among a growing number of critics who say his approach has boosted his tough image but had little impact on the drugs trade or addiction rates.\\nShe did not immediately confirm if she would take the job. Her spokesman has said she would not be a scapegoat for the shortcomings of Duterte\\'s war on drugs.\\nHe remains hugely popular because of his defiance of the international outcry caused by his signature crackdown, which human rights groups say involves systematic executions and police cover-ups. Police reject that and say the nearly 7,000 people they killed were armed drug suspects who resisted arrest.\\nDuterte is furious that the U.N. Human Rights Council wants to investigate the killings, adding to an ongoing preliminary examination by the International Criminal Court (ICC), of which Duterte has cancelled the Philippines\\' membership.\\nOBLIGED TO ACCEPT\\nAllies of the president urged Robredo to take the post while the Dangerous Drugs Board and police said they welcomed her experience, ideas and new perspective.\\nPolitical analyst Ramon Casiple said that politics aside, Robredo was not in a position to decline.\\n\"There\\'s the obligation, not just a personal decision. If you were elected and the president sought for help, you will,\" he said.\\nDuterte has openly insulted Robredo, who leads a party with diminished power and influence.\\nShe advocates tackling drugs from a health, social and community perspective, including prevention and treatment rather than a largely police-centred approach.\\nActivists say police are operating with impunity, with the implied support of a president who once vowed to kill 100,000 dealers, and he would be happy to slaughter millions of addicts. He has since said he uses hyperbole to stress a point and denies inciting murder.\\nEstimates of the number killed during the drugs war vary significantly, but thousands of users and alleged dealers have wound up dead outside of official police operations, many in mysterious circumstances.\\nRobredo on Oct. 23 told Reuters that international help, including from the United Nations and ICC, should be sought if the government refused to change tack and stop abusive police. On Duterte\\'s approach, she said: \"Obviously, it\\'s not working.\"\\nGwendolyn Pimentel-Gana of the Commission on Human Rights was hopeful Robredo could stop the killings.\\n\"Are we going to look at addicts as victims?\" she said. \"The approach would not be to kill them but to rehabilitate them.\" (Additional reporting by Karen Lema Editing by Robert Birsel)\\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.',\n",

       " 'Most new drugs entering the market, particularly medications for neurologic and psychiatric disorders, provide no additional benefit over and above the existing standard of care, new research suggests.\\nIn a large study, investigators found that only 54 (25%) of the 216 new drugs entering the German market between 2011 and 2017 were judged to have a considerable, or major, added benefit.\\nFor 16% of these new agents, this additional benefit was either minor or could not be quantified. In addition, for 58% of these medications there was no proof of added benefit vs standard of care in the approved patient population.\\nThe field of psychiatry/neurology fared the worst with just one of 18 new drugs (6%) showing added benefit. New drugs for diabetes also performed badly with only four out of 24 (17%) showing extra value.\\n\"It is not acceptable that physicians and patients don\\'t understand if these new drugs have extra value or not,\" lead author Beate Wieseler, PhD, German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care in Cologne, told Medscape Medical News.\\n\"We are suggesting that there should be a requirement at the point of approval to show an added benefit over standard of care. Approval should be dependent on this,\" she added.\\nThe findings were published online July 10 in the British Medical Journal.\\nNeed for Active Comparator Trials\\nThe investigators note that almost all of these medications were approved by the European Medicines Agency for use throughout Europe.\\n\"Thus our results also reflect the outcome of European drug development processes and policies,\" they write.\\nThey suggest that the situation has come about because regulators still allow placebo-controlled studies even though health technology assessment bodies have long recommended active controlled trials, which provide more useful information.\\nOf the 125 drugs lacking data on added benefit in the analysis, 64 had no studies vs an active comparator.\\nFor another 42 drugs, studies compared the drug with an active comparator — but the comparator was inappropriate for such reasons as off-label drug use or inappropriate dosing regimens. The remaining 19 new drugs were tested against an appropriate comparator (standard care) but did not show an advantage.\\nThe investigators acknowledge the argument that drugs can be approved without showing \"added benefit\" data to allow speedy access to new products, with the promise of future comparative studies. However, they note, such promises are often never fulfilled.\\n\"A critical and well known problem with post-marketing studies is they often do not happen.... Globally, regulators do little to sanction non-compliant companies,\" the researchers write.\\n\"High levels of uncertainty about treatment benefit jeopardize quality care and impede decision making, particularly on highly priced drugs in economically strained situations,\" they add.\\nDemand for Robust Evidence\\nRegulators should demand \"robust evidence from longer term and sufficiently large phase III randomised controlled trials to prove efficacy and safety, which in parallel could be used to collect data for health technology assessment,\" the researchers write.\\nThey also call for a mandatory requirement to conduct active controlled trials.\\nThe current initiative on legislation for health technology assessment in Europe is an opportunity to implement such requirements, they write.\\nThe investigators also suggest that health policy makers need to take a more proactive approach in the drug development process.\\n\"Rather than waiting for drug companies to decide what to develop, they could define the health system\\'s needs and implement measures to ensure the development of the treatments required,\" they write, adding that this could include needs-oriented public-private partnerships and not-for-profit drug development.\\nThe researcher add that the drug development process and policies in Europe are not sufficient.\\n\"Combined action at EU and national levels is required to define public health goals and to revise the legal and regulatory framework, including introducing new drug development models, to meet these goals and focus on what should be the main priority in healthcare: the needs of patients,\" they conclude.\\nIndustry Responds\\nIn response to the article, the Association of Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies in Germany issued a statement pointing out that the assessment of additional benefit \"is not an easy matter — there is not always a \\'right\\' or \\'wrong.\\'\"\\n\"Without additional benefit, in the language of the methodologists, usually means \\'just as good as the comparative therapy.\\' And precisely these drugs play an important role in medicine as treatment alternatives,\" they write.\\nFor example, if a drug is not tolerated, \"it is important that another, equivalent drug can be prescribed. For indications such as epilepsy, every alternative therapy is needed,\" they add.\\nThe Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) also issued a statement in response to the article.\\n\"The UK has robust measures in place to ensure that medicines and vaccines are both clinically and cost effective before they can be used in the NHS. A medicine that can\\'t demonstrate value is unlikely to be recommended for use,\" Richard Torbett, the ABPI\\'s executive director of Commercial Policy: UK & International, said in the statement.\\n\"Often we find that studies making similar claims invariably take a very narrow view of what constitutes \\'value\\' that ignores issues that are important to patients,\" he added.\\nFor context, the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence in England \"takes a rigorous look at evidence on both clinical and cost effectiveness in making recommendations to the NHS and it recommends over 80% as being value for money,\" Torbett said.\\nThe study authors have disclosed no relevant financial relationships.\\nBMJ. 2019;366:l4340.

       " 'Vietnamese investigation police have identified the lax management of the Drug Administration of Vietnam (DAV), which operates under the Ministry of Health, in the case of sale of fake cancer medicine by VN Pharma. The police on September 18 decided to prosecute the criminal case of lacking responsibility causing serious consequences at the DAV and related agencies. The police stepped in two days after the Government Inspectorate (GI) asked for them to consider the case for possible crimes. The scandal broke in 2014 when suspicions were raised over the origin of the H-Capita 500mg medicine and authorities launched an investigation. Nguyen Manh Hung, VN Pharma’s former general director, ordered underlings to forge papers for the Helix company in order to get licenses to bring the medicine into Vietnam. Tests by the health ministry concluded that 97% of the H-Capita drug consisted of capecitabine – a chemotherapy medication used to treat breast, gastric and colorectal cancer. However, the medicine was of unknown origin, subpar quality and its packaging failed to prove the drugs were safe to treat human diseases. Up to 12 people have been prosecuted in the case so far while the authorities started looking into the responsibilities of the health ministry. (Thanh Nien, bbc, Thanh Nien, Tin Tuc, VietStock)',\n",

Earlier this month, the Scottish Government announced it was stepping in to secure lumacaftor-ivacaftor for patients on the NHS in Scotland.\\nThe Labour leader accused pharmaceutical companies of putting \"profits for shareholders before people\\'s lives\" in the case of Luis and thousands of others living with conditions such as cystic fibrosis, hepatitis C, and breast cancer.\\nPlans for a publically-owned generic drugs manufacturer were a longer-term ambition, Labour made clear. It also planned to replace the current system where research and development funding was channelled into the most lucrative and profitable medicines to one where upfront grants and funding awards were tied to public health priorities, such as antimicrobial resistance.\\nAlso, in cases where taxpayers\\' money was spent on funding for research and development, manufacturers would be bound to ensure patient access and affordability.\\n\"We’ll tell the drugs companies that if they want public research funding, then they’ll have to make their drugs affordable for all,\" Mr Corbyn told delegates in Brighton on Tuesday.\\nIn the intermediate future, Labour planned to:\\nActively use voluntary and compulsory licenses to secure affordable generic versions of patented medicines where the patented product could not be accessed\\nIncrease the transparency of medicine prices, the true cost of research and development, and pharmaceutical company finances so that the NHS could have informed discussions on drug pricing\\nResist efforts to increase corporate control over medicine and drug intellectual property rights in future trade deals\\nThe End of Big Pharma\\'s \\'Stranglehold\\' Over Medicines?\\nSome health campaigners welcomed Labour\\'s announcement.\\nProf Mariana Mazzucato, director of the University College London Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose said: \"When the Government funds the development of new medicines it must do so in a systematic way to make sure that the benefits reach the patients that need them.\\n\"Instead, we currently have a system where the risks of innovation are socialised, while the benefits are privatised through dysfunctional uses of intellectual property rights, a financialised business model, and a pricing system that does not recognise taxpayer investment.\"\\nHeidi Chow, campaigns manager at Global Justice Now commented: \"This could be the beginning of the end of Big Pharma\\'s stranglehold over our medicines.\\n\"We cannot go on with patients suffering needlessly without vital drugs, as medicine prices skyrocket and the pharmaceutical industry makes billions.

       " 'The growing recognition of teenagers’ vulnerability to criminal exploitation requires new approaches from children’s services departments\\nThe growing recognition of teenagers’ vulnerability to criminal exploitation requires new approaches from children’s services departments\\ndrugs Drugs are flowing out from urban areas via vulnerable youngsters\\nChildren’s social care services are changing the way they work to tackle the growing problem of ‘county lines’ drug operations, which involve the criminal exploitation of young people to supply and sell illicit substances in smaller towns and rural areas. However, uncertainty over funding has raised fears that efforts to protect those at risk could be hampered.\\nThe National Crime Agency’s intelligence assessment of county lines drug supply published in January provided the clearest picture yet of how sophisticated and adaptable criminal networks prey on the young and vulnerable.\\nNCA analysis suggests there are 2,000 individual phone lines selling drugs, linked to approximately 1,000 ‘branded’ county lines operations controlled by criminal networks based in urban areas.\\nThe exploitation of vulnerable people to deal and move drugs is described as a “key element” of the offending model. The Home Office National Referral Mechanism (NRM), which identifies victims of trafficking and exploitation, shows 24% of recorded county lines cases involved children, with a further 2% of cases linked to child sexual abuse. While these child victims were as young as 11, a “large” but unspecified majority were boys aged 15 to 17. Ten per cent of all cases involved serious physical violence.\\nHowever, the scale of criminal activity and the number of victims is likely to be under-represented as the NRM presents data only according to the primary exploitation type recorded.\\nChildren with a broad range of vulnerabilities are regularly targeted, with poverty, family breakdown, involvement with social services, behavioural and developmental disorders and exclusion from mainstream schools identified as characteristics criminals look for when identifying victims.\\nThis places children’s social care services at the centre of eff orts to identify and support victims, with a key role in prevention, rehabilitation and family support.\\nIf we don’t start to be honest about what is making a difference and what is not, the public sector is going to be in a difficult place Heather Sandy, Lincolnshire CC\\nHowever, senior officers at the forefront of adapting their councils’ approaches to meet new complex challenges have highlighted existing ﬁnancial pressures in key parts of the system and expressed concern at uncertainty over future funding for vital interventions.\\nThe NCA has identified London as the origin of the largest number of county lines operations, with 15% of all dealing lines stemming from the Metropolitan Police area.\\nAt Wandsworth LBC, assistant director for early help Rachel Egan told LGC there is a range of work under way in response to the threat. This combines a focus on establishing risk and upscaling prevention efforts with a “trauma-based approach” recognising the past distress many child offenders who have been exploited are likely to have suffered.\\nBut Ms Egan admitted a lot of the current approach to children’s social care was geared towards protecting children from “familial factors” when “a real contextual and holistic approach” is needed to address broader, emerging risks.\\nShe said: “We have got work to do to deal with immediate problems. We have got to get investment in early intervention and understand what the evidence is and translate that into practice. Until we do that we are always fighting fires.” Ms Egan added uncertainty over the future of the government’s Troubled Families programme, which during its second phase will see £920m allocated to councils up to 2020, is “one of the big questions” as it supports work in Wandsworth to keep children at home, where they are considered less vulnerable to exploitation.\\n“With that whole family approach, we have a lot of services supported through [Troubled Families] in early intervention, she said. “If that ends and there is nothing to replace it we will have fewer people to work with families.”\\nLast month it was announced the government had made £9.8m of Troubled Families funding available specifically to tackle youth crime. However, when asked by LGC the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government could not commit to the funding continuing beyond 2020, saying it would be considered as part of the spending review.\\nCouncil spending on youth justice, which includes youth offending teams and the costs of young offenders on remand, fell by £156.6m (51%) nationally between 2010-11 and 2017-18, according to the National Audit Office. Central government funding for youth offending teams, a key component in the fight against exploitation, halved between 2010-11 and 2017-18, from £145m to £72m. Councils have had to top up funding for important prevention work.\\nThe number of children held in youth custody on remand increased in 2017-18 by 19% on the previous year and made up nearly a quarter (24%) of all children in youth custody. A report earlier this year by charity Transform Justice found evidence that remand is particularly likely if the child is said to be involved in a gang activity by the prosecution.\\nLGC analysis of council outturn ﬁgures for youth justice spending between 2015-16 and 2017-18 shows a 4.5% fall nationally. However, there was a 5% increase in 2017-18 on the previous year. This rise coincided with an announcement by the Youth Justice Board, which provides funding to councils for remand costs, that nightly rates for keeping children in custody would increase by up to 13.6%.\\nHowever, there is signiﬁcant variation in youth justice spending across the country, with 59 of 150 councils experiencing a reduction in spending of 20% or more over the period. A spokesman for Cornwall Council, which had one of the largest falls at 76%, said the area is the second most deprived region in northern Europe according to Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Commission, with some of the lowest levels of funding for education and social care in the country.\\nThey added the council is facing signiﬁcant budget pressures due to continued cuts in funding from central government and rising demand for its services to children. “Despite these pressures Cornwall Council and its partners has been able to maintain sufficient specialist roles to work with young offenders and those at risk of offending,” the spokesperson added.\\nMs Egan said Wandsworth has reduced the number of children on remand, but the funding from the Youth Justice Board has reduced by a greater amount and still does not cover the costs.\\nIn 2018-19 the council’s overall budget for this issue was £2.3m. The amount received from the Youth Justice Board was just under £400,000.\\nThe NCA has identified that 9% of county lines operations originate in the West Midlands, the region with the second highest proportion nationally.\\nA report to Birmingham City Council’s cabinet in December last year said the Birmingham Children’s Trust’s youth justice service continues to experience “signiﬁcant pressures” on the remand budget.\\nThe total funding from the Youth Justice Board and the council for remand in 2018-19 is £715,615, while the total cost for 2017-18 was £1.6m.\\nDawn Roberts, assistant director, early help, family support and youth justice at the trust, has played a key role in devising the city’s strategy for protecting children from gangs and criminal exploitation.\\nShe said an oversupply of class A drugs in the city means criminal gangs look to ﬁnd other means of distribution, including through county lines operations.\\nMs Roberts added the strategy has “enabled us to see the world differently” and efforts to reduce crime are seen as “part of a broader safeguarding approach”.\\nIn Lincolnshire the county council has agreed with the police that children who commit a ﬁrst low-level offence are sent to a diversionary panel rather than receiving a caution, which means they do not have a potentially “devastating” criminal record.\\nHeather Sandy, chief officer for education at Lincolnshire CC, said the rationale for this policy “goes beyond budget”, adding: “Councils are faced with signiﬁcant cuts over several years. If we don’t start to be honest about what is making a difference and what is not, then the public sector is going to be in a difficult place.”\\nMs Sandy said the children’s social care system, which “was designed to save babies that were being neglected”, has been adapted as adolescents are increasingly vulnerable to the increase in gang culture and the use of the county lines exploitation business model. This includes treating adolescents and their families as an asset in their decision-making through an educational approach as “bringing them into care is not the answer”.\\nLucy Dacey, Children’s Society national programme manager for disrupting exploitation, said ﬁnancial pressures on councils are having an impact on thresholds for intervention, with some children not receiving support who should. But she said: “The biggest challenge with criminal exploitation in terms of social services is the traditional way social services and social workers assess risk based on neglect and abuse in their familial home.”\\nStuart Gallimore, president of the Association of Directors of Children’s Services, said: “Our sense and our understanding of safeguarding and risk has grown exponentially. “We have to put our hands up, in the past agencies had views about children making choices, making lifestyle choices, almost making a choice to put [themselves at risk].”\\nChart 1\\nSource: National Crime Agency. County lines drug supply, vulnerability and harm 2018\\nChart 2\\nThe numbers\\nnumbers\\n‘This isn’t about young offenders getting away with it’ Youth cautions in Lincolnshire have fallen by more than 90% following an agreement between the police, county council and the youth offending service that young people will not be criminalised for a first offence. Instead, cases are reviewed by panel that meets weekly to consider children and young people who have admitted a criminal offence. Since the introduction of the panel in June 2017, more than 430 cases have been reviewed. The council said a community-based resolution has been used in 82% of all cases heard, reducing youth cautions by over 90%. Patricia Bradwell (Con), executive councillor for children’s services, said: “This isn’t about young offenders getting away with it. “Robust resolutions, with input from victims, mean young people won’t be criminalised, but take part in community action to repair the harm they’ve done. “This is helping to reduce further offending and keep young people out of the youth justice system.” The panel is a partnership between Lincolnshire Police, the county’s Youth Offending Service and Lincolnshire CC’s children’s services.\\nCriminal gangs target excluded children hoodie The number of exclusions in England has been on an upward trajectory since 2013-14. The latest government figures show there was an increase from 6,685 in 2015-16 to 7,720 in 2016-17. Most of these children are sent to pupil referral units, which have been identified by the National Crime Agency as being targeted by criminal gangs for recruitment. Many PRUs, which are funded through the dedicated schools grant, have become academies so do not register in council outturn spending. Despite the upward trend in exclusions, government figures suggest a 2% drop in net spending by councils that registered allocated funding on PRUs every year between 2015-16 and 2017-18. Dawn Roberts, assistant director, early help, family support and youth justice at Birmingham Children’s Trust, said while the trust does not have responsibility for education, the aim is to reduce exclusions, with an ambition to see PRU staff spending more time in mainstream schools working on prevention. She cited one example of a child deliberately getting excluded in order to get allocated to a PRU so he could recruit more pupils to sell drugs. “In people’s minds it is about how do you extend your reach if you are under pressure to also sell,” Ms Roberts added. She said the trust was also trying to use Troubled Families funding to encourage schools to intervene with pupils at an early stage through the programme’s payment by results mechanism. “If [the Troubled Families programme) wasn’t replaced with something that targeted these vulnerable children and families then we would be seeing more need going unmet in the city [and] more coming into the care and criminal justice system,” Ms Roberts said. Heather Sandy, chief officer for education at Lincolnshire CC, said evidence suggests more young people are coming into the county and being arrested for offences such as drug supply than young people living there going out. But she said young people in Lincolnshire are as vulnerable as those elsewhere, with exclusions a key risk. Focus in this area has seen exclusions reduced by 40% in the past two years through working closely with schools. “What that says is all headteachers need to be consistently applying the inclusion framework, so it is not OK for one headteacher to exclude for something fairly trivial and another teacher to put thousands of pounds worth of pastoral support and preventative work in with young people,” Ms Sandy said. As a result, all Lincolnshire headteachers have agreed a minimum standard of intervention they will fund at a school before they access shared resources.',\n",

The effect is a bit like soundproofing, says Stephen Silberstein, a study author and director of the Jefferson Headache Center in Philadelphia.\\n\"You have a kid next door making a lot of noise, you put in soundproofing and all of a sudden you\\'re quiet,\" Silberstein says. \"That\\'s what the antibodies do. They prevent the noise from aggravating the system.\"\\nThe idea is to prevent the full range of migraine symptoms including headache, nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound.\\nSilberstein\\'s study gave monthly or quarterly injections of an antibody called fremanezumab to more than 700 patients who have chronic migraines. \"These patients are having almost daily attacks and they\\'re greatly impaired by it,\" he says.\\nNearly half the people who got the drug experienced fewer migraine attacks. And in some people the attacks all but vanished.\\nIn Goadsby\\'s study, a different antibody called erenumab produced similar results in patients who had up to 14 migraines a month. Neither drug appeared to cause more side effects than a placebo.\\nThe results suggest a brighter future for migraine patients, who have had quite limited options until now, Goadsby says. \"I hope it shows patients that this is not an impossible problem. It\\'s a tractable problem.\"\\nBut the drugs did not work for everyone, and their effectiveness was aided by a powerful placebo effect, says Andrew Hershey, who directs the headache center at Cincinnati Children\\'s Hospital. Even people who got the placebo saw migraine attacks drop by more than 20 percent, meaning the treatment group did better than the placebo group, but not hugely better. Hershey, who was not associated with either study, wrote an editorial accompanying the research.\\nIn it, he describes the benefit of these drugs as \"modest but meaningful.\"\\nAlso, \"every indication is that they will be fairly expensive compounds,\" Hershey says, possibly costing thousands of dollars a month. That means they will probably be reserved for patients who are severely disabled by migraines and haven\\'t been helped by other, less expensive treatments, he says.\\nThe Food and Drug Administration is expected to review the new drugs in the next few months.

He says they act a bit like soundproofing in the brain.\\nSILBERSTEIN: You have a kid next door making a lot of noise. You put soundproofing, and then all of a sudden, you\\'re quiet. That\\'s what the antibodies do. They dampen. They prevent the noise from aggravating the system.\\nHAMILTON: The idea is to prevent the full range of migraine symptoms - headache, nausea and sensitivity to light and sound. And the drug helped nearly half of patients who took it. Most had fewer migraines. A few saw them all but disappear. And in a second, larger study, a different antibody produced similar results. Peter Goadsby, the study\\'s lead author, says antibody drugs represent an important advance.\\nPETER GOADSBY: They offer the first migraine treatment that\\'s actually aimed at the disorder - so a migraine treatment for migraine patients.\\nHAMILTON: Goadsby, a professor of neurology at King\\'s College in London, says, until now, migraine patients have relied on drugs meant to treat epilepsy or depression or high blood pressure.\\nGOADSBY: We give them a choice between, like, a beta blocker where they\\'ll feel tired, or we tell them that they can go on an antidepressant, which will make them sleepy and put on weight.\\nHAMILTON: Goadsby says the antibody treatments don\\'t seem to produce side effects. And he says their success means that it\\'s possible to develop better migraine drugs.\\nGOADSBY: I hope it shows patients that this is not an impossible problem. It\\'s a tractable problem.\\nHAMILTON: Both studies were published in The New England Journal of Medicine, so was an editorial by Andrew Hershey, who directs the Headache Center at Cincinnati Children\\'s Hospital. In it, Hershey describes the benefit to patients as modest but meaningful.\\nANDREW HERSHEY: So the modest part is that most of them only had about a two-day improvement over placebo.\\nHAMILTON: In other words, they might average eight days a month with migraines instead of 10. Hershey also says use of these drugs may be limited by their cost.\\nHERSHEY: Every indication is they will probably be fairly expensive compounds, which means that they probably will not be first line.\\nHAMILTON: The Food and Drug Administration is expected to review the new drugs in the next few months. One or both could reach the market in 2018.\\nJon Hamilton, NPR News. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.',\n",

The initial list of what NHS England describes as ‘low value’ drugs are absolutely essential for the patients that need them, furthermore, it is to be expanded to include many more drugs.\\nThe list includes the vital drug Liothyronine for treating underactive thyroid, Fentanyl, a drug to treat pain in terminally ill patients and Doxazosin, a drug used to control high blood pressure.\\n‘Stripping away funding for medicines is the product of deliberate government plans to shrink our NHS,’ Keith Taylor a Green MEP said yesterday.\\nHe added: ‘Government policies are systematically defunding and undermining Britain’s beloved healthcare service. The painkillers for terminally ill patients, thyroid treatments, high blood pressure drugs and travel vaccines on the NHS Clinical Commissioners’ ten-strong hit list are far from “low value” to the patients that rely on them.\\n‘This should be a wake-up call for patients, politicians and anybody interested in stopping our health service being dismantled right before our eyes. What happens when the medicines you rely on are suddenly labelled “low value”?\\n‘Will we soon see patients forced to search for alternative, less effective medicines while manufacturers exploit the opportunity to increase over the counter costs?

       " 'The new AU Plan of Action on Drugs Control (2019-2023) includes a commitment to review and collate drug policies across the region and provide continuous support of the epidemiology network and its research across the region. (Photo: Gallo Images / City Press / Leon Sadiki)\\nIt is imperative that African countries put an immediate end to the criminalisation of people who use drugs, the possession of drugs for personal use, and of subsistence farmers.\\nIt is deeply worrying that the fundamental rights of people who use drugs are constantly compromised by hostile supply reduction activities and the criminalisation of minor non-violent drug offences.\\nAll too often, governments are quick to blame drugs and drug users for so many lives lost, while forgetting the impact of drug control mechanisms that are causing more harm than the drugs themselves. The negative impacts of the criminalisation of people who use drugs continue to raise serious concerns in most African countries. Every individual has a right to access life-saving health services without fear of punishment or discrimination.\\nHowever, fear of criminal sanctions generally drives people who use drugs away from proven, effective harm reduction services, leading to infections and premature death from HIV, hepatitis C and overdose. This notion has most recently been recognised by all UN agencies in their new Common Position on Drugs.\\nThe ‘war on drugs’ has failed woefully\\nDrug use and possession is still within the “moral debate”. This makes the promotion of the needs of people who use drugs globally, an uphill task. Some sections of society believe that people who use drugs are morally weak or deserve to be punished. The stigma is even greater in Africa when that person is a woman. This is why the purported “war on drugs” is considered acceptable and easily implemented in many parts of Africa.\\nThe punishment of a crime must be proportionate to the crime committed. Yet millions of people continue to be imprisoned or are handed more severe sentences for possession or use of controlled drugs. Sentences for low-level, non-violent drug crimes tend to be disproportionately high. In many contexts, those suspected of drug offences are beaten, tortured, or imprisoned for life – while some countries still resort to the death penalty or extrajudicial killings.\\nSmall-scale subsistence farmers involved in the cultivation of drug-linked crops are also criminalised despite the lack of other sustainable livelihood options. Since the declaration of the “war on drugs” more than 50 years ago, it was felt this tough approach would reduce demand and supply. This has clearly not happened, and the negative consequences are increasingly clear. In reality, we should lay the blame on the architects of the disastrous drug war, the lack of political will to find real solutions, and societal apathy generated by decades of stigma and discrimination against persons who use drugs.\\nA new approach to the drug situation\\nGovernments must begin to question the effectiveness of existing drug control mechanisms. They need to acknowledge that punitive enforcement has proven expensive and counterproductive and to reorient towards pragmatic health and harm reduction approaches that have been shown to minimise the effects of drugs on people who use them.\\nIt is imperative to put an immediate end to the criminalisation of people who use drugs, the possession of drugs for personal use, and of subsistence farmers. Governments also need to address disproportionate sentences for other drug offences.\\nIn addition, governments must focus on ending the continuous violations of human rights experienced by people who use drugs – justified by law enforcement agencies due to their goal of achieving a drug-free society. In reality, this is an illusion that is not attainable. Prohibition has never worked in the history of humankind. We need to rethink our drug policies.\\nGlobal drug policy needs to be built on firm human rights, health and development principles. Currently, there is no consensus among governments on drugs and human rights – and huge disparities in positions and practices. However, the existence of regional bodies like the African Union and Economic Community of West African States provides an institutional bedrock which can steer the process of reviewing drug policies to promote harm reduction practices in the region as a whole.\\nGovernments can move the debate forward by calling for more human-centred objectives and measurable indicators for the future. They need to shift the objectives of drug policy away from “process measures” such as crop eradication statistics, arrest rates, drug seizures and imprisonment statistics.\\nSuccess needs to be measured with a focus on the impacts on health, security and development. Indicators such as reduced drug-related deaths, increased coverage and quality of harm reduction and drug treatment services, reduced incidence of HIV, and increased availability of controlled medicines for pain and palliative care in Africa all need to be taken into account.\\nFurthermore, there is an urgent need to improve social and economic indicators in areas of drug production, and for increased provision of equitable and environmentally sustainable development programmes, and advances in achieving these goals. And finally, ending human rights violations and abuses against affected populations, the establishment of rigorous and effective human rights monitoring mechanisms to ensure compliance by governments and law enforcement agencies, putting in place comprehensive access to health, social and legal protections with adequate access to justice and legal aid for victims of human rights abuses.\\nFor a more forward-looking response to the world drug situation, there is a need to promote a balanced and integrated approach. Evidence-based responses should be the standard for countries to enable them to curb the health and social consequences of drugs.\\nGovernments need to begin to make efforts to address the drug situation through the adoption of various methods and strategies. The African Union continues to demonstrate strong commitment to addressing the drug situation in the region by facilitating the availability of a wide range of evidence-based treatment options, including opioid substitution therapy (OST).\\nThe new AU Plan of Action on Drugs Control (2019-2023) was recently adopted by member states during the third Specialised Technical Committee meeting in Cairo from 29 July to 2 August 2019, and member states called for harm reduction services to be made available.

It includes a commitment to review and collate drug policies across the region and provide continuous support of the epidemiology network and its research across the region. The action plan further calls for alternatives to punishment for people who use drugs instead of the present status quo being implemented by many countries.\\nWhat is the future?\\nThe future looks promising for the region. The adoption of the AU Plan of Action on Drugs Control (2019-2023) can pave the way for member states to adopt a different evidence-based stance away from punitive approaches, which have consistently proved not to work and exacerbated problems related to drug use by creating a system that marginalises already vulnerable communities.\\nThe action plan requests countries to make available comprehensive accessible evidence-based, and human rights-based drug use prevention, dependence treatment and after-care services.\\nMost importantly, people need not die in pain, fear or helplessness because of mechanisms that do not allow access to essential medicines for those who truly need them.\\nWe must rethink drug policy in Africa.

Set for release on November 22, the EP continues to develop the deep musical relationship the duo share that transcends the drum & bass they’re best known for.\\nBuilding on previous collaborations on the label – City Lights on Forza Horizon 4 and Take It Off on Hospitality On The Beach 2019, plus Clair De Lune on Bop’s Microfunk imprint – Love & Other Drugs is an explorative body of work that takes in influences of indie pop and UK garage as well as the cosmic, deep sheen the pair have both become synonymous with.\\nIt’s just the beginning, too. More music is already confirmed for January 2020 and beyond. Freshly announced by Hospital today, we squeezed the Moscow / St Petersburg duo for a little more information on how their newly formed pact came to be.\\nWhen did you two meet?\\nBop: I think we met at one of the events we were performing. It was around that time when Hospital was releasing Future Sounds Of Russia.\\nSubwave: I suppose about ten years ago. I first heard Alex’s tracks on Med School and really liked his style and production skills. It’s hard to remember when we met for the first time. I’m sure it was some drum and bass gig.\\nWhen did you start making music together?\\nSubwave: In 2010 I remixed Bop’s Song About My Dog. Then our first collaboration was Clair De Lune on his label Microfunk.\\nBop: Gleb took a couple of years off drum & bass and travelled the world as part of a pop band, when he started to produce D&B again I asked for the collab and that’s how we made Clair De Lune.\\nTime to big each other up… Why do you think you work so well together?\\nSubwave: I think we understand what we want and we have similar taste in music. He also has great production skills, musical intuition, and really good sense of humour 😉\\nBop: I think Gleb has great sense of style and melody. I often tend to over-complicate my songs and I think Subwave does the opposite. He tends to make song work with as little elements as possible so I think together we found a good balance between simple and complicated. He can come up with a catchy groove very fast and has great intuition for vocals.\\nHow would you describe the music you’ve made together so far?\\nBop: Adjectives that come to mind is soft, sensual, atmospheric, futuristic, minimalistic, indie electronic music.\\nSubwave: Deep Minimal drum and bass with sexy influences.\\nBop & Subwave – Love & Other Drugs is out November 22.

       " \"I’m not going to be writing about the war on drugs and human rights; instead, I have an even more important issue: life-saving medicines and how intellectual property rights can trample on human rights.\\nThe year was 1949 and the world had seen, especially during World War II, the miracles of penicillin and related antibiotics.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nBut many people had allergies to that group of antibiotics and so could not benefit from the cures.\\nDrug companies were looking for alternatives to the penicillins, including the giant Eli Lilly. In Iloilo, Eli Lilly had a Filipino physician, Abelardo Aguilar, who worked for them as a detailman (drug representative). As a physician, he knew what was entailed in research for antibiotics and set out doing that on his own, discovering some soil from the Molo cemetery that exhibited antibacterial activity.\\nHe sent the soil to Eli Lilly and, in 1952, the company announced a breakthrough—a new antibiotic called erythromycin, developed from Aguilar’s samples. Through the years, erythromycin and related antibiotics have saved countless lives from infections of the upper respiratory tract and the urinary tract.\\nThis year then, we should be celebrating the 70th anniversary of the discovery of erythromycin and the role of a Filipino physician in that breakthrough. But Eli Lilly claimed the patent rights on the antibiotic and never publicly credited Aguilar. They did at least give the brand names Ilotycin and Ilosone to the new antibiotic, an acknowledgment of the drug’s origins.\\nAguilar appealed to Eli Lilly first to at least allow him to visit the company’s erythromycin plant in the States. Nothing. He eventually left Eli Lilly and went into private practice, and was known as a doctor of the poor.\\nLate in life, he again wrote Eli Lilly, upping the ante now (I suspect partly out of spite) to US$500 million, which he said he would put into a foundation to help the poor.\\nHe died in 1993, never getting any concessions from Eli Lilly. His daughter, Ma. Elena Aguilar Paguntalan, took up his deathbed wishes to continue the fight. The controversy caught the attention of government officials, including then Health Secretary Juan Flavier, but nothing came out of their efforts.\\nThen the media came in. The Inquirer featured a series of articles by Bobby Timonera and a scathing op-ed by Conrado de Quiros, titled “Greed.”\\nIn 1995, Eli Lilly’s director for international corporate affairs finally wrote Paguntalan, explaining that “no company employee involved with research and development of any compound, regardless of where they are employed in our global organization, receives royalties or compensation for that work beyond his or her salary and benefits.”\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nI was aware of erythromycin’s being discovered in the Philippines and the relationship of that discovery to the brand name Ilosone, but had forgotten the connection until University of the Philippines Diliman vice chancellor Evangeline Amor told me about her attending a conference in Iloilo that discussed natural products as a source of medicines.\\nOne of the main organizers of the conference was Dr. Doralyn Dalisay, a Balik Scientist now with the University of San Agustin in Iloilo, who came up with a different “Never Again” reminder during the meeting. This was a reference to the 70th anniversary of erythromycin and its Iloilo origins, as well as Aguilar not having received proper recognition and benefits.\\nThe patents system has always been unfair—patents cornered by large companies that control research. The Philippines follows a patent system that protects companies’ rights not just for the product but over processes, meaning even if someone can find a way of producing the same product using a different process, they would not be allowed to do so. With their patents, drug companies end up dictating high prices for the medicines.\\nResearchers like Dr. Dalisay at the University of San Agustin hope to learn from history. She and others are once again looking for antibiotics, an urgent mission given widespread antibiotic resistance. She is looking again at Actinobacteria, the same kind of microorganisms that led to erythromycin’s discovery, but this time from marine sediments.\\nIf I may, I’m pleased to say UP Diliman is in partnership with San Agustin and others for this kind of important research. If there’s “rampant drug use” in UP as has been claimed in the media lately, it is in the sense of looking for new drugs—from powerful painkillers to antibiotics—on land and in the seas.\\nDr. Dalisay has presented very promising findings from their antibiotics research. She is determined that this research, now conducted by Filipinos, and with our own research funds, will benefit Filipinos.\\n[email protected]\\nRead Next\\nEDITORS' PICK\\nMOST READ\",\n",

Start the healing.”\\nBut Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is adamant that the killings will go on precisely because the country needs healing — from drugs.\\nOfficially around 4,000 people have been killed in police counter-narcotics operations since Duterte took office in mid-2016. Over 2,000 others have died in drug-related killings, some attributed to gang turf wars, and several thousand more again have been shot in unsolved murders.\\nThe exact number of dead is unknown due to what the United Nations believes to be differences in terminology in official reports as well as the slow progress of investigations.\\nLast week Duterte returned the handling of his anti-drugs effort to police after temporarily giving control of the campaign to the small specialist drug enforcement agency.\\nMaking the handover announcement, the president told critics to “go to hell” and deemed the move necessary as the Philippines had turned into “a narco state.”\\nIf the Philippines is indeed a narco state, then it suggests that the “war on drugs” is not working as planned. After taking office last year Duterte said he needed 6 months to prosecute the campaign, but that timeframe has been extended four times and the latest deadline is now a year away.\\nTwice Duterte has taken the drugs campaign out of police hands — firstly because they were accused of murdering a South Korean businessman and the second time out of what the president said was “deference” to critics among foreign governments and the Catholic Church.\\nThe most recent temporary suspension came in October, a month before the Philippines hosted a major Asian summit that included the final leg of U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent tour of the region.\\nThough Duterte endorses a take-no-prisoners approach to drugs, at the same time he surely did not want headlines about police shooting teenagers — a regular newspaper splash since he took office — while he was feting President Trump and other government leaders from around the Pacific.\\nTrump was given the central seat next to Duterte during the formal dinner -– a table that included heavyweights such as China, India and Japan.\\nFears that the two tetchy grandfathers might prove too alike — and their meeting would end up in a flare-up — proved unfounded. Trump did not criticize the drug war and the two leaders scoffed at some shared enemies.\\n“President Trump knows too well that he can’t raise issues that are sensitive as far as the Philippine president is concerned,” said Bobby Tuazon of the Center for People Empowerment in Governance, citing Duterte’s determination to avoid deferring to the U.S.\\nHarry Roque, a Philippines government spokesman, said the two presidents bonded over a common dislike of former US President Barack Obama, who Duterte called “a son of a bitch” because Obama criticized the drug war.\\nAfter the usual photo op and opening remarks at one of the various meetings, Duterte said it was time for the press, who he described as “spies,” to leave — getting a laugh out of Trump despite the fact that 78 journalists have been murdered in the Philippines in the last 25 years.\\nBut by the end of the summit Duterte seemed agitated by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who said he had raised his concerns about the drug war with Duterte.\\nTrudeau, who seemed as interested in posing for selfies with star-struck reporters as he did in his meetings, described Duterte as “receptive” during a what he said was “cordial” meeting but later the same day Duterte accused Trudeau of offending the Philippines.\\nThen, using a word that rhymes with duck, the Philippine president told the European Union not to interfere with his country’s sovereignty. He then said that a visiting UN official nearly made him fall out of his chair with what he deemed stupid comments about the drug war.\\nWith the Philippine economy among Asia’s fastest-growing and Duterte telling Filipinos to expect much-needed road and rail investment from China, the president is no more inclined to listen to domestic opposition than he is to foreigners.\\nThe Philippines electoral system means that the president and vice president are elected separately, so winners can come from opposing parties, as is the case with Duterte and vice president Leni Robredo. But Robredo’s criticism of the drug war has left her isolated and sidelined by the rest of the government.\\nAnother member of the opposition, Senator Leila de Lima, is in jail, accused by police of drug trafficking. Duterte called de Lima “an immoral woman” and accused her of having an affair with her driver — an echo of the same bar-stool bluntness and rakish put-downs that helped Duterte to a landslide election win last year.\\nSuch rhetoric — and an army of social media supporters, bots included — helps the president stay popular despite the brutality of the drug war.\\nA couple of days before his rant about the EU and the UN, Duterte gave speech to local corporate bosses at one of Manila’s huge casinos.\\nHe touched on some serious subjects, such as the implications for the region of China’s growing economic and military strength.\\nBut he signed off with some typical repartee, drawing laughs from the the high roller crowd.\\nBantering with his security team, he told them to allow people approach him for selfies.\\n“I want to meet everybody, especially the ladies,” said the president, who during his election campaign had talked up the virtues of Viagra and made glib and insensitive comments about the 1989 gang-rape and murder of an Australian woman in Davao, the southern Philippine city where he was mayor\\n“If you want to have a picture with me, fine..[..]..I’ll pull you in,” Duterte chuckled, adding, ambiguously, that “nothing comes free in this world.”\\nFor World Report, this is Simon Roughneen in Manila\\nFollow us on Twitter Follow @Arevico',\n",

Those who avoid experimenting with drugs when they are young are less likely to do so later on.\\nAccording to the World Drug Report 2020, an estimated 269 million people internationally consume illegal drugs.

       " 'NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has asked the country’s technical advisory body on drugs to decide on the fate of more than 300 combination medicines banned by the government between March 2016 and June 2017. The order is a potential relief to drug makers who have argued that the government did not consult statutory bodies provided for in the country\\'s drug regulations before banning these drugs.Companies can make and sell the 349 contested fixed dose combination drugs FDCs ) while Drugs Technical Advisory Board ( DTAB ) deliberates on the issue.At the same time, the court also clarified that this order is specific to two of the government\\'s ban notifications due to “peculiar facts” of the cases.In an order dictated in open court on two government notifications banning these FDCs, a Supreme Court bench of Justices Rohinton Fali Nariman and Sanjay Kishan Kaul on Thursday said it was setting aside the ban on 15 such drugs which were manufactured in India before 1988.However, if it chooses to, the government can carry out further inquiry on whether these drugs should continue to be marketed in the country, the court suggested.For the remaining 334 FDCs, the court suggested that DTAB should decide whether the manufacture and sale of these drugs should be regulated, restricted or outright banned, and submit a report with its recommendations to the government within six months.The bench will pronounce its official judgment on Friday.FDCs are cocktail drugs that contain two or more therapeutic ingredients packed in a single dose.While 344 of the contested drugs are currently available in the market as the Delhi High Court in December last quashed the ban on them imposed in March last year, the other five FDCs banned in June, too, can now return to the market.The Supreme Court bench said DTAB or a sub-committee it sets up should hear arguments by the drug industry as well as patient group All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN), which is in favour of the ban notifications, before preparing its report.The government is expected to carefully consider this report, “apply its mind” and accordingly either maintain or modify its ban notifications, according to it.The Kokate committee — the government’s expert committee that had studied the FDCs and declared them “irrational” — was not clear as to the reasoning behind its decision, it observed.The top court last month said the government does not have to consult statutory bodies like DTAB before banning FDCs as such consultations were not specified in Section 26A of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. The government had used Section 26A, which defines its power to regulate the manufacture and sale of drugs \"in public interest\", to ban these drugs last year on a separate expert committee\\'s recommendation.“The judgment means that the government need not mandatorily consult DTAB to prohibit the manufacture and sale of FDCs it finds irrational and can use expert committees like the Kokate committee,” said S Srinivasan, a member of AIDAN. “Earlier, the Delhi High Court had quashed the ban only on the reasoning that DTAB was not consulted, but now the government has been empowered to act fast,” he said. “The only drawback is that six months seems too short a deadline to achieve all this,” he added.AIDAN’s counsel Colin Gonsalves told the court on Thursday that there are 40,000 contested and debated FDCs in India, while any well-regulated country allows 500 FDCs at most.Lawyers representing drug makers said the decision is a victory for the industry.“The court has referred the matter for a fresh look to decide if the drugs require to be banned under Section 26A of the Drugs & Cosmetics Act,” said Ashish Prasad, partner at Economic Laws Practice, who represented Indian Drug Manufacturers Association (IDMA), Federation of Pharma Entrepreneurs (FOPE) and Confederation of Indian Pharmaceutical Industries (CIPI) during the proceedings.Archana Sahadeva, associate partner at Singh & Singh Law Firm, who represented drug makers such as Cipla, MacLeods, Alembic and Microlabs, said, “This means that the process will now be more transparent.”The 300 plus contested drugs include popular brands such as Corex, Phensedyl, D’Cold Total, Vicks Action 500 Extra and Saridon.',\n",

Thirty five year old Josexelly Mendez Wanzeler appeared nervous after disembarking from an Ethiopian airlines flight late on January the thirtieth. When airport police carried out an x-ray, the image revealed a number of packets in her stomach. Josexelly confessed that she swallowed 60 condoms full of cocaine before flying to Thailand.

       " 'The U.S demand for drugs is a highly profitable business, with Americans reportedly spending about $150 billion in 2016 on drugs like cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamines.\\nExperts say tougher border security has not stopped cartels from smuggling drugs. Instead, it has only pushed them to get more creative.\\n\"We have 11- and 12-year-old kids already being approached to smuggle narcotics. There is no age limit for this, cartels will look for those more vulnerable and the first opportunity they have, they\\'ll take it,\" said Alan Regalado with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\\nRELATED MAP: Cartel influences, presence across the United States and Mexico\\nABC15 investigators exposed the newest tactic from drug cartels in Arizona: recruiting kids as young as 11 years old, from all walks of life and backgrounds, to smuggle drugs for the cartel.\\nHow are they being recruited?\\nThe ABC15 investigators went to the U.S./Mexico border near Nogales to find out why cartels are now targeting Valley children.\\n“They are using females more than males, even Caucasian females and males, to do the transshipment of narcotics,” said Raul Rodriguez, a detective for the Santa Cruz County Attorney\\'s Office.\\nRodriguez said cartels are running out of teens to recruit in the Nogales metro area, so now they are recruiting in places where no one expects them. He says cartels use social media, video games, word of mouth, or trips to Mexico as some of the paths to recruitment.\\n“A kid from Glendale, Peoria, Mesa can come down here with friends or relatives. They said they are just going to spend the day and go back, but within a couple of hours they are recruited,” said Rodriguez.\\n“The community needs to know, the community needs to do something about it,” said Alan Regalado, spokesperson for the Tucson sector of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\\nAlarming spike in the number of Valley children busted for smuggling\\n“We\\'ve had young people from this community being arrested near the border for smuggling reasons,” said Regalado. He added that the spike in the number of Valley children busted for smuggling is alarming.\\nAccording to CBP, between 2017 and 2018, more than 300 kids have been picked up for smuggling humans or drugs. They say drugs are in their vehicles, taped to their bodies, swallowed or stuffed into body cavities.\\n“(If) one of those packages ruptures, that juvenile can die,” said Santa Cruz County Attorney George Silva.\\nSilva said many kids think being underage protects them from prosecution, but that is incorrect.\\n“In Arizona, there\\'s a statute that specifically says that children under 18 can be prosecuted as adults if they\\'re 14,15,16,17 and they committed a class two felony.”\\nSilva prosecutes minors as adults on a case-by-case basis, but stresses that the mandatory minimum prison time is 3.5 years. “That\\'s the least that they\\'re going to do if they go to trial and got convicted.”\\nSilva says there is a misconception that only kids from Hispanic backgrounds are at risk. He says cartels do not discriminate.\\n“The majority of people that are getting arrested right now for trafficking hard drugs through our port of entry are white.”\\nBorder Patrol agent Alan Regalado said they are also dealing with southbound smuggling -- American teens trafficking weapons, ammunition, and money into Mexico.\\n“Don\\'t think it won\\'t happen to your kid because it may,” said Regalado.\\n“It makes me popular.\"\\nRegalado tells ABC15 they have seen kids from all kinds of communities falling into the hands of cartel recruiters.\\n“We’ve seen kids with parents that have given them everything material, and we ask them, \\'Why did you do it? You really didn\\'t need it,\\' and they said, ‘I know, but it makes me popular.’\"\\n“I found five assault rifles and a bulletproof vest.”\\nABC15 investigators interviewed a Valley mother who believes her son was recruited by cartel members.\\n“I found five assault rifles and a bulletproof vest. I thought I was going to die, I panicked,” said “Alicia.”\\nABC15 has agreed to not reveal Alicia\\'s identity for fear of retaliation.\\nAlicia thinks her son was recruited by the cartel to store their guns, saying, “They\\'re using my son. He wasn\\'t like that.”\\nShe said her son\\'s behavior changed and she was afraid of him, and for him. She reported him to police.\\n“I know he didn\\'t want to hurt people, but I can\\'t say the same about the cartel.”\\nRegalado said many kids recruited were just like Alicia’s son.\\n“We see kids that ended up smuggling that wanted to go to college that come from a good community and they just don\\'t understand why they made that decision.”\\nThe U.S Customs and Border Protection, along with Phoenix Police, will be having a free symposium for the community on this topic on November 14, at 6pm at Carl Hayden High School Auditorium. The high school auditorium is located at 3333 W Roosevelt St, Phoenix, AZ.',\n",

He told a detective his daughter had done this before – and that it had been going on for years.\\nOn Sept. 25, Mr. Garcia’s daughter was charged with possession of a controlled substance, child abuse and conspiracy to commit child abuse.\\nADVERTISEMENTSkip\\n................................................................\\nDays later, Mr. Garcia kicked his daughter out of the home and filed for guardianship of her three children – two boys and a girl, the youngest one 9 – alleging in court records that his daughter is “mentally and physically unable to take care of children.”\\nMr. Garcia’s daughter “has been, and is currently, on street drugs. She has placed all three kids in danger by having the kids purchase meth for her,” his court filings state.\\nThe grandfather declined to comment for this story.\\nBernalillo County sheriff’s deputy Alex Apodaca said deputies were asked to stand by and “keep the peace” when the daughter came by to collect her belongings, but the woman ended up giving them a mouthful about her father kicking her out.\\n“And we’re like, ‘No it’s not his fault this is happening, it’s yours. You’re the one consuming meth in front of your kids, that’s why you got arrested the other day,’ ” Apodaca said. ” ‘He’s trying to be a good grandpa to his grandkids, you’re apparently not trying to be a good mother.’ ”\\nAccording to a search warrant affidavit filed in state District Court, on Sept. 25 deputies responded to Mr. Garcia’s South Valley home around 6 p.m. after the grandfather called 911.\\nApodaca helped search the home, and, three days later, the encounter was still stuck in the back of his mind.\\n“They seemed like great kids, … two boys, and a 9-year-old girl,” he said. “… They’re like, ‘Hey, I think my mom hides her meth over here in this room.’ ”\\nThe kids were right. Deputies found meth, suboxone and some burnt up foil.\\nDeputies say Mr. Garcia told them he grew suspicious when his daughter told one of her sons to go to the park. He suspected it was “to pick up drugs.”\\n“What did you get?” the grandfather asked the boy when he returned from the park. He told deputies his grandson was “scared and did not want to tell him.”\\nThe grandfather searched the boy and found “two powdery white-colored rocks” of meth in a piece of paper, which he gave to deputies, according to the affidavit.\\nDeputies say they spoke with the grandson, who told them his mother had given him money and sent him to get “the stuff” from the “Cuban guy” at the park. The boy said he handed the guy the cash and was handed “the stuff” in return.\\nAccording to the complaint, the boy’s mother confirmed his story.\\nWhen asked why she sent her son instead of getting the drugs herself, she told deputies, “It was just a fast, stupid decision.” She said she “uses meth occasionally, about every two months,” but she insisted that she “is a responsible parent with a job.”\\nBefore being hauled off to jail, the woman told deputies her father is “always trying to get her in trouble.”\\n“These cases are always delicate,” said Maggie Shepard, the spokeswoman for the Law Offices of the Public Defender, which is defending the woman. “We have not received the evidence in this case, yet, so we still have very little information at this stage. We look forward to getting a better picture as the case progresses.”\\nThe three children told deputies their mother kept pipes for smoking drugs in her dresser and purse while she stashed the drugs under her mattress and sometimes in a black box.\\nDeputies say the children told them their mother smokes the drugs in her bedroom or the bathroom and she would “search around for white things on the floor.”\\n“We’re like, ‘How crazy that you know what meth looks like, that you know this,’ ” Apodaca said. “…Good lord, you’re 9 years old. You know your mom’s smoking something illegal.'”\\nEditor’s note: The Journal is not publishing full names in this story to protect the identities of the children.\\nFor the full project:\",\n",

       " 'Steni Simon By\\nExpress News Service\\nTHIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Rcently, the police arrested three youths and detained a minor boy engaged in the sale of ganja in a rented house at Powdikonam which falls under the Sreekaryam police station limits. The adult accused were identified as Ananthu, 20, of Manchavilakom, his younger brother Vishnu, 19, and Shan, 18, of Punnamoodu. The police seized 128 small packets of ganja which weighed nearly 1kg in total.\\nOn Wednesday, the Railway Protection Force (RPF) anti-narcotic squad at the Ernakulam Junction railway station arrested two youths, Thomas A M, 24, of Malappuram and Sreethu P Shaji, 24, of Kollam, for being engaged in the sale of ganja. They were found to be carrying 11kg of dry ganja worth Rs 5.5 lakh. The ganja was being brought from Coimbatore to Ernakulam for sale in Fort Kochi and Mattancherry areas, according to the preliminary interrogation of the accused persons.\\nNumbers speak\\nThese are not isolated incidents. The youths in Kerala are falling prey to narcotic substances and are also a part of a bigger racket involved in the sale of ganja among school and college students.According to the data with the Kerala State Excise Department, 5,171 Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act cases were detected till August this year in which 5,374 persons were arrested in the state. In 2018, 7,573 NDPS cases were registered in which 7,798 persons were arrested in the state. The majority of the accused are aged between 19 and 30 years.\\nThe department has confiscated about 1,965kg of ganja until August this year and 1,884kg in the same period in 2018. Besides, 88.042kg of hashish, 46.4 grams of heroin and 18 grams of LSD have been seized till August this year, while 65.942kg of hashish, 39 grams of heroin and 6.4 grams of LSD were seized by the excise department in 2018.\\n“Drug peddling among teenagers in the state is a cause for concern. Peddlers rely on technology (e-commerce sites) for buying drugs. In the recent incident in Ernakulam, the accused said that there is a high demand for narcotic substances among college students. They are also using different ways to use these narcotic substances,” a source said.\\nWhat psychiatrists say\\nAccording to psychiatrists, curiosity and peer pressure in colleges have led several youngsters to fall prey to drug abuse. They now use marijuana, injectable drugs, synthetic drugs, mushrooms and other kinds of psychotropic drugs. “Six years ago, we used to get cases of alcohol addiction in which the accused were mostly above 30 years. But now, the scenario has changed and there are cases of youngsters in the 18-20 age group who are addicted to drugs. The majority are addicted to cannabis and nicotine but new substances are also being used,” said Sheena G Soman, consultant psychiatrist, Mental Health Centre, Thiruvananthapuram. Girls above 17 years who were found to be using drugs have also been reported. “Non-psychotropic substances are available online. In a week, we get about four to five cases of drug abuse where the majority are teenagers,” said Sheena. Experts also say that there are cases of children below 18 addicted to drugs. There is also a demand for separate de-addiction centres for adolescents as there are chances they might build connections with the adults housed in the mental health centres to source drugs.',\n",
       " 'Health workers also explained that they are under intense pressure from clinic owners to meet certain revenue targets.\\nHealth & Science\\n“Sometimes clinics want to offload near-expiry drugs\"\\nMany patients are being prescribed excessive medicines as hospitals offload near-expiry stocks.A recent survey among 21,913 patients in Nairobi recorded huge over-prescriptions especially of antibiotics - well over and above recommended levels. One of the reasons for the over-prescription, the report says was for health facilities to offload near-expiry medicines and improve on revenues. “When it comes to private clinics, you also have other goals . . . you have target revenues,” said a medical doctor. Researchers analysed mobile phone data in the donor supported M-TIBA programme where majority of hospital visits were due to respiratory tract infections.\\nSEE ALSO: Health workers will now receive allowances\\nThese infections included common cold, bronchitis, tonsillitis and other conditions some not normally recommended for antibiotics.\\nHigh degrees\\nPlos One\\nHowever, the study published recently in the journalshows antibiotics prescriptions rates for respiratory infections going up to 99.8 per cent. “These high degrees of prescription surpass levels recommended by national and international standard treatment guidelines,” says the study by Dutch researchers and the Gertrude’s Children’s Hospital, Nairobi. The eight-month study, analysed 36,210 visits at four clinics in Nairobi involving 21,913 patients with 85,484 prescriptions. It indicates only a few of the treatments were supported by comprehensive laboratory tests. Official treatment guidelines recommend no antibiotics for infections such as common cold and bronchitis, a major cause of hospital visits in Kenya. In this study, the antibiotic amoxicillin constituted nearly one-third 7,061 or 32.3 per cent of total antibiotic drug prescriptions.\\nSEE ALSO: Healthworkers to get allowances\\nIn August, the World Health Organisation, warned of fake Augmentin (usually a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid) pills circulating in Kenya. “Money first. Guys go straight to the more expensive Amoxil-Clavulanic combination . . . they tend to think about money first,” said a doctor in the current study. Health workers also explained that they are under intense pressure from clinic owners to meet certain revenue targets. “You are not going to prescribe drugs worth Sh100 and yet you have the original drug worth Sh3,000. So, you will tend to move towards the more expensive drugs, and keep away from the cheap drugs that are supposed to be used at first,” said another medical doctor. In February 2019, the annual conference of the Kenya Medical Research Institute was told of widespread sale of substandard amoxicillin in many retail pharmacies in Nairobi. The researchers reported purchasing samples from retail pharmacies in seven wards in Nairobi - the CBD, Karen, South C, South B, Zimmerman, Kayole and Kibra.\\nSEE ALSO: Health workers extend strike notice to Monday\\nAfter laboratory analysis, 46 per cent of the samples were confirmed to be of poor quality. In the current study, however, the researchers asked patients’ and healthcare providers the cause of excessive drug prescriptions. “Sometimes clinics want to offload near-expiry drugs,” said a clinical officer. Some distributors give doctors or clinics huge discounts on near-expiring drugs for the quick offload on patients. The Kenya Health System Assessment report published in June 2019 by the Ministry of Health and USAID said Kenya has the fourth highest Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) reporting rate in Africa.\\nOver-prescription\\nOther reasons for over-prescription in the current study was due to high patient load, clinician and patient perceptions that clinicians should prescribe, lack of access to laboratory tests and the use of obsolete treatment guidelines.\\nSEE ALSO: Medics now want risk, commuter allowances\\nThe health workers were especially worried over an increasing number of ‘Google-patients’ in Kenya. “These are patients who already have the symptoms; they turn to Google, then come to you in a panic, and get annoyed when you do not give them antibiotics,” said a doctor.',\n",
       " 'MILWAUKEE – Every night, a slew of TV commercials hammer home the benefits of drugs that treat autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis – and tack on a reminder about the risks they carry.\\nMore than most, Tom Leith knows the possible perils.\\nOver the last 20 years, he has been on three of the drugs for his rheumatoid arthritis: Enbrel, Orencia and Rituxan.\\nIn that time, he has had at least two serious medical problems: A life-threatening case of viral meningitis in 2017 and, a short time later, a suspected cancerous tumor on his lung. Doctors say both could be related to the drugs, but there is no way to know for sure.\\nThe drugs are known as biologic medicines, or biologics. Made from living organisms, such as animal cells, instead of chemicals, they have flooded the market over the last two decades – bringing with them promise and pitfalls.\\nBy tamping down overactive immune systems, the drugs can lead to substantial improvement, even remission. But in doing so, they leave patients more susceptible to sometimes-deadly infections and other serious side effects.\\nIn many cases, the problems emerged only after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration deemed the drugs safe and effective treatments and allowed them on the market.\\nTom Leith and his wife, Kathy, look over his medical records. Leith, 64, was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in 1983 and was told he eventually would need a wheelchair. Thanks to a variety of drugs, including biologic medicines, he has continued to walk without the need for a wheelchair.\\nAt least 25 times since 2000, the FDA or drug manufacturers have issued warnings, safety updates or found potential signals of serious risk with the drugs, a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel analysis found.\\nOf the 21 biologic drugs that have won FDA approval, 13 – 62% – have received the agency’s most stringent warning, known as a “black box.” In the majority of those, the warnings were added when new problems were identified after the drugs were on the market.\\nThat’s more than the percentage of warnings found in a 2017 study of new drugs. That study, published in JAMA, found that of 222 drugs that got on the market between 2001 and 2010, 27% later received a black box warning.\\nThe individual risks from biologic drugs are rare, but they span a growing range of serious problems, including invasive fungal infections; tuberculosis; the bacterial infections listeria and legionella; sepsis; an often-fatal viral brain infection; cancer; heart failure; and liver failure.\\nStory continues\\nWhat’s more, in rare cases the drugs may leave some patients who are using them to treat autoimmune diseases susceptible to contracting other autoimmune diseases.\\n“You have to weigh the risks and what you are looking for in your quality of life,” said Leith, 64, who lives near Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.\\nDark side effects: Biologics to treat arthritis have flooded the market. They\\'re also linked to 34,000 deaths\\nWhen he was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in 1983, doctors told him he would be in a wheelchair in five years. Thirty-six years later, he still is walking.\\n“I would not change a thing,” he said.\\nAn earlier Journal Sentinel analysis of FDA data found reports linking biologic drugs to more than 500,000 serious side effects since 2004, including more than 34,000 deaths.\\nThe analysis focused on the 19 drugs still on the market. It was limited to biologic drugs that are used to treat conditions of the skin, joints and gastrointestinal system. That is, conditions caused by faulty immune systems.\\nWhile the FDA database has limitations, including a lack of verification of the reports and the possibility that other drugs also could have been used, it is the largest publicly available data set of reactions associated with prescription drugs.\\nIf anything, experts say, it undercounts the total potentially dangerous incidents.\\n“We are learning a lot that we didn’t know at the time of approval,” said Joseph Ross, an associate professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine, who has studied drug safety. “It raises the question of should we be regulating them differently.”\\nBenefit vs. risk\\nConsider the case of Raptiva.\\nIn 2003, drugmaker Genentech submitted an upbeat report to the FDA about Raptiva, for which it was seeking approval to treat psoriasis.\\nThe company said, based on clinical trials, there were few serious side effects and no evidence of increased infections.\\n“The benefits experienced by most subjects treated with Raptiva outweigh any potential, infrequent risks,” Genentech said in its report. “Raptiva provides a significant new, safe, and efficacious alternative for patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.”\\nThe FDA gave its approval.\\nThen bad things started happening.\\nAfter reports of patients experiencing problems were submitted to the FDA and additional trials turned up new side effects, warnings for Raptiva were issued for a potentially serious red blood cell disorder; susceptibility to a flesh-eating bacteria; pneumonia; viral meningitis; and invasive fungal infections.\\nIn 2008, the FDA issued a “black box” warning on the drug for its association with life-threatening infections, including a rare, but often fatal, viral brain infection known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or PML.\\nA year later, the FDA and the company announced Raptiva was being pulled from the market because of PML brain infections in four users, including three who died.\\nThe Journal Sentinel analysis of FDA data showed 1,470 reports of serious “adverse events” linked to the drug, including 189 deaths.\\nGenentech spokeswoman Allison Neves said the decision to withdraw the drug was based on the company’s assessment of the balance between benefit and risk.\\n“It was decided that the benefit risk profile had significantly changed,” she said. “The decision was made based on our commitment to patient safety.\"\\nIt was a rare move in the world of biologic drugs.\\n‘No drug is risk-free’\\nThe FDA says it issues black-box warnings when a serious – or life-threatening – risk is detected, but the drug’s overall risk-benefit profile remains favorable.\\nOf the 19 biologics that treat conditions of the skin, joints and gastrointestinal system on the market, 12 have black box warnings.\\n“We know an enormous amount more about these products now,” said Caleb Alexander, a drug safety expert with Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\\nAlexander said there is a certain amount of subjectivity that goes into FDA decisions, including how it factors in the magnitude of risk, the level of uncertainty, the need for the drug and the number of people using it.\\n“The FDA doesn’t like to pick winners and to pick on a single product,” he said. “The FDA has quite a tolerance for risk.”\\nFew competitors: Biologic drugmakers use patents, suits to thwart generic competition\\nWhen a drug is taken off the market, he said, the decision is often made by the company based on the potential cost of lawsuits versus the lost revenue if it is no longer for sale.\\nNathan Arnold, a spokesman for the FDA, noted “new safety issues can arise at any time regardless of how long a drug has been in use or its past record of safety.”\\nArnold said there is intense scrutiny of drugs by the agency before they are approved, but acknowledged that “much work still remains to monitor approved drugs over time” and said: “No drug is risk-free, and it is not uncommon for new information to be discovered after a drug is on the market and being used by larger numbers of patients.”\\n‘The right path for us’\\nWhen Leith was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in 1983, at age 29, there were no biologic drugs for the condition on the market.\\nRheumatoid arthritis, which causes inflammation, leading to swelling, pain, stiffness and potential damage to the joints, affects more than 1 million Americans.\\nHis initial treatment involved generic drugs, including steroids and opioids, prescribed to control his pain. He was able to continue his work as a park ranger at Big Foot Beach State Park on Lake Geneva. He also worked as a part-time police officer for several departments in the area.\\nBut working became increasingly difficult.\\nThe ranger job required walking several miles a day, cutting up dead trees and sometimes doing repairs with tools.\\nIf he needed to loosen a bolt, he would use a pipe to get extra leverage. As the swelling and pain increased, he upped his use of steroids and pain drugs.\\nThe steroids made him more susceptible to tears and breaks of tendons and bones, including a broken leg in 1993, an Achilles tendon tear in 1995 and a rotator cuff tear in 2004.\\n“I muddled through it,” he said.\\nIn 1998, the FDA approved Enbrel for treating rheumatoid arthritis.\\nLeith went on the drug in the early 2000s. Going on it allowed him to be weaned off the opioids.\\nHe said Enbrel, which is given weekly by injection, helped control his symptoms. He was able to walk with less pain and he had less swelling in his joints, but after about three years it stopped working.\\nHis doctor shifted him to a different biologic, Orencia, which was given by infusion on about a monthly basis. That also worked for several years before losing its effectiveness.\\nAround this time, in 2006, Leith took early retirement and went on disability.\\nHe went on his third biologic, Rituxan, in about 2010.\\nThat helped control his arthritis until 2017 when, two days after an infusion, he was severely stricken with viral meningitis, an infection that inflames tissues that cover the brain and spinal cord.\\nHe ended up in the intensive care unit for a week. Following that, he spent 30 days at home hooked to an IV that delivered antiviral medication.\\nIn early 2018, a small tumor was found on his lung. He said doctors suspect it is cancerous and might be related to his medication. He has recently been diagnosed with nonalcoholic liver cirrhosis and is on the transplant list.\\nOver the years, he’s also had more than 20 squamous cell skin cancers removed from his hands, arms and scalp. He said doctors believe those too may be related to his use of biologics.\\nLike Raptiva, the drug Rituxan is made by Genentech. Neves, the company spokeswoman, said the company’s review of safety data shows that cirrhosis has not been identified as a side effect from Rituxan.\\nShe also noted that rheumatoid arthritis patients, in general, are at increased risk for cancers and there is no evidence that those patients who use Rituxan face an additional risk.\\nShe acknowledged that Rituxan users are at increased risk for serious viral and other infections.\\nAfter an inquiry was made about Leith’s case by a reporter, she said the information would be given to Genentech’s drug safety team, which will enter it into its safety database of reported adverse events.\\n“Every side effect they warn you about, I probably had,” Leith said.\\nThough it is impossible to predict how long an individual with rheumatoid arthritis will live, people with the disease have a life expectancy that can be 10 years shorter than normal.\\n“It think it was the right path for us,” said Leith’s wife, Kathy. “You don’t get out of here alive. We’ve had some really good times.”\\nLeith now is on a generic, non-biologic drug, mycophenolate, which also suppresses the immune system. It was developed originally to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients but sometimes is used in people with rheumatoid arthritis.\\nLeith says his arthritis is under control.\\n“If I could do it all over again I probably wouldn\\'t change anything given the information available at the time,” he said. “The biologics definitely did increase my quality of life.”\\n‘I feel like I have a normal life’\\nMany biologic drugs are approved to treat multiple conditions. And for each condition, there is a range of outcomes.\\nFor inflammatory bowel-related diseases, such as colitis and Crohn’s, remission rates are between 20% to 30% with biologic drugs, said David Rubin, a professor of medicine at the University of Chicago who also works as a consultant for several companies that market biologic drugs.\\nBetween 40% and 60% see significant improvement, said Rubin, chairman-elect of the scientific advisory committee of the Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. In some company-run clinical trials, rates of remission and significant improvement exceeded those numbers.\\nSerious side effects occur in about 1% of people under the age of 60 and 5% to 6% in those older than 60, Rubin said.\\n“People who are on these therapies recognize the benefits,” he said, noting patients should also understand the risks. “It is about education.”\\nMegan Starshak, 35, was diagnosed in 2002 with colitis, an inflammatory condition of the colon that is caused by a faulty immune system.\\nIt began to dominate her life, causing abdominal pain, fatigue and the need to go to the bathroom up to 12 times a day.\\nShe often was afraid to go out because she didn’t know if a bathroom would be nearby.\\n“I just sat in my apartment with my dog,” said Starshak, who lives in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin.\\nFor a few years, she tried to manage the condition with non-biologic drugs. In 2008, she got her first infusion of Remicade and within a few days started feeling better. Her disease has been in remission ever since.\\n“I feel like I have a normal life,” she said.\\nStarshak said she knows the risks that come with the drug.\\n“Everything has its pros and cons,” she said. “If I didn’t try it, I would have had a 100% chance of having a miserable life.”\\nA changing safety profile\\nIn 1998, Enbrel became one of the first biologics on the market when it was approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis.\\nEnbrel is known as a tumor necrosis factor (or TNF) blocker. For those without autoimmune diseases, TNF is kept in balance naturally. Like the biologics Humira and Remicade, Enbrel works by using proteins made in cells to help control inflammation.\\nSince 2004, Enbrel has been linked to reports of 135,000 serious adverse events, including 8,000 deaths, according to the Journal Sentinel analysis of FDA’s adverse events reporting system.\\nMany patients may not read or understand the full label – usually found in a folded piece of paper in the original packaging – but it provides the comprehensive list of what is known about the drug.\\nEnbrel is an example of a drug’s safety profile that has changed significantly over the years.\\nThe 1998 label says “the possibility exists” for drugs like Enbrel to affect the ability of a person to fight infections and cancers, but that the impact of Enbrel on cancers and infections “is not fully understood.”\\nThen it offered some reassuring points:\\nColds and sinus infections were the most common infections.\\nIn clinical trials of Enbrel, no increase in serious infections was found.\\nThe rates of cancers were similar to what was expected for those who were being studied.\\nThe 2018 label, which – after 21 years on the market – is the culmination of numerous updates, offers a more formidable series of warnings. Chief among them are black-box warnings for:\\n“Increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis), and infections due to other opportunistic pathogens.”\\n“Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers, including Enbrel.”\\nLooking back, the FDA-approved language on the 1998 label was too weak, said Michael Carome, a physician with the watchdog group Public Citizen.\\n“It is remarkable how much more there is now about the risks,” he said.\\nTrish Hawkins, a spokeswoman for Enbrel maker Amgen, said the drug has led to significant and often life-changing improvements for patients:\\n“While changes to a product’s safety information may occur over time as more real-world and clinical data are collected, analyzed and incorporated, Enbrel’s benefits outweigh its risks.”\\n‘I am pretty fortunate’\\nIn the early 2000s, warnings about transverse myelitis started appearing on the labels of some biologic drugs that are TNF blockers.\\nTransverse myelitis is one of several conditions that involve inflammation of nerve cells that can occur in people using biologics. The condition can cause pain, weakness and paralysis in the arms and legs. It often occurs after infections.\\nIt is estimated that 33,000 Americans have some type of disability caused by transverse myelitis, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. MS is a related and often disabling condition of the central nervous system. In rare cases, it too has been associated with use of TNF blockers, according to the information on the drug labels.\\nMore than 400 cases of various forms of myelitis in people taking biologics have been reported to the FDA since 2004, according to the Journal Sentinel analysis.\\nJeremy Bennett, 44, of Columbus, Ohio, has spent eight years on biologic drugs and now faces the effects of transverse myelitis.\\nBennett had suffered from bad psoriasis since he was a teenager, but none of the traditional drugs worked well. He also developed a related condition, psoriatic arthritis, which flared up with hip pain whenever he walked on concrete.\\nThen, at age 36, Bennett was put on Enbrel. Within a matter of months, his psoriasis cleared up.\\nHowever, in the summer after he went on the drug he started feeling numbness in his fingertips. Tests were done, but no cause could be found. The numbness went away but came back a few months later.\\nThen, one night he woke up and his entire right arm was numb.\\n“I tried shaking it out, but it wasn’t going away,” he said.\\nA battery of tests and scans were done, including an MRI.\\n“The doctor calls and says, ‘We’ve got something here,’ ” Bennett recalled.\\nHe was diagnosed with transverse myelitis. By then, the condition had gotten extremely painful and had spread to his neck. For a time, the numbness spread to his right leg, which forced him to walk with a cane.\\nBennett said his doctors surmised that Enbrel may have played a role in the condition and he was immediately taken off the drug. It is not known whether Enbrel caused the transverse myelitis or was some sort of catalyst.\\nRegardless, he never went back on Enbrel, which caused his psoriasis to return.\\nHe now is using the biologic Cosentyx, which works differently than Enbrel. He said he knows there are risks with Cosentyx – “I was scared at first” – but unlike Enbrel, it does not carry a black-box warning.\\nBennett said Cosentyx is about 90% as effective as Enbrel in controlling his psoriasis and a related form of arthritis.\\nBennett, who now works for the Transverse Myelitis Association, said he has some permanent nerve pain in his arm, but he is able to use it.\\n“I am pretty fortunate compared to some people I know,” he said. “I know people who are paralyzed.”\\nFollow John Fauber on Twitter: @Fauber_MJS\\nAbout this project\\nThis story — and others in this series — was produced with the support of the National Institute for Health Care Management Foundation.

       " 'Stay tuned in to our local news coverage: Listen to 90.7 WMFE on your FM or HD radio, the WMFE mobile app or your smart speaker — say “Alexa, play NPR” and you’ll be connected.\\nSome cities, counties and school districts in Florida and around the country are helping their employees buy cheap prescription drugs from Canada and overseas.\\nHealth News Florida’s Julio Ochoa sat down with Phil Galewitz from Kaiser Health News to talk about his reporting on the issue.\\nOchoa: Phil we’ve been following your reporting on cities, counties and school districts that are helping their employees get cheap medications from pharmacies in Canada and overseas. Can you tell us how that works?\\nGalewitz: Sure. Well obviously drug costs are a big issue for cities and counties and school districts, as they are for everybody these days. And over the last number of years a number of municipalities, such as Flagler County Florida; Kokomo, Indiana; Schenectady County, New York have contracted with middlemen to help them buy drugs from Canada and overseas. A lot of Americans have been doing this over the Internet for many years. A number of local governments who are struggling with drug prices have tried to do the same thing, where they’re buying drugs either from pharmacies in Canada or pharmacies in other countries like England or Australia.\\nDrugs are less expensive overseas because for one, generics are more prevalent over there. Expensive drugs become generic more quickly overseas than they do in the United States typically. And also governments tell pharmaceutical companies what they’re going to pay for the drugs, unlike in the United States where pharmaceutical companies tell the government what they’re going to charge for the drugs. So drugs are much cheaper in Canada and overseas.\\nAnd so these local governments are contracting with these middlemen companies to help their employees purchase medications. These are chronic medications, these are not drugs you take for the flu or when you need a drug tomorrow. These can be asthma drugs, these can be diabetes drugs. They can purchase these drugs from overseas through these middlemen and they can save 60, 70, 80 percent of the cost of these drugs. And in many cases, the savings are so big to the local governments that the governments make it so the drugs are free. In other words, the government is saving so much on the price off of these drugs that the individual or the employee can get the drugs for free.\\nOchoa: You reported on a few counties and school districts that did this. How widespread is it?\\nGalewitz: It’s fair to say dozens of counties. It’s really unclear. Nobody has done a full, complete count. But as part of our research at Kaiser Health News on this we found dozens of counties basically through searching the internet where counties, cities and school districts were putting out memos telling their employees about this new benefit. And so we ran across these different memos online. And then we contacted various associations who follow this and then we’ve contacted a couple of these middlemen companies that helped the government set up these arrangements.\\nIt’s really big in New York State. It’s really big in the Northeast. We must have found at least 25 or 30 counties in New York that do it. Obviously there were several counties in Florida that are there doing it. So it’s just growing. I mean as one county finds the savings and we haven’t heard of any problems. And so as each county has had something good to say that’s attracting more counties, more school districts to try the same thing.\\nOchoa: Is it illegal to get prescription medications from other countries?\\nYes. The FDA says it’s illegal to bring in drugs from overseas in almost all cases. The only cases they say where technically it’s legal is if the drug is not sold in the United States. But 99.9 percent of the drugs people want in the United States are drugs already sold here. So yes, the FDA says its illegal but for the last couple of decades the FDA has allowed people to buy drugs for personal use from overseas. As one FDA official told me, we’re not going out to prosecute grandma. I don’t think they want that policy.\\nTo be clear though, the FDA has gone after many Internet pharmacies that try to sell drugs overseas. And they’ve gone after the supplier in some of these cases, these Internet pharmacies. But the FDA to my knowledge has never gone after a person attempting or having bought drugs from overseas.\\nEvery now and then you do hear about some drugs that are confiscated at post offices in the United States and that may slow down people getting their drugs.\\nOchoa: Why does the FDA say people shouldn’t be allowed to get cheap prescriptions from foreign countries?\\nGalewitz: They say that the FDA can control the supply of medications in the United States from the manufacturer, to the wholesaler, to the retailer. The FDA says it has much more oversight where they can ensure the safety of those medications here as opposed to when they’re coming from pharmacies overseas. Critics of this policy, of course, would point out that many of the drugs sold in the United States are not made in the United States. That many drugs that are sold at your local CVS or your local Walgreens are made in Ireland or made in countries outside the U.S.\\nOchoa: Do these municipalities do anything to protect their employees?\\nGalewitz: I think they’ve done their due diligence. They’ve worked with these middleman companies which assured them that the pharmacies that they deal with in Canada in England are true, reputable pharmacies. These are pharmacies that often are selling to people in their countries and these pharmacies have a track record of supplying accurate drugs and safe drugs to consumers. In other words, they’re not just buying from anybody. They’ve done some due diligence and there are some associations that help give sort of a “Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval” to some of these pharmacies outside the United States. And those are the ones they will try to work with.\\nOchoa: You’ve also reported on storefronts that help people do the same thing but the Food and Drug Administration has cracked down on them. Tell us about that.\\nGalewitz: There have been these storefronts that have existed in Florida for almost 15 years now. They started up about 2002, 2003, particularly serving seniors who are seeing huge prices for drugs. Many seniors at that point and even today were leery of going on the Internet and buying drugs from someone who they couldn’t see. So some of the storefronts set it up where they would serve as a middleman. The seniors would go in and sit with somebody who would go over what drugs they needed. They sit in front of a computer terminal and they show them what price they could get at pharmacies around the world, or particularly in Canada. And so the store fronts became very popular in Florida, particularly in retiree areas such as South Florida and the Tampa Bay area and central Florida.\\nThese stores are not pharmacies. They don’t have the drugs themselves. They’re just a middleman connecting the consumer to these pharmacies in Canada, New Zealand, Australia or England or other places around the world. Then these people have the drugs mailed right to their house. So they’ve existed for a number of years right out in the open, right out on Main Street. They’re not hiding themselves. They’re advertising in the local newspapers. So nothing was ever hidden from anybody.\\nBut last fall one of these storefronts called Canadian Med Store was raided by FDA agents who were saying what they were doing was illegal. They came in and collected their computers and their paperwork. They didn’t shut them down. But they certainly put a scare into these stores to raise questions of what they were doing. And so one of the owners of these stores raised the question about why they were being raided.\\nThe search warrants and the affidavits that we went over showed that the FDA agents had gone in undercover to buy drugs from these store fronts and to see what they were getting. They wanted to make sure if someone was ordering an asthma drug, they were really getting that asthma drug at the dosage they thought. And in the court documents it showed that there was no problem. When they were ordering the drugs, they were getting the drugs. So that gave the storefronts a sign that they thought what they were doing was OK. So the FDA sort of left it open. They’re saying you can’t do this, this is illegal. But to date, they have not shut them down.\\nOchoa: The FDA hasn’t done similar raids on these benefit programs at school districts and municipalities. Do they have a different policy for them?\\nGalewitz: They’ve let these things go on. You can look at their policy based on their actions. Some of these counties and cities have been doing this for a decade or more. This isn’t new. I mean, they were doing this under the George Bush administration. They were doing it under the Obama administration. Now they’re doing it under the Trump administration and the FDA has let these things go on. It seems to me, if the FDA wanted to step in and do something, they’ve had many, many years to do it and they’ve chosen not to.\\nAnd that’s why I think it has given a green light to more and more local governments to do this. But it’s also raised the question of how they could let cities, counties and municipalities help their employees buy drugs from overseas but at the same time, not a middleman who wants to help an individual in a city do the same thing. It might be seen by some to be hypocritical. Why would they let one happen and not the other?\\nWUSF is a partner with Health News Florida, a statewide collaborative reporting on health care.\\nHealth reporting on WMFE is supported in part by AdventHealth.',\n",

       " 'news, court-and-crime,\\nA drug addict with nowhere to live left court distressed and screaming this week when she was refused bail. Sydney King,33, is facing drug and driving charges after she was arrested at Everton Upper last month allegedly with 1,4 Butanediol, 6.2 grams of methamphetamine, 0.2g of heroin, cannabis seeds and six xanax tablets. She was released on bail on her second attempt in July, but arrested again this week for breaching that bail by not living at her designated address. King told Wangaratta Magistrates Court she could not stay there anymore because of inappropriate behaviour by the occupant. Senior Constable Brett Angel gave evidence the woman was “heavily substance affected at the time” when she was arrested on August 11. “She was irrational, she was crying,” he said. “She was extremely emotional, which is consistent with Ms King using drugs.” He said she had previous called the 1,4 Butanediol, which turns into GHB when ingested, her “happiness in a bottle”. Speaking from the court dock, where she sat in handcuffs, King denied using drugs while on bail and said she had been crying because she was traumatised. “I’ve been off shard (methamphetamine) that whole time … I’ve sold both my cars so I’m no longer a risk of driving. Why are you so against me?” King said. “I want to succeed at this and I’ve not been afforded a proper chance because I’m on remand.” King represented herself because one lawyer removed herself from the case and another available in Wangaratta that day was already representing her co-accused in the drugs case. She starting crying and begging magistrate Fran Medina to release her on bail so she could ensure her dog was looked after properly. Bail was refused because King had no place to stay and had not provided the required “compelling reasons” why she should be released after already breaching bail. The case was adjourned until October.\\n/images/transform/v1/crop/frm/CXnecSe9En4WWrpX4sC8Fx/48195898-11dc-47e2-9e0d-7bdc88bea225.jpg/r4_0_1597_900_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg',\n",

They were produced in court and remanded in police custody till October 7, after which we started interrogating them for more information about their racket,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (ANC) Shivdeep Lande said.\\nHe said the accused have confessed that they were going to smuggle the drugs to Qatar by concealing various quantities in the luggage of people flying from India.\\n“The accused would seek out people who were going on holiday to Qatar or those looking for jobs in the country, and offer to fund their travel and stay. In exchange, they would ask the people to carry some luggage for them and hand it over to their relatives at the Qatar airport. We suspect that the people did not even know that they were ferrying cannabis,” Mr. Lande said.\\nAccording to inquiries so far, the duo would employ various methods to conceal the drugs, like hiding it in the handles of trolley bags or in the heels of shoes. The police said they would fly the mules out of airports in Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Kochi and Mangaluru.\\n“We are getting details of fliers arrested at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport and checking if any of them were carrying the drugs for the accused. They are both natives of Kerala and mainly operate in south India,” Mr. Lande said.\\nThe duo has been charged under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and the police are conducting further inquiries against them.',\n",

       " 'Former FDA leaders decry emergency authorization of malaria drugs for coronavirus\\nScience ’s COVID-19 reporting is supported by the Pulitzer Center.\\nThe recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization (EUA) for two malaria drugs to treat COVID-19, based on thin evidence of efficacy, has jeopardized research to learn the drugs’ real value against the pandemic coronavirus, say former agency executives under President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama. They also charge that the 28 March EUA for chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate undermines FDA’s scientific authority because it appeared to be a response not to scientific evidence, but to fervent advocacy of the drugs by Trump and other political figures.\\nFDA has multiple mechanisms to allow the use of unapproved, experimental drugs for small numbers of desperately ill patients outside of clinical trials. Because chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are approved for malaria, doctors could prescribe them “off label” for COVID-19 patients even without the EUA. Since Trump first endorsed the drugs on 19 March, however, shortages have been reported, depriving some people with autoimmune disorders such as lupus who also depend on hydroxychloroquine. The EUA will immediately add tens of millions of doses of the drugs for distribution to hospitalized COVID-19 patients through health care centers.\\nTrump has suggested the EUA was needed because effective clinical trials of the drugs would take too long during the global crisis. At a 5 April news conference, he said: “We don’t have time to go and say, ‘Gee, let’s take a couple of years and test it out, and let’s go and test with the test tubes and the laboratories.’”\\n“I’d love to do that, but we have people dying today,” he added.\\nScott Gottlieb, FDA commissioner under Trump until last year, has consistently called for more research on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine, with or without the antibiotic azithromycin. “If the drug combo is working its effect is probably subtle enough that only rigorous and large-scale trials will tease it out,” he tweeted on 5 April.\\nMargaret Hamburg, FDA commissioner during most of Obama’s tenure, including the H1N1, Zika, and Ebola crises, says she was “surprised and perturbed” by the EUA. “I understand the desire to find hope, but we need more evidence than is currently available before we encourage widespread use,” says Hamburg, who is a past president of AAAS, which publishes Science Insider. Valuable clinical trial evidence on the two malaria drugs could be gathered in a few weeks, Hamburg adds—but the EUA could make that more difficult. “Making the drugs available in a more widespread way might actually interfere with the ability to get the data that we need.”\\nSince 2005, FDA has issued EUAs more than 100 times, mostly for diagnostic tests to detect emerging pathogens, including 34 such authorizations for tests for the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. (Here’s a table of all EUAs.) The recent authorizations for the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, based on what FDA cited as “limited in-vitro and anecdotal clinical data in case series,” and Chinese and South Korean COVID-19 treatment guidelines, fell below earlier standards for therapeutic EUAs, Hamburg and others say. In contrast, the European Medicines Agency called for use of the drugs only in clinical trials or for emergency use as defined by each nation’s policies.\\nThe only comparable EUAs—an antibiotic to treat anthrax in 2011 and antiviral drugs to treat the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in 2009—enjoyed far stronger evidence of safety and efficacy, former FDA officials say. Even then, one of the drugs authorized for use on H1N1 turned out to be ineffective.\\nEUAs might prove crucial in the new pandemic, but only if credible, says Luciana Borio, a former FDA acting chief scientist who directed medical and biodefense preparedness for Trump’s National Security Council. “You want the EUA to be seen by the public as a step the government is taking to facilitate access to a product that they truly believe has benefits that outweigh the risks. Not, ‘We’re not sure,’” says Borio, who was part of a team set up under Obama to coordinate actions to fight pandemics that was eliminated by the Trump administration during a 2018 reorganization.\\nMaking the drugs available in a more widespread way might actually interfere with the ability to get the data that we need. Margaret Hamburg, former FDA commissioner\\nAlthough the World Health Organization last month deemed the two malaria drugs worthy of being tested in rapidly organized global COVID-19 treatment trials, the push to use hydroxychloroquine—it’s considered a relatively safe form of chloroquine—on a mass scale in the United States came after a tweet from Trump. On 21 March, he said that when taken with azithromycin, the drug has “a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.” Trump cited a small French trial of 42 COVID-19 patients that has been criticized for lapses widely viewed as rendering its findings unreliable. Even the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, publisher of the peer-reviewed journal that released the study, recently said it “does not meet the Society’s expected standard.”\\nFDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn initially tried to temper the president’s enthusiasm, calling for clinical trials as a first step at a 19 March news conference. Nine days later, with those trials ramping up, the EUA authorized health care centers to draw on the Strategic National Stockpile’s massive supply of the drugs for “treatment of COVID-19 when clinical trials are not available, or participation is not feasible.” FDA said that in the absence of approved or available alternatives for treating COVID-19, the drugs’ “known and potential benefits … outweigh the known and potential risks.”\\nFDA Chief Scientist Denise Hinton, who signed the EAU, did not respond to a request for comment. An FDA spokesperson wrote in an email that the EUA was not a response to Trump’s prodding. Instead, the spokesperson said, it was prepared by career staff who consulted with the relevant federal agencies, and was based on “studies in countries including China, Korea, and France.” Two small Chinese trials, which many infectious disease researchers and clinicians regard as more scientifically sound than the French study Trump tweeted about, reached opposite conclusions. In one, COVID-19 patients taking hydroxychloroquine had better outcomes, and in the other, those who received a placebo improved more. A second small French trial found hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin ineffective for severely ill COVID-19 patients.\\nBorio, now a vice president at In-Q-Tel, a national security–oriented venture capital firm, adds that FDA, in issuing the EUA, also overlooked the drugs’ record against other viruses. She cites a “long history of having tried hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for emerging viral infections, and seeing it fail to help patients despite some activity in vitro and even in animal models.”\\nImpeding clinical trials\\nDavid Boulware, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, working on COVID-19 trials, suggests the EUA may impede testing of another potential COVID-19 treatment. He says colleagues working on a randomized, placebo-controlled, multisite trial of remdesivir, Gilead Sciences’s experimental antiviral drug, have encountered hospitalized COVID-19 patients who ask, “Do I want to get a placebo? I’m really sick and I can get hydroxychloroquine.” Some are opting out of the remdesivir study, Boulware says.\\nPeople say that the time to do these studies is not during a public health emergency—it’s too hard. Actually, that’s the best time, because with a crisis unfolding you have the greatest opportunity to learn about these products the quickest way, because of rapid enrollment. Luciana Borio, former FDA acting chief scientist\\nPurposely or not, and despite skepticism from many doctors, FDA might have made hydroxychloroquine the de facto standard of care for COVID-19, he and others suggest. That could also undermine the COVID-19 trials of it and chloroquine. It’s too soon to know what the impact might be, researchers organizing those trials told Science Insider. But Peter Lurie, a physician and FDA executive under Obama and Trump who now heads the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group, says the EUA weakens the incentive to sign up for a trial. “Why take a 50% chance of getting a placebo when you can be guaranteed to get a drug you’re hoping to get? Then you’re left in a situation where a drug is widely used and evidence of its effectiveness for this indication is never generated.”\\nWith so many people dying from COVID-19, calling for more data before widespread use of the malaria drugs can be “a hard message,” Hamburg concedes. “People want to have a treatment available to them and their loved ones. But until [it’s] examined with some rigor, we won’t know whether this will work now, and it’s also making it hard to get answers for patients tomorrow and the future.”\\nBorio adds that proper trials need not take long. “People say that the time to do these studies is not during a public health emergency—it’s too hard. Actually, that’s the best time, because with a crisis unfolding you have the greatest opportunity to learn about these products the quickest way, because of rapid enrollment,” she says. “If it’s a blockbuster, we would know so quickly.”\\nFDA declined to comment specifically about trial enrollment concerns but said it is working with other federal agencies to plan clinical trials of the two drugs.\\nRisks rise when millions use a drug\\nSome FDA observers defend the agency by pointing out it has occasionally given full commercial approval to drugs based on relatively scant evidence, including a controversial treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy last year. Erika Lietzan of the University of Missouri School of Law, who studies food and drug regulation, cited Ceprotin—a biologic to treat patients with a genetically linked, life-threatening blood clotting problem—approved by FDA in 2007 based on a nonrandomized trial of only 18 subjects.\\nBut the rare diseases addressed by those FDA actions affect few people compared with COVID-19. When FDA endorses a drug with known, life-threatening side effects for use by millions of hospitalized people to treat a poorly understood condition, the potential for harm rises exponentially, Lurie and others warn.\\n“What is quite certain: When you get large numbers of people exposed to [hydroxychloroquine], there will be important adverse effects,” including sometimes-lethal cardiac toxicity, Lurie says. “That can be acceptable in the setting of known benefits, but it’s more difficult to accept when there isn’t now and might never be evidence of benefit.”\\n“The idea that we have nothing to lose by trying anything with the smallest glimmer of hope is terribly misguided,” adds Patricia Zettler, a law professor at Ohio State University, Columbus, and former FDA associate chief counsel under Obama. “As a society, we risk losing the opportunity to understand what actually works, and what doesn’t.”\\nAnother safety concern emerged on 20 March, when FDA lifted its import restrictions on Ipca Laboratories, a leading Indian maker of the drugs. FDA has repeatedly cited the company for manufacturing lapses, most recently in a scathing inspection report in August 2019. The agency told Science Insider the reprieve was only for the malaria drugs, to meet surging U.S. demand. It said the firm “agreed to perform additional quality mitigation steps” for the drugs.\\n“Ipca had data integrity issues and cascading failures in quality control,” says Hamburg, who led FDA when the firm was cited for such problems in 2014. “That signals to me that it’s probably not a drug we want from that supplier.”\\nDangerous precedent?\\nFDA watchers also wonder how the agency will respond to the next remedy supported by anecdotal reports when facing public fears about a growing death toll and presidential pressure. There is no shortage of candidates—including zinc, remdesivir, the Japanese flu drug favipiravir (branded as Avigan), and a stem cell product touted by Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani. FDA said that by law, it “generally cannot confirm, deny, or comment” about such prospects, and “will not speculate” on future EUAs; it has, however, already approved the testing of the stem cell product in a clinical trial of COVID-19 patients.\\n“When the evidence base for granting the EUA is as flimsy as this, the question becomes, ‘Whose EUA will not be granted, especially in the context of an epidemic?’” Lurie says. “What happens when the epidemic is not [historically] bad, when it’s just a bad season of the flu?”\\nAnd Hamburg says she fears that with its EUA, FDA has taken “a step away from scientific rigor, to a system that is much more subject to all kinds of interference, from wishful thinking to frank political and economic motivations.”',\n",

       " 'Concern over asthma drugs Millions of asthma patients have started using long-acting drugs to help them breathe more normally, allowing for nights of uninterrupted sleep or workouts at the gym.\\nIn recent years, millions of asthma patients have started using long-acting drugs to help them breathe more normally, allowing for nights of uninterrupted sleep or workouts at the gym.\\nNow the Food and Drug Administration is investigating whether the medications, in rare cases, can increase the risk of serious asthma complications, the kinds that send patients to the emergency room gasping for air.\\nAt a two-day meeting, independent medical advisers will hear the scientific evidence and make recommendations on whether the drugs should continue to be used to treat asthma. At issue are four inhaler medications: Advair, Foradil, Serevent and Symbicord.\\nWithin the FDA, opinions appear to be divided. The safety office is recommending that Foradil and Serevent no longer be used for asthma, and that none of the drugs be used by children 17 and under. But the head of the FDA office that oversees respiratory medications has written that banning the drugs would be \"an extreme approach,\" and could backfire by leading to more cases of uncontrolled asthma.\\nDocs worried drugs could be banned\\nThe companies that make the medications say they are safe, and that at least some of the medical evidence that has raised questions from the FDA is of poor quality. Doctors who treat asthma patients are worried that the drugs could be banned.\\nThe four drugs contain a kind of long-acting medication known as a LABA. The drug relaxes tight muscles around narrowed airways. Medical guidelines for treating moderate to severe asthma recommend use of a Laba together with a steroid, which treats inflammation deep inside the airways.\\nForadil and Serevent are Laba-only products. Advair and Symbicord combine a Laba and a steroid in one inhaler that patients use every 12 hours. Asthma patients must also carry a \"rescue\" inhaler to deal with the sudden onset of symptoms.\\nSome experts believe that using a Laba drug alone can mask developing symptoms, and unexpectedly get patients in trouble. That\\'s why medical guidelines call for Laba medications to be used along with a steroid.\\nHow the study was done\\nThe FDA analysed findings from 110 clinical trials involving nearly 61 000 patients, comparing patients who took a medication containing a Laba with those who used a steroid alone to control their asthma. Experts looked for deaths, hospitalisations and cases in which a patient had to have a breathing tube inserted.\\nThe analysis found 20 deaths from asthma complications, of which 16 were in patients taking a LABA-only drug, Serevent.\\nAdvair, a widely used medication made by GlaxoSmithKline, did not appear to have a higher rate of serious complications when compared with treatment on steroids only. Foradil, Serevent and Symbicord all had higher rates of problems, but the increase was statistically significant only in the case of Serevent.\\nThere has been a significant increase in the number of people who have asthma amongst all races in South Africa. Over the past 25 years a 25 to 200 times rise in hospital admissions for asthma have been recorded in hospitals in Durban and Soweto.– (Sapa/Health24, December 2008)',\n",

While some strains secrete enzymes that thwart antibiotics, others do not.\\nA broad-spectrum antibiotic can kill off more of the vulnerable, less dangerous bacteria, leaving the more dangerous and robust bacteria to propagate.\\nOften, superbugs have made their way into hospitals in someones intestines, where they had evolved high resistance through years of occasional treatment with antibiotics for small infections.\\nThen those bacteria have infected patients with weak immune systems.\\nFurious infections have ensued, essentially invulnerable to antibiotics, followed by sepsis and death.\\nDrug developers facing dwindling antibiotic effectiveness against evolved bacteria have looked for multiple alternate treatments.\\nThe focus has often been to find some new class of drug that works as well as or better than antibiotics, but so far, nothing has, Brown said.\\nThe researchers proposed a different approach. Developing non-antibiotic therapies for strep throat, bladder infections, and bronchitis could prove easier, thus encouraging pharmaceutical investment and research.\\nIf doctors had enough alternatives to antibiotics for the multitude of small infections they treat, they could help preserve antibiotic effectiveness longer for the far less common but much more deadly infections, for which they are most needed.

       " 'ICC looking at complaint about war on drugs\\nBy Karen Lema and Neil Jerome Morales\\nMANILA, March 14 (Reuters) - The Philippines said on Wednesday it is withdrawing from the International Criminal Court (ICC) due to what President Rodrigo Duterte called \"outrageous\" attacks by U.N. officials and violations of due process by the ICC.\\nThe decision marks a stunning about-face by Duterte, who has repeatedly dared the ICC to indict him and said he was willing to \"rot in jail\" or go on trial to defend a war on drugs that has killed thousands of his own people.\\nThe mercurial former mayor had initially welcomed last month\\'s announcement by the ICC of its preliminary examination into a complaint filed by a Philippine lawyer accusing Duterte and top officials of crimes against humanity.\\nBut in a 15-page statement, dated March 13, Duterte said he was withdrawing from the ICC\\'s founding treaty, the Rome Statute, because of \"baseless, unprecedented and outrageous attacks\" by U.N. officials, and ICC actions that he said failed to follow due process and presumption of innocence.\\n\"There appears to be a concerted effort on the part of the U.N. special rapporteurs to paint me as a ruthless and heartless violator of human rights who allegedly caused thousands of extrajudicial killings,\" Duterte said.\\nThe ICC\\'s examination was premature, he added, and \"effectively created the impression that I am to be charged ... for serious crimes falling under its jurisdiction.\"\\nHe made no mention of the withdrawal in a speech on Wednesday.\\nDuterte\\'s chief critics said the move was a U-turn that showed the tough-talking leader was now in panic mode.\\n\"This is an embarrassing attempt to create legal cover, and a self-serving effort to avoid accountability and place himself above Philippine and international law,\" said Sam Zarifi, Secretary General of the International Commission of Jurists.\\nThe London-based rights group Amnesty International called the withdrawal \"misguided\" and \"cowardly\".\\nHuman Rights Watch called it \"a barefaced attempt to shield him and high-ranking officials\", noting that withdrawal took a year and the ICC could still prosecute international crimes committed while the Philippines was a member.\\nAn ICC spokesman referred most questions to the court\\'s prosecutors, who could not immediately be reached.\\nINTERNATIONAL ALARM\\nDuterte\\'s bloody campaign has caused international alarm and fierce criticism from some U.N. representatives, including High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra\\'ad al-Hussein, who on Friday said Duterte should submit himself for a psychiatric examination.\\nDuterte\\'s defiance is among the traits that make him wildly popular in the Philippines, where his crackdown has broad support. He has refused to accept some police may be systematically executing suspected dealers, as activists say.\\nPolice deny allegations of murder and cover-ups and say they killed about 4,100 drug dealers in shootouts, but have nothing to do with an estimated 2,300 largely unsolved drug-related homicides.\\nLast month, he indicated he would cooperate with the ICC examination and even said he would prefer a firing squad to prison.\\nBut he soon changed his tune, telling security forces not to cooperate in any international investigation, and that \"not in a million years\" would the ICC have jurisdiction.\\nJude Sabio, the lawyer who filed the ICC complaint last year, said Duterte\\'s move was predictable, futile and designed to appeal to his support base.\\n\"Looks like they are really afraid. Why? They feel that this will proceed to an investigation,\" Sabio told Reuters, adding the withdrawal \"will have no binding legal effect\".\\nThe ICC can only intervene when a member state is unable or unwilling to carry out investigations and prosecute suspected perpetrators. The Philippines says that is far from the case.\\nThe ICC\\'s examination seeks to establish whether crimes have taken place, and such a process typically takes years.\\nDuterte\\'s spokesman, Harry Roque, said the ICC was \"siding with the enemies of the president\", while Duterte\\'s legal counsel Salvador Panelo said the accession to the Rome Statute in 2011 was never announced in the Philippines official gazette, thus did not apply.\\nPanelo insisted Duterte was not afraid, but objected to the ICC becoming \"a political tool to harass a particular country, like ours\".\\nDuterte\\'s critics argued otherwise. Senator Risa Hontiveros said Duterte was desperate and \"may have unwittingly displayed his fear of being proven guilty\".\\nSenator Antonio Trillanes said Duterte was withdrawing \"because he knows that there is no way out for him in the ICC\".

       " \"Africa is expected to record a surge in illicit drug users between 2019 and 2050, a report has indicated. Currently, drug prevalence levels are higher in Sub-Saharan Africa than in Latin America and the Caribbean or South Asia, though not as high as in Europe and Central Asia. In the next 30 years, there will be an additional 14 million of such users in Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa will have about 23 million users.\\nSEE ALSO: Uhuru says infections 'manageable' as 213 new cases reported\\nThe findings were made in a study by ENACT, a transnational organised-crime programme that analysed Africa’s drug trade, policy and future consumption trends. The drug scourge is blamed on weak regulation and organised crime across national borders. Of the five African regions, East Africa is projected to have the sharpest increase in proportion to its population that is abusing drugs. “In comparison, drug use is projected to increase by approximately one-fifth in Central and North Africa, while in southern Africa, it is expected to remain relatively stable, at approximately 1.3 per cent of the population,” reads the report.The study notes that East Africa’s increase of drug users will be due to its rapid urbanisation and bulging youth population who are the drivers of drug consumption and abuse.\\nSEE ALSO: Haji goes after Maasai Mara VC, 4 others in Sh177m fraud\\nThe report indicates that the youth, which is linked to a higher probability of social instability and violence, is having a growth in disposable income. “Economic forces are also likely to drive a more rapid increase in the prevalence rate in East Africa than in other regions,” the report states. “Household consumption, for instance, is projected to more than triple in Central and West Africa by 2050 but to increase more than five times in East Africa”. The consumption rate will become a public health emergency since the continent will not meet the demand for treatment. West Africa is set to remain the continent’s largest regional drug market. It will double from about 5.7 million users in 2018 to approximately 13 million in 2050. ENACT says West Africa’s role has also expanded as a global drug-trafficking hub, particularly for cocaine.\\nSEE ALSO: No, medics didn’t almost accidentally bury a Covid-19 patient alive\\nA growing heroin economy has emerged from the international drug smuggling route down the East Coast of Africa for shipment to international markets.\\n“An underground economy has developed around the production and distribution of methamphetamines, particularly in Nigeria”.The markets are becoming more sophisticated as perpetrators take advantage of secure innovations such as blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies and trading platforms on the dark web. ENACT programme head Eric Pelser has implored the African Union and the regional economic communities to address the challenge. “Illegal drug use poses a formidable law enforcement and public health problem to governments in Africa,’ he said. ENACT is a European Union-funded partnership between the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), Interpol and the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime (GI). ENACT has called on governments to ensure effective systems that reduce production and trafficking of drugs even as they expand healthcare for treatment of drug users “Data collection and monitoring of drug use should be expanded and coordinated, and the stigma removed from drug use and the need for treatment. All regions of the continent should bolster their intelligence-led cross-border law enforcement to curb supply and production of illicit drugs, targeting traffickers rather than users,” it said.\",\n",

       " '1. Moving away from the usual banal political repertoire let us concentrate on other things, for a change!!! I read a refreshingly different article in the Ceylon Daily News of 27th March ‘HONOUR AMONG THE CORRUPT’ but the blurb is what caught my attention - it says, and I quote:\\n“IT IS NO SECRET THAT COUNTRIES THAT HAVE GROWN SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY ARE THOSE THAT HAVE COMBATTED CORRUPTION. THEY FOLLOW A METHOD OF EXPOSING THOSE CORRUPT AND MAINLY BY INCULCATING IN THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF THE PEOPLE THAT BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION ARE WRONG. ONLY ONCE WE LEARN TO ACCEPT THIS AND ACT WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RID THIS COUNTRY OF CORRUPTION.”\\nINCULCATIONIN HEARTSAND MINDS\\n1a. Who, in this country is inculcating in the hearts and minds of the people that bribery and corruption are WRONG??? More than that, are the children being TAUGHT, SCHOOLED TILL IT PENETRATES THEIR MINDS THAT BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION ARE WRONG??? WHAT IS HAPPENING INSTEAD??? DRUGS ARE AVAILABLE IN SCHOOL, IN VARIOUS FORMS, SWEETS, CHEWING GUM, YOU NAME IT AND THE KIDS HAVE IT!!! TEACHERS CONVENIENTLY TURN A BLIND EYE!!! WE ARE CONSTRAINED TO ASK, WHAT IS IN IT FOR THE TEACHERS??? IF OUR KIDS ARE NOT BROUGHT UP CORRECTLY, NOT GIVEN THE CORRECT PERSPECTIVES ON LIFE, NOT TAUGHT PRECISELY WHAT IS RIGHT AND WRONG AND MADE TO STAND UP FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN; WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE INCULCATING IN THEM???\\n1b. Have we even evolved any method of inculcating in all Sri Lankans and particularly the young generation that bribery and corruption are wrong? All we conveniently do is turn a blind eye!!! When a Policeman stops someone for a traffic offence, some money is stealthily slipped into the licence and then handed over. Problem solved!!! If an accident occurs and you belong to the kind that does not want to go to court, money changes hands and all is well!!! Hospital queues, any queues are no problem, nothing in this country of ours is insurmountable!!! Tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, water problems, any problem, you name it and it will be overcome!!! We specialize in capitalizing on the agony and misery of others; even though they are our own countrymen; sometimes, even our own flesh and Blood!!! IT IS ALWAYS ‘ME’ ‘I’ NEVER ‘WE’ ‘YOU’ ‘US!!!’ MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SENT FOR TSUNAMI RELIEF FOUND ITS WAY TO THE POCKETS OF BIGWIGS!!! APART FROM MONEY WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE FOOD RELIEF ITEMS THAT CAME IN??? WHOSE HOUSES AND POCKETS WERE FILLED!!!\\nIf there is ever a national disaster in the country, whether it is of epic proportions or not, there are hordes of human vultures waiting to capitalize on the situation with no qualms whatsoever.\\nTYPICAL EXAMPLE OF MAN’S INHUMANITY TO MAN!!! HOW THEN ARE WE SUPPOSED TO COMBAT BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION??? HOW CAN WE TEACH OUR CHILDREN, WHAT WE DON’T PRACTICE OURSELVES??? THE ALL IMPORTANT QUESTION BEING “IS THERE HOPE FOR OUR CHILDREN???” WE FEAR NOT!!!\\nSMARTPHONE SAND DRUGSIN SCHOOLS\\n2. SMARTPHONES AND DRUGS IN SCHOOLS ARE THE BIGGEST CURSE IN OUR COUNTRY TODAY!!! TEACHERS SEEM TO BE OBLIVIOUS TO THE EVILS OF SMARTPHONES AND DRUGS. KIDS DO NOT CONCENTRATE ON THEIR STUDIES BECAUSE THEY HAVE CONTINUOUS INCOMING MESSAGES, WHAT’S APP, INTERNET, FACEBOOK, ETC. SOCIAL MEDIA WHICH DISRUPTS THE ENTIRE SYSTEM OF EDUCATION AND THE TEACHERS COULD NOT BE HAPPIER BECAUSE IT MEANS ‘TUITION’ THAT PARENTS DREAD AND TEACHERS WELCOME!!! THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION MUST BAN SMARTPHONES IN ALL SCHOOLS AND ALLOW ONLY A PHONE ON WHICH A CALL COULD BE TAKEN IN AN EMERGENCY, FOR THE WELL BEING OF OUR CHILDREN, IT IS SOMETHING THAT MUST HAPPEN.\\n2a. DRUGS IN SCHOOL\\nThis is the other menace that has penetrated our schools, especially the big schools. There is a drug called ‘apple’ which apparently is the most popular sold as a sweet. Sadly, most parents are not even aware of this. Drugs are sold surreptitiously both inside the school and outside, mostly at interval times.\\nOne way of curbing this menace is for parents to stop giving their children so much pocket money. Combine the phones with calls, games and other distractions; add drugs to that and you have a DANGEROUS POTPOURRI THAT THE KIDS OF TODAY PLAY WITH!!! MOST TIMES, IT IS BECAUSE THE PARENTS DON’T CARE AND CANNOT BE BOTHERED!!! AS LONG AS THE CHILDREN DON’T DISTURB THEM, EVERYTHING IS FINE!!! THAT IS WHY PARENTS DON’T KNOW, BECAUSE, THEY DON’T CARE!!\\n2b. Why can’t the CID be brought in to curb this menace??? Not every day but raid different schools at different times, come down hard on the perpetrators and perhaps there may still be some hope for our children!!!\\nANY PROGRESS SEEN??\\n3. FINALLY, UDAYANGA IS IN THE NET. SOME PROGRESS IS BEING MADE ON LASANTHA’S MURDER WITH A FORMER INSPECTOR GENERAL OF POLICE AS THE MAIN MAN DISPOSING OF VITAL EVIDENCE!!! GOOD LORD!

       " 'Vanuit het buitenland was er al kritiek, maar ook in het binnenland groeit de onvrede over de ‘oorlog tegen drugs’ van de Filippijnse president Rodrigo Duterte.\\nPresident Duterte heeft dinsdag de Filippijnse stad Marawi „bevrijd van terroristische invloed” verklaard. Al bijna vijf maanden vecht het leger op het zuidelijke eiland Mindanao tegen rebellen van IS die de stad hadden ingenomen. Volgens een legercommandant wordt er toch nog gevochten in Marawi. In de stad zouden er nog tussen de dertig en tachtig rebellen zijn die ook nog burgers gegijzeld houden. Het zou „een kwestie van dagen” zijn voor de laatste strijders zijn verslagen. Hij noemde Dutertes uitspraak een „strategische mededeling”. Het leger erkende eerder de kracht van de IS-strijders te hebben onderschat.\\nDe steun in de Filippijnen voor dit genadeloze beleid, waarbij de politie ‘verdachten’ van drugshandel zonder pardon mag doden, leek onvoorwaardelijk. Tot vorige week Dutertes populariteitscijfers ineens waren gedaald.\\nIn juni beoordeelden de Filippino’s hem nog als ‘heel goed’, volgens een landelijke peiling, nu was het oordeel gezakt naar ‘goed’. Een meerderheid van 67 procent is nog tevreden met zijn functioneren, maar een gegroeide groep van 19 procent is ontevreden.\\nDuterte kwam na deze tegenvallende cijfers meteen in actie. Hij verschoof de uitvoering van het drugsbeleid van de politie naar het antidrugsagentschap, een veel kleinere organisatie met minder mankracht. Zij moeten zich meer op de grote jongens in de drugshandel richten en minder op straatdealers. Er zullen dus minder doden vallen, zei Duterte in de rede waarin hij de wissel aankondigde. Hopelijk zijn de „bloedende harten en de media” dan tevreden, zei hij erbij.\\nLees ook het profiel dat vorig jaar in NRC verscheen: Rodrigo Duterte: moordenaar of crime fighter?\\nDuterte kent ‘nul integriteit’\\nPresident Duterte is „extreem goed in het bespelen van de publieke opinie en kent nul integriteit”, zegt Phelim Kine, plaatsvervangend directeur Azië van mensenrechtenorganisatie Human Rights Watch. Kine is sceptisch over de „onderbreking” van het politiegeweld en noemt dit een „pr-exercitie”. Al laat Duterte er ook mee zien dat hij gevoelig is voor kritiek – van buitenaf en nu steeds meer van binnenuit.\\nBelangrijke aanleiding voor Dutertes dalende populariteit is de dood van een 17-jarige schooljongen deze zomer. Kian Loyd delos Santos was in augustus één van de bijna honderd slachtoffers van een aantal grote politieacties.\\nDe politie loog overduidelijk over zijn doodsoorzaak en dat lokte demonstraties uit. Voor het eerst gingen honderden mensen de straat op om tegen de politie te protesteren. De tiener werd het symbool van de weerstand tegen het politiegeweld, dat geregeld minderjarigen raakt.\\nBekijk ook: de fotoserie De ontsporende drugsoorlog in de Filippijnen\\nDe senaat stelde een onderzoek in naar Kians dood. Dat was uitzonderlijk, gezien de vele duizenden doden die al zijn gevallen. De politie zegt in anderhalf jaar tijd bijna vierduizend mensen te hebben gedood, mensenrechtenorganisaties schatten de aantallen veel hoger in. Duizenden anderen zijn onder verdachte omstandigheden neergeschoten, vaak door schimmige doodseskaders. „Moord is overheidsbeleid geworden onder Duterte. Krijg die geest maar eens terug in de fles”, zegt Kine.\\nVertrouwen van de bevolking\\nDe politie is nu dus van haar taken ontheven. Een begin van het einde van de wrede war on drugs? Dat hoeft niet. In januari presenteerde Duterte precies hetzelfde besluit. Na een week of vijf gaf hij de politie de leiding alweer terug, want de drugs „was terug op straat”. Zoiets kan nu weer gebeuren.\\nDutertes populariteit mag zijn gedaald, volgens een andere peiling hebben vier op de vijf Filippino’s nog steeds vertrouwen in hem. Hoewel driekwart van hen gelooft dat buitengerechtelijke moorden plaatsvinden, is 88 procent nog steeds voorstander van deze oorlog tegen drugs. Kine noemt het „ontnuchterend” dat wreed beleid zoveel steun krijgt. „Het laat zien hoe gefrustreerd de burgers zijn over hun rampzalige rechtsstaat.”\\nIn augustus vielen minstens 58 doden bij anti-drugsacties in Filippijnen. Daarmee was het een van de bloedigste weken sinds het begin van de zogeheten ‘oorlog tegen drugs’ van president Duterte.\\nEen versie van dit artikel verscheen ook in NRC Handelsblad van 18 oktober 2017',\n",

       " 'OMAHA, Neb. — It\\'s a price tag that would give anyone sticker shock: $14,213.99 for a 90-day supply of generic acid reflux medication.\\nBut when Suzanne Luttig picks up the prescription for the drug, Zegerid, she pays only $24.\\nThe catch? Luttig, a full-time professional photographer in Omaha, works an extra 25 hours a week at a bank primarily to help pay for the medication, which she says she cannot do without.\\n\"Because I have health insurance with my employer, I am able to be covered for this medication,\" said Luttig, who provided NBC News with a receipt for her pharmacy medication. \"I would not be able to get it if I didn\\'t have insurance.\"\\nThe price of her generic version of Zegerid, which is manufactured by Dr. Reddy\\'s Laboratories, is significantly higher than the sum of the prices of its main ingredients: omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate. When bought separately, the two individual drugs would cost about $34 for her three-month supply with a coupon.\\nZegerid is what\\'s known as a combination drug — a medication that combines two or more existing drugs — into a single pill or product. While they are convenient for consumers, experts say the price tag of the products contributes to the high cost of health care in America.\\n\"We\\'re not talking about transformative new therapies,\" said Dr. Chana Sacks, an internist and medical researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. \"We\\'re talking about very small tweaks to medicines that we have been using for these very reasons for years.\"\\nSacks authored a 2018 study on the subject that found that brand-name combination drugs cost Medicare $925 million more in 2016 than their generic components.\\nSuzanne Luttig says she would not have been able to afford the generic medication Zegerid if she didn\\'t have health insurance through her employer. Nightly News\\nIn one example from the study, Merck\\'s Fosamax Plus D had a list price of $39.05 per pill, while its generic components, Alendronate (used to prevent and treat certain types of bone loss) and vitamin D3, cost $1.25. And for Bausch Health Companies Inc., the manufacturer of Zegerid, the list price sits at $86.29 per pill, versus 47 cents for omeprazole (generic Prilosec) and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda).\\nBut the stark difference in pricing goes largely unnoticed as consumers are drawn in by low copayments, some as little as $10. Meanwhile, physicians may also be unaware of a drug\\'s cost, Sacks said.\\n\"As a physician, I often don\\'t know what the medications that I prescribe cost. And then when a patient goes to pick it up at the pharmacy, they only see what their copay is,\" she said.\\n\"I think the fact that, from the time that a prescriber writes the prescription till the patient picks it up, nobody knows what the price tag is [is] hugely problematic.\"\\nLuttig said it wasn\\'t until she was waiting for the insurance coverage from a new job to kick in that she realized how much her prescription was listed for.\\n\"I asked the pharmacist, I said, \\'Are you kidding me?\\'\" she said. \"And they said, \\'No, we\\'re not kidding you.\\' I went, \\'OK. I don\\'t think I\\'ll get this refilled today.\\'\"\\n\"It\\'s an abuse of the system,\" said Devon Herrick, a health economist and former hospital accountant who examined drug makers who reformulate over-the-counter drugs into expensive combination drugs.\\n\"Their business model essentially involves gouging insurers and health plans, which ultimately costs consumers,\" he wrote in an analysis.\\nDr. Chana Sacks, an internist and medical researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Nightly News\\nHerrick\\'s analysis focused on two drugs made by Horizon Therapeutics, Duexis and Vimovo, and pointed out ways that companies prevent patients from experiencing sticker-shock, like offering coupons and working with specialty pharmacies.\\nHorizon outlines its strategy in financial filings, in which the company acknowledges concerns about pharmacists\\' substitutions of less expensive options.\\n\"We have faced challenges due to pharmacists increasingly switching a patient\\'s intended prescription from DUEXIS and VIMOVO to a generic or over-the-counter brand of their active ingredients,\" the company wrote in a 2016 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\\nThe company\\'s solution? A financial assistance program called HorizonCares, which works with specific partner pharmacies to dispense the drugs and reduce patients\\' out-of-pocket costs.\\n\"Part of our commercial strategy to increase adoption and access to our medicines in the face of these incentives to use generic alternatives is to offer physicians the opportunity to have patients fill prescriptions through independent pharmacies participating in our HorizonCares patient access program, including shipment of prescriptions to patients,\" the 2019 quarterly filing reads.\\nHerrick sees it as a way to work around pharmacies that might suggest less expensive options.\\n\"If a drug company has to go around the local pharmacy and sign up independent pharmacies, it\\'s a case of gaming the health care system,\" Herrick said. \"They try to circumvent the local pharmacy from saying \\'that\\'s over the counter.\\'\"\\nPrograms like HorizonCares are a way companies can bypass incentives to buy the cheapest drug and sidestep the competitive process, Herrick said, adding: \"It\\'s a strategy we probably shouldn\\'t tolerate as a society.\"\\nHorizon disputes the characterization. \"The reality here is that our co-pay support programs help address payer attempts to prevent patients from receiving the medicine their doctor prescribed based on reasons other than clinical benefit,\" the company said in an email to NBC News. Horizon also points out that there is specific language in labeling approved by the Food and Drug Administration that cautions patients not to substitute other medicines for their prescribed medications.\\nClick here to read the full statement from Horizon Therapeutics\\nNBC News asked the FDA why it approved a label suggesting that patients not substitute the two generics for the combo drug and was told to make a request under the Freedom of Information Act. Two months later, NBC News received the documents: The FDA acknowledges that \"the individual components of Duexis are readily available over-the-counter.\" An agency reviewer also notes that \"the potential exists for the formulation to be dosed comitantly in place of Duexis.\" But in the end, the reviewer calls the label \"reasonable,\" citing in part the fact that Duexis uses 26.6 mg of the stomach protectant famotidine. Over the counter, the commonly available strengths are 20 mg and 40 mg.\\n\"Is that really innovation?\" asks Sacks. \"We\\'re talking a couple of milligrams of a dose that no doctor that I know thinks is a clinically significant change. And I just bring it back to — at what cost?\"\\nSacks points out that if a patient takes the recommended dose of three pills a day of Duexis, she could get the same amount of stomach protectant by taking two over-the-counter meds of 40 mg each.\\nMatt Eyles, president and chief executive of the health insurance trade group America\\'s Health Insurance Plans, said: \"Drug prices are out of control, and millions of hard-working Americans feel the consequences every day. While new drugs may offer breakthrough cures, repackaging old over-the-counter or generic medications and charging unaffordable prices is not the kind of innovation Americans need.\"\\nWhen Horizon bought Vimovo from another drug maker, AstraZeneca, in 2013, the list price for the drug was $114, according to GoodRx, a drug-pricing website. Within weeks, according to a GoodRx analysis, the company raised the list price to $799. Six years and nine price hikes later, the list price is $2,482.\\n\"I think we\\'ve long uncoupled the cost of R&D [research and development] being the reason for these price hikes,\" Sacks said. \"I don\\'t think there\\'s any evidence to show that that\\'s really the link in these prices.\"\\nIn a 2014 SEC filing shortly after the acquisition, the company laid out its strategy to raise prices.\\n\"Our strategy with respect to Vimovo included bringing its pricing in line with Duexis and thereby significantly increasing the value realized per prescription,\" reads the filing.\\nAnd the practice appears to have been effective. Beginning in 2014, the drugs have had the same periodic increases — a jump of more than 1,600 percent for both drugs over the years.\\n\"We look at ... what the market will bear,\" Horizon President and Chief Executive Timothy Walbert said in a 2015 interview with CNBC when asked how the company was able to raise the price on acquired drugs like Vimovo when they are not changing the drug.\\nWalbert also said that the money from the price hikes helps them create access for patients who can\\'t afford the drug.\\nHorizon told NBC News that these drugs, which provide pain relief and a stomach protectant in a single pill, provide better protection for patients at risk of gastrointestinal complications than taking the components separately.\\nIn a statement, Horizon said out-of-pocket costs for 98 percent of all commercially insured patients are $10 or less. It also said the price it receives per prescription has been decreasing and was less than $300 in 2018.\\nBut it adds up. According to SEC filings, from 2011 to 2018, the two drugs have brought in more than $1.3 billion for the company.\\nMeanwhile, for patients who have come to rely on the medications at low personal cost, there can be a snag down the line.\\nMary Meyer, a medical assistant in the Chicago suburbs, said she was pleasantly surprised to hear about the possibility of a low copay for her prescription of Duexis.\\n\"I\\'m like, that\\'s awesome,\" Meyer said when she heard from a Horizon representative that a specialty pharmacy would charge her a copay of only $10 for the drug, which her doctor had prescribed to treat her flare-ups of lower back and hip pain.\\nBut when Meyer turned 65 in December 2018 and switched from a commercial plan to Medicare, she learned that the government plan doesn\\'t accept copayment coupons from manufacturers. So even after picking up a supplemental Medicare Part D plan to cover Duexis, she still finds herself unable to afford the $1,300 bill she said she was quoted for a 90-pill prescription at Walmart.\\n\"Unless I win the lotto, I\\'m not paying it,\" she said.\\nFor now, she is rationing the pills that are left in her last bottle.\\n\"I have not picked up a prescription since I have been on Medicare,\" she said. \"I take it as infrequently as possible.\"\\nDownload the NBC News app for breaking news\\nAs patients grapple with these issues, they can\\'t really turn to the federal government.\\n\"It\\'s important to realize that the FDA, when it comes to drug pricing, really doesn\\'t have a role in our current system,\" Chana Sacks said. \"When the FDA is considering approval of a drug, cost is not part of the consideration.\"\\nIn fact, the FDA states on its website that it has \"no legal authority to investigate or control the prices.\"\\nWhile combination drugs go through an FDA approval process that evaluates a drug for safety and efficacy, critics say the process does not prove that the new drug is actually superior to its generic components.\\nDr. Enrique Seoane-Vazquez, a professor at Chapman University\\'s School of Pharmacy, co-authored a 2015 study documenting an increase in the number of FDA approvals of combination drugs over time. He claims there is a financial incentive to make the products available.\\n\"The main reason is the profits the pharmaceuticals [companies] have from this and the low development costs,\" he said, adding that returns on investment can be higher than those for medications needing more research and development to produce.\\nSome physicians say they are unconvinced that there is a therapeutic difference between many single-pill combinations and their generic alternatives.\\n\"Patients are paying more for something that is not necessarily more beneficial or safe,\" said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran, a family medicine doctor at the Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center and a former research faculty member at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. At NBC News\\' request, Ramachandran reviewed the FDA approval packages for several brand name combination drugs and found no significant therapeutic difference from between the combination drugs and their generic components.\\nWhat\\'s more, the FDA does not require the companies to prove a new drug is superior to existing drugs on the market. \"My message to the companies is if the drugs are truly effective, prove it, show they are superior,\" said Ramachandran, who also leads the Drug Affordability Action Team at Doctors for America, a physician advocacy group that lobbies for access to affordable, quality health care.\\n\"Approving drugs which fail to show true therapeutic benefit and giving them the designation of being a \\'new drug application\\' means that our healthcare system is setting a low bar for which is truly novel,\" she wrote in an email to NBC News. \"This is incentivizing companies to not invest in true innovation that will truly help our patients, but instead on low-hanging fruit ... that they then heavily market to patients and providers.\"\\nShe said that is especially true when it comes to Zegerid. Upon reviewing the approval package for the capsule version of the drug, Ramachandran said she does not see any added benefits to prescribing it and cannot justify the price to her patients.\\nMeanwhile, the list price for 30 capsules of 40 mg/1100 mg brand name Zegerid has gone from $101.10 in 2007 to $3,306.82, the GoodRx analysis shows.\\nWhen asked about the drug\\'s price and therapeutic difference from its component medications, a representative for Bausch Health said it \"is unable to provide a comment at this time.\"\\nDr. Reddy\\'s Laboratories, the manufacturer of Luttig\\'s generic Zegerid, told NBC News that it \"cannot comment on the prices that consumers pay for drugs at the pharmacy.\" The drug company also said medication costs are determined by \"many factors,\" including a person\\'s prescription drug or medical plan.\\nThe maker of brand name Zegerid declined to comment.\\nThe lack of answers has baffled consumers like Luttig.\\n\"I don\\'t understand why, when you have Prilosec, which is a reasonable over-the-counter drug, and baking soda, and you put those two together, why does it, all of a sudden, become $14,000? I don\\'t get it,\" she said. (Since NBC News began reporting this story several months ago, Luttig\\'s insurer changed what it will cover, now reimbursing half the generic Zegerid it used to for Luttig\\'s prescription.)\\nSacks warns consumers to be vigilant about drug prices in America.\\n\"In that absolute moment where you\\'re standing at the pharmacy counter and you can afford that medication and it\\'s not an issue, I can understand why it seems like those doesn\\'t affect us,\" she said.\\nBut she said: \"These higher costs will be reflected in all of our premiums. The higher costs that we\\'re paying today are going to be reflected tomorrow.\"\\nJaime Longoria and Didi Martinez reported from New York.',\n",

       " 'As a number of US states experiment with the legal regulation of marijuana, the issue of drug reform is increasingly debated.\\nBackground\\nAfter decades of global prohibition encompassing virtually all drugs except alcohol, there are signs that major reform of drug laws is starting to become a possibility. There is a growing awareness among researchers and policymakers that the current system of prohibition has failed in its goals. The proliferation of new psychoactive chemicals, along with technological developments that have created novel and covert distribution channels, pose real questions over the ability of law enforcement to keep up with the vast criminal enterprises that currently profit from the status quo.\\nIn the 1920s, the United States banned the sale of alcohol, a policy that resulted in the opening of thousands of illegal bars across the county and led to the rapid rise of the mafia. Once this misguided experiment was brought to an end, criminal groups and the authorities shifted their focus to drugs. The following decades saw the introduction of increasingly restrictive policies, culminating in the 1961 UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, and the War on Drugs spearheaded by US President Richard Nixon soon after.\\nDespite billions of dollars spent on interdiction, incarceration and eradication, drug use has continued to rise. The UN estimates that around 243 million people use illegal drugs, and the global trade is worth around $435 billion. This money is absorbed by vast criminal enterprises and even terrorist organizations.\\nIn the US, punitive drug laws have led to the development of an expansive prison industrial complex, with the prison population growing exponentially since the 1970s. This has been characterized by huge racial disparities in arrests, prosecutions and sentencing.\\nMeanwhile, evidence from several countries has shown the dangers of attempting to tackle by force the gangs who control the market. In large parts of Mexico, the ongoing drug war launched by President Felipe Calderon in 2006 has resulted in the collapse of law and order, with tens of thousands of people having been killed since.\\nIn recent years, two further advances have served to highlight the failure of the current system of prohibition. In 2009, first in Europe and then the US, the illegal drugs market was flooded with a set of “legal highs,” because they were developed and circulated faster than laws banning their sale could be passed. This short-circuiting of the law was solidified with the concurrent development of murky online marketplaces, concealed in the shadows of the dark web, most notably the Silk Road. These marketplaces have allowed drug users to buy virtually any quantity of any drug they like, and efforts by the authorities to shut them down have struggled to keep apace with the technological experts behind them.\\nWhy is Drug Reform Relevant?\\nWith the failures of drugs prohibition increasingly evident, recent years have seen the first tentative calls for change at a high level. Foremost on the reformist agenda is the moving of drug policy out of the criminal justice realm and into that of health. A harm reduction approach of this type is seen as a crucial first step in solving the problems currently caused by drugs and drug laws, but many go further and claim that only through legalization of the bulk of illegal narcotics can the criminal trade be brought under control.\\nLegalization in this sense does not imply an open market free-for-all, but rather the regulation of substances — in a manner similar to pharmaceuticals or alcohol, depending on the drug — so the highly lucrative trade is taken out of the hands of criminals and put into those of governments, thereby allowing not just for taxation, but also a much greater degree of quality control, reducing harm to users.\\nWhile the Netherlands’ long-time toleration of cannabis will no doubt be the most famous example of a country experimenting with a more liberal approach to drugs, it has perhaps been Portugal that has taken the boldest step to date. In 2001, all possession or use of small quantities of drugs ceased to be a criminal infraction, instead being dealt with through treatment or community service programs. In the years following the change in policy, drug use among adolescents and so-called “problematic” users declined, as did the rate of HIV infections in what had been the worst-affected country in the European Union. Nevertheless, all production and supply has been left in the hands of criminals.\\nWith such a positive sign of the potential of policies that favor harm reduction over punishment, the calls for change gathered pace. In 2009, the chairman of the British government’s Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, Professor David Nutt, was fired by the Home Office following his calls for the laws over individual drugs to more accurately reflect their harms.\\nHis argument featured the now notorious claim that statistically, taking ecstasy is no more harmful than horse riding. Two years later, a panel of officials called the Global Commission on Drug Policy released a report calling for an end to the War on Drugs. The commission includes former Secretary-General of the UN Kofi Annan, former US Secretary of State George Schultz and the former presidents of several of the countries most affected by the illegal drug trade, including Brazil, Colombia and Mexico.\\nOf course, calls for liberalization have not been as forthcoming from serving politicians, though notable exceptions have arisen. In 2012, then-President José Mujica went against public opinion and began the process of legalizing cannabis in Uruguay, while newly elected President Tabaré Vázquez has said he will keep the policy unless it produces negative results. In January 2014, US President Barack Obama — whose administration has abandoned the phrase “War on Drugs” — stated that cannabis was no more harmful than alcohol. Most recently, Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker resigned from his post as a UK Home Office minister following a dispute with Home Secretary Theresa May, when the latter reportedly tried to block the release of a government-commissioned report that found tough laws did not lead to lower drug use.\\nNevertheless, serious change is still some distance away. The British government shrugged off Baker’s challenge with little concern, instead continuing to highlight the dangers entailed by certain drugs, such as high-strength “skunk” cannabis. In the US, Obama has in fact done very little to change the legal situation, beyond placing a stronger emphasis on treatment and going some way to addressing the long-standing disparity between crack and cocaine penalties, seen by many as racially biased.\\nA number of US states may be experimenting with the legal regulation of cannabis, but only with the tolerance — not approval — of the federal government, with no guarantee that this will continue into a future administration. While the likes of Uruguay, the Netherlands and Portugal may be seen as setting useful examples of different approaches, we are likely still some way off from any government experimenting with the broad regulation of illicit drugs. Yet the dialogue is starting to change, and with that, the prospect of the law following suit will only increase.\\nWe bring you perspectives from around the world. Help us to inform and educate.

People come because the drugs are there.' Photo by Susan Gamble\\nArticle content In record time, a Cambridge man was arrested, processed, pleaded guilty in Simcoe’s Ontario Court and was sent to prison for dealing in pink fentanyl. In fact, the 16 days from capture to incarceration was about a week longer than necessary because Justice Aubrey Hilliard insisted on setting up a video conference rather than sentencing Kenneth David Kerr, 45, by audio alone. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Drug dealer rushes to prison Back to video And that was to Kerr’s advantage as Hilliard watched him make a 10-minute, emotional explanation of his addiction and ongoing criminal history. “I know I have a lengthy criminal record,” Kerr said. “I’m an alcoholic and a drug addict and that’s what they do. They seek out bad behaviours.” On April 14, Kerr was stopped at 10:20 a.m. by an OPP Community Street Crime Unit on a tip from a confidential informant. He got out of his vehicle and, leaving the keys inside, locked it. But Kerr had left the passenger side window down and when police searched his vehicle they found about $3,000 worth of pink fentanyl and cocaine and $4,180 in cash. They also found a small digital weigh scale and small plastic bags.\\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\\nArticle content Kerr could have fought, noted the judge. He could have drawn it out and insisted on a trial and he could have gone through the process of getting a pre-sentence report to outline his addictions and problems. Instead, he waived his right to a lawyer and a preliminary hearing – and even his right to wait for chemical analysis to come back proving that the drugs were indeed fentanyl and cocaine – and insisted on being sentenced as soon as possible. Hilliard questioned Kerr about his rush to judgment, warning him that federal prosecutor Jamie Pereira was asking for a sentence of three-and-a-half years. “It’s highly unlikely I will sentence you to more than that but you understand that three and a half years is a possibility and you still wish to plead guilty,” said Hilliard. “Yes,” Kerr insisted before explaining that he was, however, asking the judge to consider a two-year sentence. Pereira said the longer sentence was important since fentanyl has led to the deaths of many Canadians and Kerr has an extensive criminal record. “He’s had 68 prior convictions – eight of them for trafficking, another seven for simple possession and a conviction in 2019 for having the proceeds of drug trafficking so it’s a very significant record and he’s only 45.” Pereira agreed Kerr’s speedy guilty plea was a sign of remorse but noted he’s been back before the court so many times it’s an indication that rehabilitation isn’t working. In his speech to the judge, Kerr said whether he got a short or long prison sentence, he would still get the programming he needs.\\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\\nArticle content “I have a family that needs me and that’s the only reason I’ve made it very easy to plead guilty. I’ve let my family down once again. I have a seven-year-old daughter that I haven’t seen since she was two years old,” he told the judge. “I have a mother who is dying and I don’t know how to handle it.” Kerr was also expecting to become a grandfather in June. “It’s a vicious cycle. As soon as things go wrong in my life I fall back into this cycle and I can’t stop it on my own. I’ve tried and tried and tried and I never end up having a better life. It’s always worse.” Kerr said he didn’t want to be characterized as an out-of-town drug dealer who came to Simcoe to prey on the locals. “People think Simcoe is a place where people come to sell drugs but it’s the opposite. People come because the drugs are there.” He told the judge he wants to one day live like a “normal person” but struggles with stopping himself. “God knows I do not like my life. I do not like continually going to jail and letting my family down once again. I’m willing to change. I just don’t know how.” Hilliard weighed that speech, Kerr’s fast plea and the substantial savings he created by not spending one or two years going through the criminal justice system, against the seriousness of the drugs he was peddling. “Fentanyl is a scourge on our society and must be met with significant sentences,” she said. “Mr. Kerr is also a vulnerable user and rehabilitation has not been successful. This is a journey he has to walk on his own.” Recognizing both Kerr’s remorse and the pandemic situation, Hilliard opted to give him a month of time served credit and sent him to prison for a further two and a half years. “This is a somewhat lighter sentence than case law would suggest,” she said. “Your situation might not get much better at a federal institution but I hope you’re able to get the benefit from counselling services so that when you’re released you will have the tools you need to make better choices. “We’ve seen each other now two times. I hope this will be the last time and I wish you luck.” SGamble@postmedia.com @EXPSGamble\\nShare this article in your social network\\nLatest National Stories Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\\nNews Near Brantford\",\n",

       " 'The recent targeting of two alleged Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operatives near Tres Marias underscores a shift in the character of the Mexican drug war. Increased American participation in the conflict will make Americans targets. Moreover, the proposed establishment of a gendarmerie or paramilitary force marks a new stage in Mexico’s own internal strategy against the cartels. This unfolds amidst a shift in the internal cartel balance of power and the further internationalization of the drug war.\\nUnderstanding the “New” Drug War\\nSince Mexican President Felipe Calderón began the crackdown on Mexican drug cartels, we can understand the effects of Mexican policy as a confluence of several broad trends: militarization, internationalization, fractalization, and consolidation.\\nBy involving the armed forces, Calderon responded to the inability of the Mexican local police to crush the effort. The chief problem with the effort was that the enemy’s strengths were truly multimodal: the cartels could achieve local dominance through their firepower and the selective use of Mexican political institutions they had captured for their own means. Carl von Clausewitz has noted that war is “politics by other means” and in war violence serves the purpose of policy. The political end state—the purging of cartels from Mexican institutions and the curtailment of their networks—demanded violence to serve politics but required political maneuver as well.\\nMexico’s drug war is in large part an elite conflict born of the consequences of political transition, and any strategy that neglected the cartel role in the constitution of internal Mexican political space would be doomed to either political failure at worst or protracted war at best. The latter was exactly what occurred, as Calderón’s effort faltered at the local levels of implementation. Cartels frustrated the Mexican government’s efforts to tame their networks in the plazas that dominate the Mexican drug economy. Moreover, throwing the military at the cartels resulted in a severe cartel reaction fueling extreme hyper-violence, barbarization, symbolic violence, and attacks on journalists to shape the information space.\\nCartels also responded to the challenge with their own militarization. In a new environment with fiercer competition from a now predatory state and rivals seeking to exploit gaps in the market, they turned their illicit capital towards acquiring heavy arsenals, command and control equipment, and armored vehicles for tactical mobility. Moreover, leaders optimized for warfare came to dominate cartel organizations as the “old guard” borne of a more peaceful time were shuffled aside. Cartels, in response to the challenge levied against them, became warmaking entities with concrete military capabilities.\\nOf course, the rapid pace of the drug war and the attrition it inflicted also caused cartels to shift their structure as well. Many broke apart, whereas others, like the Zetas, grew from humble roots to become transnational networks. Cartel leaders, though bound by common rituals, quasi-ideologies, and local backgrounds also constantly struggle for control of their own organizations. Prior to the death of ‘El Lazca’ the Zetas were reportedly experiencing an apparent large power struggle. In the aftermath, internal Zeta power may be consolidating; rival cartels may exploit the transition.\\nTwo competing trends are seen in the battle for cartel dominance. First, we see fractalization where cartels split into factions and smaller gangs fill the void in power. Second, there is a rise in alliances or ‘megacarteles’ (mega-cartels) such as the Sinaloa Federation and the Zetas. The oligarchy of multiple competing cartels at the national level appears to be shifting to a bi-polar duopoly. Should one bloc dominate after the battle between the Zetas and Sinaloa, the resulting uni-polar power structure would essentially result in a neo-feudal arrangement where a single narco-overlord would oversee a network of local tributary gangs.\\nThe impact of cartel business has always been viewed as US centric. While the ultimate source of the profits is up North, the expansion of cartel base areas in Guatemala, Honduras and other Central American countries as well as links to Europe and West Africa make this a global concern. On the Mexican side, greater US military and intelligence involvement underscored the US’ desire to pursue an indirect strategy to help Mexico deal with a potentially lethal problem. The intensity of the drug war also loosened the traditional Mexican antipathy towards the United States, to the point where many Mexicans (especially in Northern Mexico) came to see American involvement as a net plus. This perception may be fleeting.\\nThe Return of the PRI and Cartel Strategy\\nThe return of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) is a sign of both continuity and change in the conflict. The Mexican public is weary of the war but does not necessarily support giving up. Rather, it is looking for a different strategy. The PRI does not–at least initially–tremendously differ from the National Action Party–PAN’s approach, save in one important aspect: it does not buy into Calderón’s idea of a theory of victory over the cartels. This reflects an erosion of public trust in institutions that has occurred as a result of the unfavorable cartel war, the capture of federal and local institutions by cartels, and the military’s own heavy-handed efforts. In fact, the PRI, like the PAN, neglected talking much about the drug war at all during the election campaign.\\nDuring the campaign, Enrique Peña Nieto (EPN) eschewed talk of the military role or even the large seizures characteristic of the Calderón era. The central political idea that prompted the drug war—a Mexico free of drug cartel capture of its institutions and political spaces—is gone. EPN has discussed instead creating a civilian gendarme force for local security, targeting small gangs, and other similar ideas. This, of course, does not mean that EPN will simply make a “pact” with drug cartels—a political, if not practical impossibility. Even if the PRI could strike a bargain with one or several cartels the result wouldn’t be a simple return to the status quo ante where the party and state had the upper hand in state-cartel relations and could dictate terms favorable to the state and moderated violence. The cartels have gained too much relative power and control over turf and transactions to turn back the clock. But it does mean that the PRI is looking to moderate or stabilize the drug war, continuing previous policies while attempting to lower the political cost. An enhanced focus on ‘counter-violence’ strategies can be expected. As some Mexican analysts have noted, if Calderón had a faulty theory of victory, EPN has not articulated one.\\nThere are long-term costs to protracted war without concurrent reform of political institutions and law enforcement systems. These costs are not only human, but also are political in nature. Erosion of public faith in institutions and the expansion of cartel power bases have had a destabilizing effect on the Mexican public sphere, as well as making efforts at establishing local security more difficult.\\nOne wild card is the appointment of former Colombian national police chief Óscar Naranjo Trujillo as chief security advisor. While many analogies to Mexico and Colombia have been articulated, the configuration of government authority and local threats in both nations differ immensely. From one perspective, Naranjo could be a sign of the PRI’s commitment to continue to fight the cartels. But his appointment may also be more indicative of symbolism than resoluteness.\\nContrary to some predictions, EPN has not curtailed American involvement. Indeed, one of the gradual trends of the last few years has been the deepening of American military involvement in the cartel wars. Such involvement, however, brings new risks. As in other areas in Latin America, the US is heavily involved in cooperation with Latin American law enforcement and military agencies. The cartels networks, however, are noting the presence of the US as an important actor in the war and could be testing American willingness to fight.\\nAttempting to kill intelligence operatives is one way to send a message that American involvement will have costs, but not one as potentially dangerous as targeted killings of American law enforcement officers on US soil. Mexico is not a permissive operational environment. Cartels can and will utilize their control of Mexican institutions—especially at state and municipal levels—strategically to frustrate American attempts at neutralizing their control. Corruption, collusion, and confrontation will remain the key instruments of narcopolicy (narcopolítica).\\nTowards Strategy?\\nStrategy for the drug war must rest on strong assumptions. First, cartels are warmaking entities with substantial firepower, intelligence, and political clout. Reducing violence as a strategy in order to create a new equilibrium will not in itself resolve the basic political dispute between a state and substate actors looking to seize control or manipulate the state’s legitimate and illegitimate institutions. Second, American involvement will not be ignored or regarded as neutral. Rather, cartels will seek to thwart American involvement while remaining careful to avoid undue escalation.\\nLastly, the drug war will continue regardless of EPN’s election. The drug war has upset the delicate equilibrium that formerly existed between the state and organized crime. The Mexican public may be weary of war but still desires a crackdown against crime. The cartels themselves has changed and political accommodation is no longer possible. As the US draws down in Afghanistan, the struggle south of the border continues.',\n",

Image: US law enforcement / AP\\nThe Notorious Mexican drug lord known as 'El Chapo' will be sentenced in New York City on Thursday after his capture and extradition in Mexico. 62-year-old Joaquin 'el Chapo' ...\\nJoaquin “El Chapo” Guzman’s long, dramatic run as one of the world’s most notorious druglords is over.\\nA judge in a US Federal Court on Wednesday handed down a life sentence — plus a symbolic extra 30 years for good measure — to mark the end of decades of the 62-year-old former drug boss’ drug trafficking, cold-blooded killings and prison escapes worthy of a Hollywood film.\\nThe evidence at an 11-week trial showed his Sinaloa cartel was responsible for smuggling mountains of cocaine and other drugs into the United States during his 25-year reign, prosecutors said in recent court papers.\\nWitnesses also described the cartel boss beating, shooting and even burying alive those who got in his way, including informants and members of rival gangs.\\nSpeaking to AFP, New York’s special narcotics prosecutor Bridget Brennan acknowledged removing El Chapo from the equation did not diminish the Sinaloa cartel’s heavy influence on drug pathways into the US.\\nStill, New York’s head special agent for Homeland Security Investigations, Angel Melendez, said the sentencing marked “the end of the line”.\\n“The sentence separates the myth of El Chapo from the man Joaquin Guzman,” Mr Melendez said. “It’s a reality, he’ll never be able to escape.”\\nRAGS TO RICHES\\nAs a child living in poverty in Mexico, Guzman peddled fruit just to eat. A lifetime later, as the world’s most wanted drug lord, his empire was so vast he commanded a fleet of submarines to move his wares.\\nA conservative estimate of revenues from his cartel’s drug sales in the United States is pegged at about $US12.6 billion ($A18 billion). He was said to have such a surplus of cash it was stored in warehouses, the drug boss so rich he was unable to spend it all.\\nBut Guzman spent some of his estimated wealth on a private zoo, a diamond-encrusted pistol and paying off police and politicians.\\nUntil his 2017 arrest and extradition to the US, El Chapo was considered to be the most powerful druglord since Colombia’s Pablo Escobar. He was the co-leader of the Sinaloa organisation from 1989 until 2014.\\nPRISON BREAKS\\nHaving already escaped from one maximum-security prison in 2001, concealed in a laundry cart after bribing his guards, El Chapo pulled it off again in 2015.\\nThe cartel boss drew on his experience with transporting drugs via a network of secret passageways to make a Houdini-like escape from a Mexican maximum-security prison when he rode a motorcycle on a track through a tunnel after he slipped out of his cell through a hole he carved in the bathroom.\\nThe Sinaloa drug cartel leader’s henchmen took about eight months to build the 1.5 kilometre tunnel, about 10 metres underground, complete with a generator to pump air into it.\\nThey disguised the machine by building a barbecue pit over it.\\nThe shoddy hole El Chapo slipped through was in the shower next to his toilet — a splattered, stained hole in the floor. Immediately underneath, his crew built a small chamber.\\nA crude ladder helped him descend deeper into the hole.\\nOnce on the outside, according to one witness, El Chapo was met by his wife, and the pair embarked on a life in hiding. He was recaptured after six months on the run.\\nOne of the trial’s most memorable tales came from one of his lovers, Lucero Guadalupe Sanchez Lopez, who testified she was in bed in a safe house with an on-the-run Guzman when Mexican marines started breaking down his door.\\nShe said Guzman led her to a trap door beneath a bathtub that opened up to a tunnel that allowed them to escape.\\nAsked what he was wearing, she replied: “He was naked. He took off running. He left us behind.”\\nNETWORK OF TUNNELS\\nThrough a maze of narrow underground tunnels, bloodthirsty drug kingpin Guzman trafficked billions of dollars worth of cocaine from Mexico to the United States.\\nAt his trial, jurors took a virtual tour through a secret passageway equipped with electric lights, stretching from Mexico to an Arizona warehouse just two blocks from a US Customs Office, where the floor under a pool table lifted with a hydraulic system to reveal the hidden tunnel.\\nThe structure was just high enough for a 1.8m-tall person to walk through with their head slightly bent — perfect for El Chapo, whose nickname means “shorty” because he stands just 1.7m-tall.\\nThe authorities say piles of cocaine were wheeled through the passages on carts. They claim the infamous drug lord smuggled enough cocaine “for 328 million lines” — more than one for every person in the United States.\\nThe first witness, retired US Customs agent Carlos Salazar, said officials were shocked at the sophistication of the tunnels, using heavy tools to smash their way in on the Mexican side before realising they could open it by twisting a water faucet.\\nCOCAINE SUBMARINES\\nJurors in Guzman’s trial were shown footage of the first-ever US Coast Guard interception of a cocaine-packed submarine.\\nCoast Guard Lieutenant Commander Todd Bagetis, who took part in the September 2008 seizure, said his crew had been patrolling international waters when they came across the semi-submersible, some 563 kilometres east of Guatemala.\\nUsing night-vision goggles, his team boarded the submarine — where an irate crew immediately tried to sink the boat and throw the officers overboard.\\nThe dark footage shows a single head popping up from the hatch and then water flooding the vessel. Mr Bagetis had earlier testified the boats were designed to sink in as little as three to five minutes if desired.\\nOnce they had detained the crew, Mr Bagetis said his team discovered 237 bales of cocaine — about 5896 kilograms.\\nBRIBING THE PRESIDENT\\nAn ex-associate of Guzman testified the accused Mexican drug lord once paid a $US100 million ($A139 million) bribe to former Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.\\nAlex Cifuentes, who has described himself as Guzman’s one-time right-hand man, discussed the alleged bribe under cross-examination by Jeffrey Lichtman, one of Guzman’s lawyers, in US Federal Court.\\nAsked if he told authorities in 2016 that Guzman arranged the bribe, he answered, “That’s right.”\\nMr Pena Nieto has previously denied taking bribes.\\nCifuentes testified he told US prosecutors Pena Nieto initially reached out to Guzman, asking for $US250 million ($A347.6 million).\\nCifuentes told the prosecutors the bribe was paid in October 2012 when Mr Pena Nieto was president-elect, he testified.\\nHe also testified Guzman once told him he had received a message from Mr Pena Nieto saying he did not have to live in hiding anymore.\\nMr Pena Nieto was president of Mexico from December 2012 until November 2018. He was once a rising star in Mexico’s long-dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party.\\nBut the president ended his term a much diminished figure, pummelled by conflict-of-interest scandals, rampant crime and a lacklustre economy.\\nBEAUTY QUEEN WIFE\\nWhen the wife of the notorious drug lord learnt in February her husband had been convicted of trafficking vast quantities of cocaine into the United States and was likely to spend the rest of his life behind bars, her reaction was magnificently calm.\\n“Nobody’s dead,” Emma Coronel Aispuro told those fussing around her, waving away tissues as she swept out of the New York courtroom.\\nThe 29-year-old Kim Kardashian lookalike, the mother of twin daughters with El Chapo, lives a lavish lifestyle, born into a family of Sinaloa cartel members and marrying a man who made an estimated $14 billion as head of the powerful criminal enterprise.\\nMs Coronel met Guzman as a teenager at a party thrown by her father Ines Coronel Barreras, a cattle rancher believed to have grown marijuana and opium poppies for the cartel. Her uncle was slain cartel boss Ignacio “Nacho” Coronel, one of El Chapo’s most trusted men.\\nThen 47, Guzman is said to have arrived with hundreds of gunmen to ensure the 17-year-old pageant queen won the Coffee and Guava Festival in the Mexican state of Durango in 2007, and she became his fourth wife on her 18th birthday.\\nOne of Guzman’s lawyers, Michael Lambert, told news.com.au during the trial: “Her commitment to Joaquin has been absolute, they genuinely love each other very much.”\\nMs Coronel gave birth to their twin daughters in 2012, but Guzman was imprisoned for the second time in his high-profile criminal career in 2014.\\nINTERVIEW WITH SEAN PENN\\nThe unflappable outlaw even met with Hollywood actor Sean Penn during his six months on the run before police tracked him down to a beachfront apartment after a nationwide manhunt.\\nGuzman sat down with Penn for a now-infamous interview in hopes of scoring a book and movie deal, one of his lawyers admitted to jurors during the trial.\\nEl Chapo lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman said the Rolling Stone article about the clandestine sit-down between the Fast Times at Ridgemont High star and the diminutive alleged drug lord was a “crucial piece of evidence in this case”.\\n“Mr Guzman was someone who, for better or for worse, enjoyed the notoriety of being ‘El Chapo’,” Mr Lichtman said.\\n“You’ll find there was an effort by Guzman to have a movie and a book made about him.”\\nPenn and Mexican telenovela actress Kate del Castillo linked up with the notorious accused leader of the Sinaloa cartel at one of his secret hideouts in Mexico in 2015.\\nThe meeting was brokered by del Castillo, who was interested in making a biopic about Guzman.\\nGuzman risked tipping off authorities to his whereabouts in order to do the Penn interview, which was published a day after the accused drug lord was nabbed in January 2016.\\nBut he was desperate for the publicity, his lawyer acknowledged.\\n“Why else would he do something as insane as that?” Mr Lichtman posed to jurors.\\nIn the controversial interview, Guzman brags about his powerful position and shows no qualms about feeding into the violent and deadly drug industry.\\n“I supply more heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana than anybody else in the world,” Guzman boasted. “I have a fleet of submarines, aeroplanes, trucks and boats.”\\nBut Lichtman said Guzman was hellbent on talking up his untouchable status because “if he admitted he was broke”, there’d be no chance of a Hollywood deal.\",\n",

Microeconomic and macroeconomic factors affecting the global erectile dysfunction drugs market are analyzed in the report to provide a comprehensive look into the factors making the erectile dysfunction drugs market tick.\\nRequest Free Sample Report: https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/sample_request/1313\\nIncreasing manufacturing of generic erectile dysfunction drugs as well as the increasing availability of counterfeit erectile dysfunction drugs is likely to remain the key restraint on the global erectile dysfunction drugs market over the forecast period. Due to the patent expiry of blockbuster drugs, many generic variants are coming into the market, usually at lower prices than the former. This is likely to eat into the prospects of the erectile dysfunction drugs market in the coming years, with consumers often preferring lower priced generic variants of erectile dysfunction drugs than more expensive blockbuster varieties.\\nCounterfeiting is also likely to be a major problem for the global erectile dysfunction drugs market, due to the lucrative marketing of counterfeit erectile dysfunction drugs at much lower prices than either patented or generic drugs. In August 2019, a Southern California man was sentenced to more than eight years in prison for illegally smuggling erectile dysfunction products from China. Such cases are likely to remain a key threat for the global erectile dysfunction drugs market over the forecast period.\\nErectile Dysfunction Drugs Market Segmentation:\\nThe global erectile dysfunction drugs market is segmented based on product, end use, and region.\\nBy product, the global erectile dysfunction drugs market is segmented into Viagra, Cialis, Levitra, Stendra, Zydena, and others. Viagra holds a dominant 40% share in the global erectile dysfunction drugs market, with Levitra and Cialis also holding significant shares in the market. This configuration of the market is likely to sustain in the coming years, despite the patent expiry concerns regarding Viagra and the subsequent onslaught of generics.\\nBy end use, the global erectile dysfunction drugs market is segmented into hospitals, clinics, pharmaceutical companies, and others.\\nCompetitive Analysis:\\nLeading players in the global erectile dysfunction drugs market include Apricus Biosciences Inc., S.K. Chemicals Co. Ltd., Dong-A Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Eli Lilly & Co., Bayer AG, and Pfizer Inc.\\nSeoul Pharmaceutical announced plans to export Sildenafil 50mg and 100mg and Tadalafil 20mg to Taiwanese company Ryders International for the next five years. This is a key step in Seoul’s efforts to branch out into the Asian market for ED drugs. The company also exported Aliden suspension to Mongolia in April 2019, as well as receiving sales approval for Sildenafil in Indonesia in August.\\nBrowse Full Research Report at: https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/erectile-dysfunction-drugs-market-1313\\nRegional Analysis:\\nThe Americas are likely to retain the top position in the global erectile dysfunction drugs market over the forecast period thanks to the presence of several leading players in the global erectile dysfunction drugs market, which has allowed for easy and widespread distribution of a number of erectile dysfunction drugs.

       " 'By Express News Service\\nBENGALURU: As the Covid-19 situation remains grim, the State Government is exploring the possibility of procuring drugs and other equipment from friendly nations.“The need of the hour is to explore possibilities of collaboration in the procurement of drugs, that are needed for critical treatments,” Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister and State Covid Task Force Chairman Dr C N Ashwath Narayan said while addressing a virtual meeting of “Global Innovation Alliance” partner countries, on Monday. The meeting was organised by the state Information Technology and Biotechnology Department.\\nThe DyCM said the state government wants to have sophisticated, multi-speciality hospitals across the state and provide ICUs and other necessary healthcare services even in remote areas. “This is not possible without active global collaboration and partnerships,” he said and added that imposing lockdowns and simultaneously balancing the health, social and economic concerns was a huge challenge.\\nHe explained various measures taken by the government to contain the Covid spread and to treat patients, and emphasised the need for collaboration to fight the pandemic During the interaction, the representatives from Israel, Japan, the USA, UK, Canada, Australia, South Korea, Switzerland, Denmark and other countries spoke about assistance being provided to India to fight the pandemic and shared experiences of Covid management in their countries, said a statement issued by the DyCM’s office.\\nSouth Korean Consul-General in Chennai Kwon Young-seup said they were establishing vaccine manufacturing units to address concerns of vaccine shortage globally.

       " 'euphoria is getting built around unofficial results from the University of Chicago Medicine indicating some relief in Covid-19 symptoms in patients who were given Remdesivir.\\nGiven that the Covid-19 spread has claimed close to 150,000 lives so far—over 33,000 deaths are in the US alone—governments and the masses alike are desperately latching on to any hint of a pharmacological breakthrough. Indeed, the US president, in a White House press briefing in March, had called two antimalarials and an antiviral, Gilead Sciences’s remdesivir, “game-changers”. The US drug regulator then had to put out a statement clarifying that it was adopting a far more cautious outlook, pending rigorous trials. Against such a backdrop, pharma companies are training their focus on research on combatting Covid-19—vaccines, antivirals, even biologics, etc—and, predictably, there has been a rally in the stocks of such companies. Indeed, the Nifty Pharma Index has jumped by 32% between March 16 and April 16.\\nHydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a cheap, generic antimalarial used over many decades, was believed to have some impact on controlling Covid-19—anecdotal evidence, correlations such as low reported incidence in countries with a heavy malarial burden, even trials and studies that weren’t peer-reviewed were used to talk up the drug, resulting in the clamour in policy circles globally to procure these drugs for their population growing manifold.\\nSo much so that the US tried to armtwist India, the world’s largest producer of HCQ, into withdrawing a ban on the drug’s export, while the Brazilian president likened it to sanjibani booti from the Ramayana. But, a spate of studies have questioned the role HCQ can play in the current pandemic. Though there is no conclusive evidence yet to say that HCQ doesn’t work at all, the frenzy around it certainly would have driven up the stocks of the companies making it, which, in turn, would have made people believe more fervently that a cure is in sight.\\nA similar euphoria is getting built around unofficial results from the University of Chicago Medicine indicating some relief in Covid-19 symptoms in patients who were given remdesivir—this was developed by Gilead during the Ebola outbreak, and was tested among patients in Africa to limited success. Perhaps, remdesivir—which interferes with the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the host cell, causing premature termination—can help with Covid-19, but, this must be established through studies that conform to sound testing methods. The UChicago trial, apart from Gilead’s own, is without controls that would help establish the drug’s efficacy with reasonable certainty. As an analysis by equity research concern, Baird, puts it, “randomized, controlled data” could “refute previously ‘encouraging’ data from small, uncontrolled studies”.\\nThe world will have better understanding of remdesivir’s action in late-May, when the US’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases publishes the results of its double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Also, the success, in terms of the low mortality observed in the UChicago sample, could be because of the strict restriction on the kind of cases included in the trial—cases of Covid-19 requiring mechanical breathing support, showing signs of organ failure, etc, were not included.\\nThat said, hopes of a cure will be more well-founded as more research comes out, especially on de novo interventions like the two vaccine candidates already being tested—one in the US, and one in China. India, too, has a stake in all this, with two companies—Serum Institute of India, and Zydus Cadilla—in the vaccine race.',\n",

       " 'This week one the UK’s leading experts on drugs policy, Prof Alex Stevens, resigned from the government’s Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD). His resignation came almost 10 years to the day since I was sacked as the council’s chair.\\nMy “mistake” 10 years ago was to argue that UK drug policy was politically rather than scientifically based. It seems that nothing has changed in the past decade: evidence still takes second place to politics with regard to drug policy decisions. Stevens resigned because the Home Office – the government department in which the ACMD is based – refused to allow the appointment of at least two other experts selected to join the council. It appears their appointments were blocked after political vetting by the Home Office, which discovered some previously declared criticisms of government policies.\\nOne of those blocked is a world expert on drug laws. It seems the justification was her being critical of government\\nWe know one of those blocked to be Niamh Eastwood, the executive director of the charity Release. She is a world expert on drug laws and their impact on individuals and society. As well as being at the forefront of thinking about drug laws, Release has a major educational role in training aspiring drug policy experts from disadvantaged countries around the world. Eastwood is therefore highly suited to the role of a UK drug policy government adviser.\\nIt seems that the justification for blocking her was two Twitter posts critical of government. One accurately, if rather colloquially, challenged a statement made by the then drugs minister, Victoria Atkins, that there was no evidence that safe injecting rooms worked. In fact, there is 30 years worth of international research evidence that they do work. For the drugs minister not to be aware of this evidence either reflects an absurd level of ignorance or a wilful resistance to acknowledge it.\\nThe second tweet related to Windrush, where Eastwood simply expressed the opinion, which most reasonable people share, that the scandal was an outrageous miscarriage of justice. Even the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, made the same point. These two tweets were taken as evidence that she did not meet the standards required to join the ACMD. It is believed the current chair of the council protested about her being debarred and asked for a review of the case. This review has just concluded and supports the Home Office decision – a finding that prompted Stevens to resign in protest.\\nWhen I was sacked in 2009 the Labour government of the time worked with Fiona Fox, head of the Science Media Centre, to review the rules relating to the government’s scientific experts. The guidance concluded that experts should not be dismissed for publicly expressing opinions differing from current government policy. It is time for this principle to be extended to would-be members of expert committees. There are a number of legitimate reasons to turn down a person’s application to join an expert committee. Disagreeing with the government of the day should not be one of them.\\nTo the average citizen it might seem hypocritical that Michael Gove, a self-confessed drugs lawbreaker, sits as one of the most senior cabinet ministers, while a world-renowned expert is denied the opportunity to help develop better drugs policies because she tweeted uncontroversial observations about breaches of trust and competence in government. If ever there was an example of self-serving behaviour by the political elite, this is it.\\nIt is also shortsighted. Drugs research has made great gains since I was dismissed a decade ago. The Home Office, however, has stood still, fighting yesterday’s drugs battles and failing to understand how the world is changing around it. Advances are being made in the fields of medical cannabis and psychedelic research, that have the potential to treat individuals with conditions such as multiple sclerosis and severe depression. With deaths from illegal drugs on the rise, there is also a pressing public health need to pursue policies that reduce harm, rather than promote criminalisation.\\nThe government needs the best possible expert advice to develop effective policies. It needs a strong advisory council with a diverse membership, free from the taint of political interference. Beyond this, it seems to me that it is also time for the UK to act as most other democracies have done and place decision-making on drugs policy in the Department of Health.\\nBy doing so, government policy would have a better chance of being informed by an understanding of evidence. And policy decisions would not be so contaminated by the Home Office, whose blinkered view of drug use as primarily a criminal problem, requiring the criminalisation of drug users, is a tool to court populist authoritarian notions of criminal justice in the electorate. The severe harm this approach causes cannot be overlooked.\\n• David Nutt is professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London. He was chair of the UK’s advisory committee on the misuse of drugs until 2009',\n",

These drugs also yield the same therapeutic effect and are prescribed in the same dosing, with the same quality, and same the way of consumption and usage. However, the inactive ingredients of generic drugs can differ as compared to their branded counter parts. These drugs are mainly marketed after a patent expiry of a branded drug and are significantly lower in costs as compared to the patented branded drugs. Generic drugs are of equivalent quality as compared to the branded drugs and are manufactured under the same safety and manufacturing procedures. Various manufacturers submit an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) to the FDA after the completion of period of patent exclusivity.Request Sample Copy Of This Report: www.coherentmarketinsights.com/insight/request-sample/1132 Patent expiry of branded drugs is a factor expected to boost growth of the global generic drugs marketManufacturers of generic drugs are focusing on development and introduction of various innovative medication and formulation such as biosimilars. According to IMS Health data, generic drugs accounted for over 80% of the prescriptions dispensed in the U.S. in 2013. The number of patents expiring in the near future serves to be a major driver for growth of generic drugs market. For instance, Cetuximab (Erbitux) is an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor that is indicated in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and head and neck cancer. It is manufactured under the patent by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Eli Lily Company in Europe. The drug’s patent expires in 2018 and thus, is expected to provide opportunity for a large number of market players to manufacture its generic version. Furthermore, supportive initiative by FDA to promote development of biosimilars is encouraging manufacturers to focus towards its development. For instance, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act in the U.S. gr ants 12 months patent exclusivity with higher profit margins to the first manufacturer than the conventional generic manufacturers bringing the drugs in market later. Various other factors contributing to growth of generic drugs market include rampant growth in incidence of chronic diseases. However, shortage of active pharmaceutical ingredients leading to unavailability of generics in the market and increasing FDA pressure on manufacturers regarding manufacturing quality of these drugs are hindering the market growth.Market TaxonomyThe global generic drugs market is segmented on the basis of drug type, therapeutic application, route of administration, and region.On the basis of Drug Type, the global generic drugs market is segmented into:Monoclonal Antibodies,Cytokines,Vaccines,Insulin,Peptide Hormones,Immunoglobulin,Peptide Antibiotics,Blood Factors,Others,.On the basis of Therapeutic Application, the global generic drugs market is segmented into:Oncology,Cardiovascular Diseases,Neurology,Infectious Diseases,Musculoskeletal Diseases,Others,.Based on Route of Administration, the global generic drugs market is segmented into:Oral,Topical,Injectable,Intra-venous,Others,.Ask for customization: www.coherentmarketinsights.com/insight/request-customization/113 ..

This is attributed to favorable regulatory policies that are revised and amended to encourage generic drugs business in the region. For instance, Generic Drug User Fee Amendment (GDFUA) was reauthorized in 2017 after its initiation in 2012 by FDA for increasing consumer access to high quality, safe, and affordable drugs. On the other hand, Asia Pacific is expected to show a significant traction in the market over the forecast period. This is attributed to lower manufacturing costs and high skilled workforce in the Asian countries. According to India Brand Equity Foundation, India has the second largest number of U.S. FDA manufacturing plants outside the U.S. that are involved in generic drugs manufacturing. Additionally, the cost of manufacturing is 33% lower in India than that in the U.S., increasing accessibility to generics in these countries.New drug launches and market approvals from the U.S. FDA to generic manufacturers are bolstering growth of the generic drugs market. For instance, in December 2017, Zydus Phamaceuticals — a subsidiary of Cadila Healthcare — received U.S. FDA approval to market Pramipexole Dihydrochloride extended-release tablets for the treatment of Parkinson ’s disease in the U.S. market. Key players operating in the global generic drugs market are Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Mylan N.V., Novartis International AG, Pfizer, Inc., Allergan Plc, Sun Pharmaceuticals, Fresenius Kabi, Sanofi, Endo International, Lupin Ltd., Abbott Healthcare, AstraZeneca Plc, and Novo Nordisk.To know more about the Generic Drugs Market, click the link below, www.coherentmarketinsights.com/ongoing-insight/generic-drugs-mar ..

       " \"A medical worker is taking blood sample for HIV test at Khanh Hoa province's HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Centre. (Photo: khanhhoa.gov.vn)\\n- The Vietnam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control said the country has successfully bidden anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs with prices 15-17 percent lower than those of similar drugs in use, bringing more hopes to local HIV/AIDS patients.Before 2015, ARV drugs often came from drug aid by foreign organisations, including US government-backed President’s Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, as well as support from the Clinton Foundation.Since these organisations have run programmes to provide ARV drugs in large amounts to a lot of countries over a long time, in order to ensure the same quality of drugs for all recipient countries, they would bulk purchase from the producers for a slightly better price.From 2015, overseas funding for HIV/AIDS treatment pills began to drop. To make sure that the supply of ARV drugs would not be interrupted, the Government has tasked the health ministry with using the State budget to purchase ARV drugs. The Administration of HIV/AIDS Control, with the help of international organisations, has managed to negotiate and win bids to buy the drugs in line with World Health Organisation (WHO) standards.In 2016, for the first time ever, the department bought 6.4 million 3-in-1 ARV pills – a single one of these 1200mg pills would contain the three types of medications that patients needed – for the price of 7.299 VND or 0.32 USD (5 percent VAT already included). Vietnam has managed to secure a better deal, buying the pills 16.6 percent cheaper compared with the Global Fund’s purchase price of 0.3681 USD, or 17.8 percent cheaper against the purchase price of PEPFAR’s 0.3728 USD.In 2017, the country procured 3 million 3-in-1 ARV pills at an even lower price, 0.268 USD, 15 percent cheaper compared to 2016 and still lower than the purchase prices from the two abovementioned aid agencies.The HIV/AIDS Control department said that towards the goal of covering 90 percent of HIV/AIDS patients with affordable treatment regimes, the financial sum would be a burden on the State budget.Dr Kato Masaya, Coordinator for Communicable Disease Group at the WHO Vietnam Country Office, said WHO considers Vietnam a highlight in the region in treating HIV/AIDS with ARV, especially its efforts in implementing WHO’s recommendations on diagnostics and maximising coverage of ARV treatment.Currently, there are 130,000 Vietnamese patients under treatment with ARV drugs.According to world experts, in the past decade, the increasingly accessible ARV therapies have helped 150,000 HIV patients escape death and prevent infection in 450,000 people.-VNA\"]"
