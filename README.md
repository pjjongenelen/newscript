# NewScript
Master Thesis Project on template extraction.  

This project aims to evaluate the impact of data quality on the performance of template extraction algorithms.
This is relevant, as the current state of the art is only evaluated on curated benchmark datasets such as the MUC, ACE and Gigaword copora.

We will use the methods as described by:
- Nguyen et al. (2015). Generative Event Schema Induction with Entity Disambiguation
- Weber et al. (2020). Causal Inference of Script Knowledge

The most important python packages that are used for this are NLTK/Wordnet and Stanza (feel free to pronounce the latter in the voice of Petyr Baelish).
