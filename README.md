Master Thesis Project on template extraction.  

This project aims to evaluate the viability of automatic template extraction in the domain of news articles on synthetic drugs.

We will use template extraction methods as described by:
- Chambers & Jurafsky (2011) Template-based information extraction without the templates
- Nguyen et al. (2015). Generative Event Schema Induction with Entity Disambiguation

Currently the project is still very much under development, the current status is:
- Chambers & Jurafsky   Working code in template_extraction.ipynb
- Nguyen et al.         Working (Java) code in folder 'sourcecode', baseline results in two txt files
