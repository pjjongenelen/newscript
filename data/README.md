## MUC-4
We use a version of the MUC-4 dataset provided by Nguyen et al. (2015) as our raw data source. The original MUC-4 data contains many elements that are not usually present in news articles, and Nguyen et al. filtered out precisely this information. For a comparison between the original and the data from Nguyen, see the snippets at the end of this document.
