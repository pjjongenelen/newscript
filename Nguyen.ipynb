The first jury could not reach a verdict, but a second jury convicted him.\\nHowever, that conviction was then successfully appealed in 2017.\\nHe was due for another retrial last year, but on October 22 he entered a guilty plea to the lesser charge, which was accepted by the State.\\nRattigan has been in custody since 2003, and in 2013 was given a 17-year sentence for the sale or supply of drugs from within prison, with a release date with remission in November this year.'"
