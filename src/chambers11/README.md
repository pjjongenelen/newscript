### Template-Based Information Extraction Without the Templates*

----

This folder contains the code to do template extraction according to the methodology as described by Chambers & Jurafsky - henceforth referred to as CJ11.    

The authors describe a three-step process:
1. "Cluster the domains event patterns to approcimate the template topics"  
2. "Build a new corpus _specific to each cluster_ by retrieving documents from a larger unrelated corpus"  
3. "Induce each template's slots using its new (larger) corpus of documents"

(From the first paragraph of section 4, pp. 978)  
The implementation of these steps is in [``` 1_template_topics.py ```](1_template_topics.py), [``` 2_build_corpus.py ```](2_build_corpus.py), [``` 3_template_slots.py ```](3_template_slots.py) respectively.
