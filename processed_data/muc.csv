The Salvadoran Air Force maintains the same operational level it has had for the last 10 years, despite the removal of its top commander, Jaun Rafael Bustillos, this week . Paratrooper Battalion commander major Rene Rodriguez Hurtado said today that the Air force will continue to obey the orders of the general staff and to maintain a similar operational level .``We know general Villamariona enough to know that we will continue with our Battalion's attacks on all the terrorist criminals' Redoubts . We depend directly on the general staff, since it is the strategic head of the entire Army . The general staff gives us our orders to launch our operations .""major Rodriguez Hurtado today denied that Salvadoran Air Force planes had entered Nicaraguan territory as the Sandinist government said last week . Maj Rodriguez Hurtado said that Salvadoran Air Force planes have never entered the neighboring Teritory of Nicaragua .``I can tell you that those were neither Salvadoran nor Honduran planes . In my opinion, the Sandinists want to invent an excuse to continue helping the Fmln . ours and the Honduran planes are small planes . I do not think that Honduran planes entered Nicaraguan territory . those Communists are trying to invent an excuse to continue helping the Fmln terrorist criminals .""Maj. Rodriguez made these statements during the presentation of a number of weapons confiscated by the paratroopers Battalion on 4 January .``here we have 12 rifles , 11 Ar-15 rifles and 1 Ak-47 rifle; 4,000 cartridges, of which 2,000 are for M-16 machine guns and 2,000 for Ak-47 rifles; 36 cartridges of an unknown caliber--military intelligence has already been informed of this discovery; and I radio of the type used by the leaders of the terrorist groups .""the weapons were found at El Nispero Creek near the Sacamil neighborhood .

According to retired General Fernando Torres Silva, who is the Army judge advocate general, the modifications establish lighter sentences, freedom on bail, and possible Pardons or Amnesties . These benefits were not contemplated under the former Antiterrorist law . as an example Torres cited that``sentences of individuals tried as accomplices will be lower . They will receive lower sentences than that previously contemplated .""the new bill will also allow a great number of people who are being tried by the Interior Ministry to go out on bail .

3,DEV-MUC3-0004,CLANDESTINE,1990-01-08,"Goodbye general Rafael Bustillo, false hope for mass killers . Gen. Bustillo resigns or is made to resign as the Air Force chief . because of this, the general is admitting that without the bombing on San Salvador's neighborhoods the Fmln would have defeated the Salvadoran armed forces . Bustillo's resignation is yet another sign of the failure of 10 years of the U.S. Counterinsurgency policy in El Salvador, as became clear with the offensive launched on 10 November . for 10 years the military and their U.S. sponsors based their trust in the air power to drown in blood the aspiration of the nation to achieve democracy and social justice . This first happened in the interior of the country, with the destruction of dozens of towns like Tenancingo, Berlin, Torola, San Fernando, and so many others that took place along with the genocide carried out by the infantry with the mass murders of civilians in El Mosoto, Sunpul, and Ocotapayo . Bustillo is leaving as so many generals and U.S . ambassadors have . and like all of them his departure reveals the imperialist power's failure to consolidate its Counterinsurgency program in El Salvador . As all the others who have left, Bustillo also SEEKS excuses in the face of his failure, by accusing others . He accuses Vides Casanova of being soft in fighting the people's plan . One would have to ask Bustillo if the Air Force, of which he represented its most encouraging pillar, was soft when it murdered 70,000 Salvadorans, Monsignor Arnulfo Romero and the Jesuit priests included, and even when it murdered Patriot officers of that same Army . was the U.S. Pentagon soft when it gave $3 billion, weapons, and bombs for the most cowardly act of genocide Latin America can recall this century? the U.S. strategy, implemented through the top military command in the past 10 years with all its might did all it could so that the permanent rebellion in the rural areas reached the country's vital centers, as indeed happened as of the 10 November offensive . Bustillo States it clearly . The bombing temporarily halted the defeat of the top command . through an act of genocide, it managed to remove the disgruntled people from the neighborhoods where the guerrilla forces were . Bustillo acknowledges genocide is the sole way the armed forces can survive . Bustillo acknowledges the Fmln's strength and therefore urges the armed forces to be tougher and inflexible and rejects a political solution to the conflict . a political solution would express the consensus among the country's major sectors . Obviously the top command represents a decadent minority . Bustillo supports launching a Fascist crusade against the people's wish for democracy . In this effort, he lashes out at the Catholic Church, all opposition sectors that report human rights violations, and all sectors that support Democratizing the country . In conclusion, we say that Bustillo is not resigning of his own volition . The Fmln action eliminated Bustillo as it eliminated Garcia, Vides, and so many other military chiefs who left their posts without fulfilling the task commissioned by the United States: to stop the Fmln . The Fmln offensive Bared the Genocidal, Antipopular, and Fascist nature of the Alfredo Cristiani regime to such an extent that it prompted a strong debate in the United States on cutting military aid . The Jesuits' murders and the bombings so shook the international community that it is pressuring for punishment of the officers involved in these incidents . However, the Bush administration accepted this, since Colonel Rene Emilio Ponce and his clique, even Cristiani, must shoulder this responsibility . We must not forget that in Costa Rica the Salvadoran defense Minister disclosed Cristiani authorized the bombings . Bush needed a scapegoat to place it on the altar of the debates which will begin in the U.S. Congress on the fate of military aid . Bustillo is Bush's scapegoat . However, Bustillo was already a useless element of the murderous machinery that remains active . will the U.S. public and Congress be appeased with this foul tasting candy? time and the spirit of the times are obviously running against the Fascist program in El Salvador . While peoples of the world tear down dogmas, Dictatorships, and walls, Bustillo, who leaves through the door of defeat, asks the armed forces to be tougher, commit more genocide, and build more walls of repression against the church, the people, and the nation as a whole . goodbye, Gen. Bustillo . We continue writing history without you . The decade we begin is of democracy, independence, and self-determination . that is why foreign intervention and the walls of intolerance have a short life span in this country, where the people grow in heroism and the struggle for social change is not deterred by bombings."

5,DEV-MUC3-0006,SAN SALVADOR,1990-01-09,"The Salvadoran Army today prevented the occupation of cities in the Eastern part of El Salvador, waging strong clashes between midnight and dawn, according to reports by military sources . The attacks, according to the reports, took place in Usulutan, Usulutan Department , 110 km east of the capital, and in Santa Elena where as of 0700 clashes were still under way . Santa Elena is located 119 km east of the capital, and both cities are coffee regions . In Usulutan , 6th Brigade troops and rapid deployment battalions repelled the incursion with artillery fire . During the 2d week of December, there had been strong clashes on the outskirts of Usulutan, in what the guerrillas called the``battle of El Nisperal ,""in the Canton that bears the same name, which cost the Army 29 dead, although it has only admitted to 21 deaths . In Santa Elena the clashes were also strong, but so far there have been no reports of casualties on either side . from San Vicente, in the central part of the country, where the Chichontepec volcano is located, strong clashes were reported, and the 5th Brigade bombed rebel positions on the Colcano, where the Fmln has strong Bastions . The 1ST infantry Brigade is carrying out operations in northern San Salvador . and on the outskirts of the capital this morning powerful explosions, characterized as military actions to prevent rebels from gathering, could be heard . The night before last, there were attempts to enter the capital from that direction . The Army has increased its surveillance to prevent Mobilizations, and through careful searches vehicles are being controlled at the capital city's Entrances and exits . In other actions, the armed forces press committee reported at least six Fmln deaths in various parts of the country . last night there were fewer attacks on stores and electric towers in the capital . There were also threats of power rationing if these actions continued."
6,DEV-MUC3-0007,SANTIAGO,1990-01-09,"The deployment of U.S . ships, including the aircraft carrier``John F. Kennedy""and the Corvette``Virginia""along the Colombian Coast yesterday, seeking to intercept drug trafficking routes, could be the result of three policies: first, that the United States needs to justify the invasion of Panama under the excuse of its fight against drug trafficking . Second, that both the deployment of ships and the invasion of Panama are part of a serious military plan to end the drug plague . Third, that the United States must somehow justify the invasion of Panama and the need to recover its international image has provided a real opportunity to put an end to drug trafficking . If the objective really is to eliminate drugs, then the battle is Praiseworthy, but--like in Panama--the procedure is painful, overbearing, imperialistic, and humiliating . Instead of winning the Latin American countries' appreciation and solidarity with this Laudable cause, the United States is again provoking angry reactions and deep distrust . the side effects of this action could be very negative for the struggle against drug trafficking, in which all the countries of this continent should be cooperating . alternatively, would it be better if they did not cooperate in this phase? could it be that what we have called imperialistic Clumsiness, Insensibility, and abuse, is simply a deliberate strategy with which, perhaps for well founded reasons and even at the risk of diplomatic conflicts, the United States seeks to isolate Latin America on purpose and thus ensure the success of its operation? If this were the case then we must ask, why? from its operations in Panama and Colombia, the United States is telling us that it is not concerned with the diplomatic aspect for the time being . The United States wants action and efficiency . The United States is losing its patience, and perhaps its confidence in the seriousness and capability of Latin America to face this war . If the action in Colombia goes further than a mere surveillance, the United States will be establishing a precedent in this battle against drug trafficking . This means that during a first phase the United States will carry out a military operation by itself . during a second phase it will discuss secondary subjects but with less urgency in the war against drug trafficking . next 15 February, Bush will meet in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, with his Colombian, Peruvian, and Bolivian counterparts . Perhaps on that occasion they will talk about the other aspects of this war: the reorganization of the local economies to end the dependency on Coca Plantations, the recovery of drug addicts, and the consolidation of governments, etc . During this current phase, however, the United States wishes to act alone . who knows if it is because of Latin America's lack of understanding? as we said a few days ago, the drug trafficking problem is creating new situations in international relations . The U.S. proposal is probably something like: could a world power like the United States continue to ignore a serious problem like the production, distribution, and consumption of drugs, merely to avoid harming Latin American sensibilities, sensibilities of countries whose governments are always Muddled up in useless diplomatic and bureaucratic procedures and fruitless negotiations? and all this while a large part of the developed world's population is becoming addicted to a deadly product? the United States could also be asking itself: have the Latin American governments been able to solve this serious problem by themselves? can those governments stop drug trafficking when it is known that drugs and corruption go hand in hand; when in the past and perhaps in the present, high ranking government officials have been linked with this illegal trade and protecting the Medellin cartel Chiefs? Why, for example, after all this hasn't the Colombian government managed to Extradite the main Chiefs of that cartel to the United States? let us recall the horrible explosion of the Colombian airliner, in which more than 100 people died; the bomb explosion in the secret police headquarters in Bogota; the murder of many journalists who were engaged in an heroic war against drug trafficking; and mainly, let us recall the ever-present difficulties that must be faced when the Medellin cartel Chiefs must be punished and Extradited."

9,DEV-MUC3-0010,LIMA,1990-01-09,"President Alan Garcia has confirmed that the U.S . troops that surrounded our diplomatic mission in Panama were withdrawn after a former Minister Surnamed Cordova left the embassy . The military man, who is involved in a murder trial, left the Peruvian embassy as soon as he learned that the embassy considered him persona non grata . I think journalists have magnified the issue a bit . As far as we know, people sought protection .... someone arrives at the door of the embassy and asks for refuge in view of a situation of force . The situation in Panama is abnormal; it has been totally invaded by 30,000 soldiers . Some persons entered the embassy . at least one of them had been allegedly linked with the death of a Panamanian Minister, a Mr Spadafora, who was murdered . The authorities of the embassy and of the foreign Ministry stated that this person's presence was undesirable . We do not refuse to grant refuge--a condition that is granted before granting political Asylum--to Whomever feels harassed or Mistreated . in a case like this, however, in which there was an alleged involvement in a murder which was committed years ago, this person--I believe he is a man Surnamed Cordova, apparently a Highranking Panamanian guard officer--was told that his presence was not wanted . He left the embassy of his own will . There are other Panamanian defense forces officers at the embassy, including Mr Noriega's Secretary, but their status should be established by Peru . An incident was reported yesterday, as the U.S . troops surrounded the embassy, deploying barriers and barbed wire . There was an attempt to depict a dramatic and spectacular picture of a siege or perhaps of an invasion of the embassy .

Monsignor Gregorio Rosa Chavez today stated that the Catholic Church is pleased with the progress of the investigations regarding the murder of the Jesuit priests . He said that if the soldiers involved in the killing are punished, the government will not only earn International prestige, but will lay the groundwork to consolidate the administration of justice in El Salvador . Rosa Chavez said that if the killing is solved, the period of impunity that has tarnished the judicial system and covered up a number of crimes to which justice has not been applied will end . It seems that the President should be recognized for having had the courage to keep his promise to conduct a thorough investigation . We understand that he has not yet revealed the details of this crime but that he will do so soon . However, I want to say something that has not been said: the church is not interested in learning who the murderers are just for the truth to come out . the church wants this punishment to mean that impunity has ended in El Salvador; that the poor will feel certain that justice will prevail for them; that so many crimes that have been forgotten will be solved little by little; but mainly, that from now on, crimes will no longer go unsolved . Msgr Rosa Chavez added that the tone of verbal violence must be lowered since this only results in a useless confrontation and promotes a polarization of the conflict, as well as hinders any effort to apply justice . He said that the verbal war is as harmful as irrational violence . He said that irresponsible charges and accusations continue in the country, and they do not help strengthen the peace process . It is important to overcome verbal violence . This means that a calm climate, a climate that is as impartial as possible, must be sought to discuss issues . We recall that last year, many violent statements were made . Many harsh expressions were uttered . too many heated statements printed in some newspapers . The language used is too harsh . I think that to obtain justice, we need a calmer climate . He added that a climate of serenity and respect would facilitate the right conditions for a dialogue that would guarantee mechanisms to reconcile our society . He urged the government and the judicial authorities to continue making progress in the review of the judicial system to reorganize it in a way that will allow the honest Adminstration of justice to do away with impunity."

The Fmln and several sectors, including young armed forces officers, were right in pointing to the Army as being responsible for this horrible crime . The responsibility of the armed institution for this case and the cases involving Fenastras, Monsignor Romero, the nuns, and the U.S. agrarian experts, as well as for the bombings in the cities and Massacres in the rural sector, show that we were right when we mentioned in our last peace proposal the need to clean up the Army and reform the judicial system . 2 . to advance in the country's democratization, it is not enough to solve this case . The other cases need to be solved and those guilty for them should be punished . The establishment of responsibilities cannot remain at the level of officers and troops who only carried out orders . most important is to establish responsibility among Higher-Ranking officers because a decision of this sort could not be beyond the responsibility of the top command . 3 . It is also necessary to comply with the Esquipulas II agreements concerning democratization; reforming the judicial system; lifting the state of emergency; reestablishing freedom of expression, mobilization, and organization; releasing the more than 3,000 political prisoners; and stopping the repression against the church and other sectors . 4 . The announcement by Cristiani is an effort to resolve complicated discussions on U.S. aid for El Salvador and to continue to benefit from this aid to maintain the war . It would be a mistake to increase aid to the Salvadoran Army because of this announcement or because the case may be resolved . Such aid would leave open the possibility of seeing a case like that of the Jesuit priests happening again . The best way to contribute to a negotiated solution is to cease aid . We appeal to the U.S. Congress to make this decision . If this is done, the Fmln would commit itself to making efforts to reach an immediate ceasefire . 5 . favorable conditions for negotiations depend on Justice-Making progress . If the Army is thoroughly purged because of this case, peace could be reached earlier . 6 . to contribute toward a prompt peace, we will ask the office of the UN Secretary General to Mediate . We urge the government to jointly meet with us and with Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar within the next 30 days to renew the Dialogue-Negotiation process . 7 . The Fmln will be watching how the situation develops . It URGES national and international forces to exert pressure so that the investigation process does not end with a declaration of intention or with statements blaming Low-Ranking soldiers to protect those who are most responsible .

What is your opinion in this regard? the fact that President Cristiani acknowledges that members of the Army were responsible for the massacre is a first step and definitely a good thing, but it is entirely insufficient unless the subsequent steps are also taken . First, to identify who the responsible parties were: This is the first important point, because nobody can feel satisfied if only Low-Ranking officers are identified . such an act can only have been ordered by High-Ranking officers . We must not forget the murder of Monsignor Romero, for which there were no sentences and no trials . However, the armed forces high command immediately denied involvement in the operation, stating that it was an isolated action``divorced from any institutional policy .""I believe this is entirely wrong: the murder of the Jesuit fathers cannot be considered an isolated action . over 7,000 people have died in El Salvador during 10 years of civil war, and 90 percent of them were civilians . political assassination by the government forces is a constant practice . Furthermore, torture is regularly practised in El Salvador . The Army high command cannot fail to know this . they cannot claim to be innocent, because they have the greatest responsibilities for human rights violations . Yet last month the summit of central American heads of state in San Jose ended with a success for President Cristiani, who secured an explicit condemnation of the offensive launched by the guerrillas in November, whereas no specific charges were leveled at the government for human rights violations . There is a positive factor that should be borne in mind, namely, the call from the five Presidents for a resumption of the dialogue in El Salvador and the appeal to the UN Secretary General to carry out mediation to this end . But in the summit's final document, it is the Fmln and the Nicaraguan Contras who pay the price for the agreement among the Presidents: these are diplomatic games that do not facilitate the restoration of peace in Central America . What paths can be taken now to advance the negotiations? negotiations are becoming increasingly necessary . The guerrilla offensive shows that the Fmln is a strong military force, but also that a revolutionary attitude does not exist among the masses . It also shows that the government army, after 10 years of U.S. training, is an Army whose military stance is defensive, not offensive while this all shows that there can only be a negotiated solution to the crisis, it is also true that precisely following the guerrilla offensive the Army stiffened its stance against negotiations . I believe that sooner or later common sense will prevail and it will sit down at the negotiating table . at the end of November the U.S. Secretary of state's assistant for Latin America spoke officially for the first time about the need for negotiations to resolve the crisis in El Salvador: This is an important sign of a changing situation."

Merino said that the Fmln should not claim credit for the resumption of a dialogue because it was President Alfredo Cristiani who took the initiative in resuming the talks . Merino added that the rebels should abandon the delaying and irresponsible tactics regarding the dialogue because the Fmln has lost credibility both in the military sense and in international politics . The Fmln has lost credibility in all of its activities, including military actions . The only valid alternative to pacify the country is for the rebels to stop hostilities, violence, and terrorism . We should jointly explore the possibilities of their joining the democratic process . He also said one of the alternatives readily available to the Fmln is to participate in the elections for delegates to the central American Parliament . El Salvador has proposed at the legislative Assembly to ratify the central American Parliament protocol . This would open the door for the special election of the Salvadoran delegates to the Parliament . If a truly Democratic willingness by the Fmln exists, this could be their first opportunity to participate . It has not yet been decided whether this election will be held before the 1991 official elections for mayors and deputies . The government and the Fmln could jointly consider the advantages of a special election this year . Then we could make preparations for the 1991 constitutional elections . regarding the Fmln military actions, Merino said the government is familiar with the rebels' tactics, particularly when talks are being considered . He also said the rebels operate in cycles . The government has never reacted naively to the Fmln terrorists' statements or their participation in the dialogue . We are fully aware of their plans and strategies . The government, however, bears the primary responsibility of seeking harmony and the citizens's security . after the rebels' Counteroffensive in November, which was regarded as the largest military operation in the past 10 years, the possibility for a new dialogue has appeared in El Salvador once more, creating expectations, both here and abroad . the coming meeting of President Cristiani with United nation's representatives, scheduled for next week, and the meeting on 12 January of a rebel delegation with a United Nations official seem to indicate that talks will be held shortly."

28,DEV-MUC3-0029,CLANDESTINE,1990-01-12,"The U.S . Congressmen's Worktables are filled with surprises . They are to renew their sessions in 2 weeks' time, and important matters are waiting to be discussed . after the Fmln started its 11 November offensive which buried the Army's propagandistic claims that it had finished off the guerrillas, along came the great surprises in the East European countries, when they brought down walls without having to resort to military invasions and attained a Democratic opening . ending the year, the world was surprised with the brutal U.S . invasion of Panama . Now, when the last decade of the century is about to begin, El Salvador adds another page to the book of last-minute surprises . Alfredo Cristiani himself--who, together with armed forces officers, said hours after the Jesuits and their maids had been murdered that there were suspicions that the Fmln could be involved in the massacre--has just accepted, especially for the benefit of the U.S. Congress, that armed forces personnel were the ones who murdered the top brains, the best intellectuals of El Salvador . The murderers were military personnel, and, at least on the National televison network, Cristiani promised to Dislose their names ....the Jesuits' murders or the cancellation of aid . If it is true that the Army--which murdered Monsigno Oscar Romero , 1,000 peasants in El Mozote , 70 Indians in Las Hojas, hundreds of Salvadorans in Zunpu, and unionists at the Fenastras offices, along with the rest of the armed forces' well-known crimes--is going to be purged at last, if this is really true, then we would have to say that a true negotiation will start . in the past, the Fmln has made proposals for negotiations to end the war . one of our demands, a realistic demand to propitiate peace in El Salvador, is undoubtedly the purge of the Army . In Mexcio and in San Jose, Costa Rica, we said that if the government did not accept the Fmln's proposal, the nation would do so . and that is what has happened . the nation demands that the armed forces be purged . The most important U.S. newspapers and Newscasts have noted the Irrefutable fact that 10 years of U.S . advice and an investment of more than $3 billion--very close to $4 billion--to create a huge buildup in their armaments have not served to change the mentality of an Army that murdered Monsignor Romero and thousands of civilians, including nuns and U.S. advisers . We believe Democratic Senator Christopher Dodd was mistaken when he said that U.S. aid in itself was not being discussed . The 10 years of aid, advice, and U.S. strategy in El Salvador have proven to be a failure . If the United States has any intentions of contributing to peace, now is the time to change its policy toward El Salvador . events have placed the issue of the continuation of aid to El Salvador on the Congressmen's Worktables . The aid was made conditional on punishment for the Jesuits' murders . But what is the order of the day? it is a decision that goes beyond a basic demand for justice . It will determine the continuation of U.S. aid . It entails the decision to turn their policy around to contribute to a political solution in El Salvador . They are to discuss whether Congress' position is to be: one, we approve the purge of the Army and thus we will give them more aid, or, two, we approve the purge as a concrete step to democratization and will suspend military aid so that these conditions can be used to reach a negotiated political solution . will U.S . Congressmen be capable of surprising the world by helping the Salvadorans to topple the Fascist wall, the wall of war? will they do this by stopping military aid? the Fmln has said clearly that if the United States stops aid to the Army it will correspond with actions to reach a complete halt in hostilities . We hope the U.S. Congress does not make a mistake . If it stops aid, if it cuts it, if it ends it, we will stand before a clear and hopeful sign for peace . However, if not, we will stand before yet another sign of war, and the surprise will not be a good one."

The links between D'Aubuisson's arena party and the Guatemalan National liberation movement of Mario Sandoval are well known . Both oppose every effort to bring peace to the region . 2 . This new crime and the recent events concerning the case of the Jesuits, which show that the Masterminds will not be punished, forces us to review our dialogue offer because we are not interested in helping the Fascist regime wash its face to obtain U.S. military aid and to proceed with its plan to annihilate every type of opposition . 3 . The assassination of Dr Oqueli and his companion, Gilda Flores, the extension of the state of the siege, and the fact that nothing indicates that there will be punishment for the Masterminds of the massacre of 16 November show that Cristiani's announcement to get to the bottom of the latter case is only a farce to obtain U.S. aid and to proceed with the slaughter of opposition members . 4 . as those events show, the political solution to the Confict requires a purge of the armed forces, democratization, and self-determination . There can be no dialogue amid state terrorism, a state of siege, and general trampling on human rights . Under the state of siege, the regime gives itself the right to carry out a general repression . Therefore, we call on all political and social forces to struggle for its Abrogation . 5 .

33,DEV-MUC3-0034,CLANDESTINE,1990-01-13,"What we had predicted has occurred . Cristiani announced this afternoon that a Colonel, two lieutenants, one second lieutenant, two second sergeants, and two soldiers were involved in the massacre of the Jesuits . The accusation against Colonel Benavides is the following: that the multiple crime was committed in the sector under his command . from the lieutenant on down, the accusation is that they directly participated in the crime ., as Cristiani said, that it was Col Benavides, but it was not Col Benavides who issued the order . So, the question is: who gave the order to kill the Jesuits and their two maids . in our view, Col Benavides was implicated solely as a means of propaganda aimed at the U.S. Congress . It is clear that Col Benavides did not give the order . He probably did not even know about the action . This is consistent with what we know about his background . First, he is not known to have carried out acts of repression or corruption . Our report indicates that Benavides has maintained a position in favor of institutions and open to discussions . He was described as an active, studious and not repressive cadet, one of the few exceptions in La Tandona . In other words, for the La Tandona, a gang of assassins, he is a perfect scapegoat . The massacre of the Jesuits was not a personal decision . It was part of the armed forces' Counteroffensive actions during the November battles . It was a cold-blooded, Premeditated plan executed to Decapitate the people's movement and the Democratic opposition . Let us remember the threats against father Ellacuria over the National radio network prior to the assassination . Let us remember that between the night of 15 November and early morning of 16 November, several offices of labor unions and houses of opposition members were attacked . Let us remember that after the Masssacre of the Jesuits, the officers shouted over loudspeakers that they had killed Ellacuria and that they were going to continue killing Communists . The Bishop of San Salvador was a witness to this . in our view, the assassins of the Jesuits were those who appeared on the radio and television network making known the results of the so-called honor Commission . Col Benavides will probably be freed in a short time and be appointed to some post abroad, or he might experience the same fate as that of Captain Eduardo Alfonso Avila, who went in and out of jail each time that military aid for El Salvador was discussed in the U.S. Congress . However, in any case and as has always occurred, it will be the lieutenants, the noncommissioned officers, and the soldiers who carried out an order who will pay the consequences . We have already seen this happen in the cases of the nuns when a few soldiers, the massacre of San Francisco, and the assassination of the U.S. advisers and Rodolfo Viera . Once again the people's hopes are frustrated, as has happened in so many other cases . The assassination of the Jesuits again CONFIRMS that to, as Cristiani said, get to the bottom of this, we have to obtain democracy, justice, and self-determination."

The only way left is to continue the struggle, and thus we would have to intensify this struggle in the political and military field . Then, unfailingly, if there is no political solution, there will be a social explosion in the country . It is Unstoppable .

44,DEV-MUC3-0045,TEGUCIGALPA,1989-01-26,"... which has dismayed all Honduran people . The government strongly condemns this kind of action--the murder of General Gustavo Alvarez Martinez--which was politically motivated and perpetrated by professionals, and which, I believe, deserves the denunciation of all Hondurans . Mr President, will the three branches of government and the armed forces adopt additional security measures? Yes, we will be discussing that soon . I have a meeting scheduled with the national security Council, which will also be attended by the three Presidents of the state branches . I mean, the will chair the meeting, and national Congress President Carlos Arbin Montoya and Supreme Court President Salomon Jimenez Castro will also attend . We have also invited the candidates of the two parties to this meeting since one of them is going to be the next Honduran President . We plan to establish some guideline--some rules to be followed--not just for the remainder of our term but in the future as well, because we should be farsighted and not just concentrate on the short term, which has been very common in Honduras, where we look and find solutions only for the present . We should find solutions jointly in the long run, which includes the issue of violence . We believe in a democracy like ours, which is a very complete democracy . In other words, there are internal elections for selecting candidates, where citizens enjoy full rights, where parties and party leaders consult with the people, where we have true, clean, and honest elections, where we have a national electoral Commission that is not influenced by nor can it be influenced by the government, and where the state branches are totally independent . all of these characteristics make Honduras a democracy, and every sector of Honduran society should strive to strengthen them by avoiding violence at all costs, obeying the law, and condemning and attacking extreme terrorist groups regardless of their affiliation, thus enabling us to consolidate our democracy and reach the level of political development attained by other Democratic countries . It has been demonstrated worldwide that progress and development can only be achieved through democracy . The Frg, the Mediterranean countries--Italy, France, and Spain--are examples of this, and there is the case of Japan, which has a liberal democratic system and has achieved extraordinary levels of development . Taiwan is yet another example . at this stage...yes, but this takes time . Yes . at this stage I believe there is sufficient proof that the democratic system is the best means of attaining higher levels of development . There is no doubt in anyone's mind about that, but the fact that we have this system is not enough . each one of us, each sector, must do his part to make it work . When I mention sectors, I am referring to private enterprise, which must be generous, exhibit confidence in the country, and show much initiative; to organized labor groups, which must fight for their rights without Fomenting strikes and other disorders, which are sometimes brought about illegally instead of following the normal legal procedures; to professional associations, which also have an enormous responsibility, because their members must comply with their duties; and the same goes for government employees and others . In other words, this will not be accomplished by this or the next government alone . Our governments are transitory and their power is relative . I have said this many times . There is no point in lashing out at the President, because power in Honduras is relative and conditional . What is essential is to contribute positively toward Honduras' development . This should be a responsibility not only of public employees, businessmen, workers, and organized peasants, but all Hondurans should contribute . that is what counts . Mr President, when will this meeting be held and what immediate measures will you propose? the appropriate authorities are doing everything possible to investigate the latest crime, which was not an everyday occurrence like a robbery or something of that nature . This crime was carefully planned . It was a terrorist act perpetrated by professionals . Mr President, some people have been saying that the death penalty might be a way to cope with the situation . What do you think about this? I recently read something about the death penalty in a Mexican magazine . The death penalty is opposed by a majority of the people and has been abolished in Honduras . I do not think this is the solution here because the death penalty has not solved the crime problem anywhere else in the world . for instance, this penalty exists in many U.S. States, but this has not deterred criminals from committing terrible crimes . people have lost control . When criminals have no respect for their fellow man, not even the death penalty can stop them . However, there are crimes, such as drug trafficking, for which no bail should be permitted . I think a bill that has been proposed by the Supreme Court of justice should be passed by the Congress . of course, it will be approved by the President so those found guilty of this crime cannot be bailed out . It is not right for the authorities to arrest a drug Trafficker only to see him released on bail by a judge who has no other choice than to abide by the law . Mr President, the far rightist group AAA, through a local radio station, warned that they will take revenge on major Communist leaders, such as Jorge Arturo Reina, Ramon Custodio, and others . What do you have to say about this? I am adamantly opposed to this type of revenge because it would only lead to escalated confrontations between groups . I condemn this attitude in view of the regrettable murder of General Gustavo Alvarez Martinez . As far as the death penalty goes, it will not be a solution to the crime problem . Mr President, civic committees have to be organized in the country . I agree, but these committees should be controlled by the authorities . A civic committee to protect communities is one thing, but it is quite another thing to sue these committees to perform duties that are already the responsibility of state agencies, such as the armed forces . When will the government branches meet? they will meet when I return from Caracas."

The up announced in early March that it would not participate in the Roundtables, the name given to the talks that will begin next Monday and in which the participants will discuss the large number of political crimes that have been perpetrated by rightist paramilitary groups . Since the up was founded, nearly 1,000 of its members and leaders have been murdered .

The Presidents received firsthand information on the peace plan and on the results the government expects from this process . I believe we have received great support for the peace process . as a country, El Salvador has received the Latin American Presidents' support for the peace process, especially the support of the South American Presidents with whom we had not had an opportunity to hold bilateral talks . regarding the coffee problem, Cristiani said the Presidents noted the need for reaching agreements on the coffee pact and the price of coffee . He added that during the Presidential summit he condemned, in the presence of all Presidents, the aid Nicaragua gives to the Fmln . However, there was no response from the Sandinist government, Cristiani stated . concerning the recent attacks blamed on the guerrillas, particularly the 30 October attack on the Army's high command, Cristiani said this is regrettable because civilians are more affected by such attacks . This incident takes place at a time when the Fmln is trying to show its strength . The Fmln is also trying to provoke some reaction from the armed forces so that the Army, in a given moment, exerts pressure to suspend the dialogue process . I think this is the reason for their attitude . Cristiani added that such attitudes will not hinder the dialogue process in Venezuela .

103,DEV-MUC3-0104,CLANDESTINE,1989-11-02,"Comrade Sancho, why has the Fmln decided not to attend the Caracas meeting? the Fmln general command instructed me this afternoon to announce to the nation a communique in which we decided not to attend the Caracas meeting and dialogue . The reason for this is the recent Fenastras massacre, which we believe cannot be ignored . This is not just another attack, like the ones we are used to, but an attack that signals a new political era similar to those when an electoral massacre occurred, when Msgr Arnulfo Romero was murdered, when other crimes marked new steps in the new Fascist escalation of the dictatorship now led by Alfredo Cristiani, Colonel Rene Emilio Ponce, and the great executioner and perpetrator of Massacres, Elena Fuentes . The main thing is that the Fascist military dictatorship, headed by a small armed forces group, has been exposed . We do not think this can be ignored . The state and have to pay a political price . This price is Col Ponce's resignation, which is now demanded by the people's movement . after the attack, instead of seeking a detente, the Army, on the contrary, continued its Provocations . for instance, several plainclothes members of the 1ST infantry Brigade Fenastras and the popular movement took them prisoner . more than 30 of them were detained . We learned this afternoon that the police released a communique saying they would station Antiriot policemen at the National cemetery . We also heard Col Mauricio Vargas saying that, if the dialogue door is closed, it has to be kicked open . What do you think of the situation after the cowardly attack on Fenastras? We think all these activities of the death squads, the 1ST infantry Brigade, the police, and the National Guard are only the open expression of the armed forces' position, which is to plan a full-scale confrontation with the popular movement . We think this indicates behind the backs of the majority of armed forces members . It is a minority who have decided on these Provocations against the popular movement . This movement, however, is sufficiently strong to disarm these provocateurs, present them to the press, and hand them over to show that the people express their tremendous power whenever they want . With La Tandona in power, and with the situation the arena era has ushered in, is there no possible solution through dialogue? What other alternative do you have? I believe that it is quite clear that President Cristiani and the high command are practically doing away with political opportunities, as our earlier communique issued after the Fenastras attack indicates . the end result is that since there is no political framework within which to establish a political game with certain political rules for the opposition and state forces, our only other alternative is to immediately take up our weapons, because there is no other way of guaranteeing the survival of the popular movement and the nation . The people's legitimate right to defense is becoming increasingly legitimate, and it is gaining greater national and international recognition . The popular movement is once again facing a decisive moment in the country's history, and the workers are giving their share of blood in this struggle . What message would you send to the popular movement, especially to the comrade workers at Fenastras? on this occasion, I wish to send a special message to Fenastras . I must tell them to continue to be inspired by the purest concepts of the popular struggle, to keep their inspiration, to be creative and cool, and that when people begin to create their own history, they are truly invincible . I believe that Fenastras has the people's full support and that it will gradually gain even more support . Fenastras must continue--as its leaders say--on the Warpath . In reality, the cost in lives of leaders such as Febe Elizabeth and all the others who were killed, as well as those killed in the past, is quite high . The cost is political . It has taken lives but this, in reality, strengthens the organization . The people's response has been one of anger and discontent, and this discontent will eventually turn into a clamor for armed struggle by sectors that really and to achieve our people's freedom."

In practice, the objective is to establish a land corridor between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans--an old project of the Brazilian military Geostrategists . The Brazilian military ministers supported Sarney's position by announcing that they will not accept``any type of foreign foreign interference in the Amazon region""and that they rejected as``unacceptable""the attempts to link the foreign debt with investments to preserve the Amazon forest . Garcia indicated that if the United States wants to help preserve the ecological balance, it should``speed up disarmament talks with the Soviet Union .""he added that``the best way to protect the Amazon region is to eliminate deadly weapons and nuclear bombs .""Garcia then reiterated:``I do not believe that President Bush has said that, but if he said it, I believe that it is a serious matter and he should give us a concrete opinion .""Garcia defended relations with Brazil by saying:``I believe Fortifying economic, social, and geographic relations between the two countries is a national objective .""then he added:``Brazil is one of the world's most important countries, and Peru has wrongly lived in fear of Brazil . Let us hope that not one but five highways are built through the Amazon region .""sixty percent of Peru's 1.3 million square kilometers lie in the Amazon region . that makes up nearly one-fifth of the entire Amazon Basin."

It seems that the entire penal code has fallen upon me, while my opponents are completely ignored . regarding the rest of the letter, it does not even deserve mentioning because such a letter does not exist .

De La Sotta stated that this is an example of the damage that terrorism can cause . You can see and measure the scope of a terrorist act such as the one we have just experienced, the sole objective of which is to cause harm . This can be demonstrated by the advertisement, not a clear and concrete advertisement, but an anonymous telephone call by which they warned us, that is, they warned the embassies they called, that they would carry out such an act . This call was made 3 days after the departure of the fruit shipment . We attempted to control the situation to the extent possible, following technical procedures concerning the amount of samples taken . Then we announced that the situation was under control, that it was an Anomyous call and as such could not be taken seriously . later, in the shipments that arrived in the United States last weekend, the presence of cyanide was detected in two grapes .

The major problem now involves the 17 million boxes that arrived at their ports of destination ready for distribution . Now no one knows what to do with them . There are 7 or 8 million boxes more being shipped to the same ports, and 3 million boxes remain in the country, ready to be shipped .

The Cable, which was read by Andres Allamand, stated: in view of the groundless and exaggerated measures taken by some members of your administration against Chilean fruit exports, we call your attention to the fact that these measures will ruin a large sector of Chilean private Enteprise, will leave hundreds of thousands of workers jobless, and will cause a serious imbalance in our balance of payments . These measures will seriously affect the good relations the Chilean people have always had with the U.S. people, and they will deeply injure those who, like us, defend free economy and free trade . most serious, however, is the fact that these measures apparently reward the terrorist activities against Chile, because they help the terrorists achieve their goals .

The regime has tried to blame us for a number of actions, such as the attack on a red cross ambulance, among others, for the same purpose . The Fmln has a definite policy of not harming the civilian population . The hurling of grenades at bus stops is a common practice of Army personnel and it is therefore preposterous to blame the Fmln . 3 . a number of false communiques with an obvious terrorist tone have appeared . They clumsily glorify violence and threaten the press in terms that are quite unlike those appearing in documents in which we outline our official position . We emphatically state that the Fmln has in no way or at any time threatened the press or the citizens . We recall the fact that our official communiques are signed by our general command and broadcast through our stations . We reiterate that the fundamental thing at this time is to reinforce and expand unity in the search for peace through every possible means . The struggle which we are waging with weapons in hand is aimed at an Army that has once more denied to our nation the possibility of finding a formula for a negotiated solution at an important crossroads in the nation's history . We made a proposal to hold free elections, in peace and for peace, but the Army stubbornly insists on holding fraudulent elections, at war and for war . Consequently, the elections will be held during war."

This was a fighter's way of repudiating the war elections that were held after the Fmln peace proposal was blocked . It also represented a defeat for the Reagan administration, which was bent on carrying out a deadly war against our people disguised as a hypocritical centrist and falsely Democratic Christian Democratic government . We struggle for a just and negotiated peace with genuine democracy, social justice, and national sovereignty, and we gave a World-Resounding blow to the enemies of peace . The thousands of Fmln fighters who fought throughout the country, cities and interior, encouraged by an unprecedented intensity and Simultaneity; the tens of thousands of union members, peasants, students, teachers, displaced persons, unemployed persons, government and municipal workers, mothers and family members of political prisoners and missing persons, members of community organizations, believers and representatives of all the churches who took to the street to demand that the Fmln peace proposal be accepted and who later repudiated the 19 March Warmongering elections; the hundreds of thousands of citizens, more than 1 million persons with valid voting cards, who refused to vote, and the more than 200,000 who cast a void or blank ballot--something the central electoral Council, the Nationalist Republican alliance, and the Christian Democratic party are trying to hide; the tens of thousands who voted for the Democratic convergence; and the hundreds of thousands who were not interested in getting their voting card that would allow them to participate in these discredited elections are the immense majority of the Salvadoran people who said no to the Counterinsurgency war and yes to a just political and negotiated solution to the National conflict . Yes to a real democracy; no to the traditional lie of a vote that only serves to justify and facilitate U.S. military aid, which promotes the continuation of the war and worsens the serious problems of poverty, misery, unemployment, and repression being experienced by our people . The 19 March elections were held, but hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans who live abroad were kept from voting . Many of these people fled the country because they were being persecuted or because the armed forces forced them to leave their homes through their bombings and other atrocities . They are active Salvadorans . Thanks to their work, hundreds of thousands of other Salvadorans, members of their families who have remained in El Salvador, can survive . However, these people were denied their right to vote, a right the Fmln proposal to turn the elections into a mechanism for peace would have granted them . Mr Alfredo Cristiani has declared himself the winner in an election that saw the largest abstention in these years of war . more than 60 percent of the Salvadoran people did not vote or cast void and blank votes . The votes Cristiani got do not total 20 percent of the Salvadoran people . Many of those who voted for Cristiani were deceived by arena's propaganda that promised employment, housing, education, schools, public health, economic recovery and prosperity, etc . Cristiani and arena know they are getting a country drowning in an economic and political crisis, with a growing revolutionary war, and they will not be able to keep those promises . No one can do anything without first achieving a just peace . for all these reasons, Alfredo Cristiani's election cannot be considered either morally or politically legitimate."

The voting Statistics paint a similar picture: in 29 of the 262 municipalities in which the country is divided, there was no voting at all . of the 2.2 million Salvadorans who should be on the voting lists, only 1.8 million were registered, and while 60 percent of the voters showed up at the polls for the 1984 elections, this figure was completely inverted this past 19 March . today--just like before the balloting began--peace, democracy, and social harmony in El Salvador as long as the United States and the Army continue to usurp the power formally represented by a civilian government, and any Presidential elections--in addition to yielding another farce similar to the one that has just been staged--will only result in an atmosphere of violence that might extend even further and reach even Bloodier proportions . If, on the contrary, those who really hold power were interested in a negotiated, peaceful solution to the Salvadoran conflict, they would at least be taking the first serious steps to meet with the other belligerent force: the Fmln . for the time being, however, the new electoral farce has accomplished nothing but to provide overwhelming proof that it is entirely unviable and ineffective."

It is characterized by an unprecedented annihilation campaign, which is aimed mainly at Functionaries and officials of the patriotic Union--a movement that includes Communist, Left-Wing, and other democratic forces . more than 800 up politicians have already had to pay for their support for a Democratic Colombia with their lives, Oscar Duenas noted . The Colombian Patriot said that the all-powerful narcotics mafia, in alliance with the large landowners, right-wing military, and parts of the Oligarchy are behind all these attacks . They fear for their power and are prepared to use any means to preserve it . from his own experience, Oscar Duenas reported how the death squad persecutes its opponents . a group which calls itself``Rambo""has waylaid him several times . However, up to now he has always been warned in time . There is always the danger of his being shot at from a window, a passing car, or from behind a Bush . This is why the government provides him--and other up politicians--with Bodyguards around the clock .``even though this means a permanent threat, we will continue to fight!""Oscar Duenas affirmed . Asked about the possibilities of a political solution, the city counselor of Tunja SEES an opportunity if the government cooperates with all Democrats in the fight against gang terrorism and does not try to split up the movement of the left."

Those elections were marked by abstention as a result of the rejection of the Farabundo Marti National liberation front peace proposal . Those elections were held while there was a war and while the country was divided . This clearly showed the Duality of power that exists . This clearly showed that the majority of the people are demanding a negotiated solution to the war . Without negotiation, no one can rule in El Salvador . Therefore, a military solution or the surrender of the Fmln is not possible . the future government has two options: to be a government that will increase the war or to be a government that will move toward peace . The Fmln joins all the national and international forces that expressed their concern for arena's coming to power . We do not believe in its campaign in which they are trying to present themselves as moderates . In less than 20 days, and without formally assuming power, there has been an increase in repression and social tension, as has been expressed in dozens of missing persons, murders, and arrests throughout the country . labor union offices and the National University campus have been cordoned off; civilians have been victims of terrorist attacks; grenades and bombs have been exploded in public places; and the Fmln is blamed for those attacks . journalists have been murdered; there has been a systematic intimidation of the press and attempts to curb freedom of expression; and members of the death squads linked to Roberto D'Aubuisson have been released from prison . There have been threats of Seizing land that belongs to Cooperatives; there have been announcements that the banking system and foreign trade will be privatized and that many government workers will be fired . There is a climate of terror throughout the country . This climate of terror is the result of the arrogance and the desire for revenge on the part of arena and sectors of the armed forces . arena has clearly stated that it will have a policy of killings and total warfare and has given no sign of wanting peace . It is urgent that an adequate framework for dialogue be created . This means arena must : 1 . cease all killings, arrests, Disappearances, and terrorist attacks on civilians; it must respect the press and freedom of expression and put an end to Militarization of workplaces, military Cordons, and all repressive actions perpetrated by the armed forces and the death squads . 2 . arena must respect the nationalization of banks, foreign trade, and agrarian reform . It must ensure that Cooperatives' property will be respected; that there will be no appropriation hearings involving people who have benefited from agrarian reform; and that there will be no economic measures aimed at forcing those people into bankruptcy or into selling their land . Likewise, arena must promise that there will be no mass Dismissals of government workers . 3 . arena must promise a real dialogue and not a useless dialogue aimed at bringing about the Fmln's surrender . arena, and the sectors it represents, has and always has had real power .

170,DEV-MUC3-0171,SOFIA ,1989-04-12,"Political life in Colombia is still linked with violence ..... Colombia is experiencing an extremely severe political and institutional crisis, caused by the incompatibility between the fast developing productive forces and the existing political setup . for example, last year Colombia's economic growth was 4.5 percent . However, political life continues to be dominated by the two old parties--the liberals and the conservatives, who maintain a merely formal democracy . We should not forget Colombia's strategic position: it forms a bridge between central and South America . All events in Colombia affect the neighboring countries . precisely because of this, the so-called``Santa Fe-2""document, drawn up by extreme right-wing U.S . politicians, contains a plan to apply pressure in Colombia and, more specifically, to expand the so-called Low-Intensity conflict, one of whose manifestations is the so-called``dirty war""in the country . Accordingly, the violence in Colombia is caused by both internal factors--the crisis of the institutions--and external ones, namely the policies of the most reactionary circles in the United States . can one expect the peace settlement to be fulfilled under these conditions? this is the aim of the Communist party of Colombia . at our recent 15th Congress, we made a detailed analysis of the situation and concluded that the conflict in Colombia must be settled by political means . The PCC raised the question of removing the siege situation that, with a few interruptions, has been maintained for several decades, and of disbanding the paramilitary groups . These groups owe their very existence to the support given by military circles and the clan Chiefs to the trade in narcotics . one of the PCC's demands is that the Army should be purged of Fascist elements and that a civilian should be put in charge of the Ministry of defense . The party also raised the question of making a start on the necessary democratic reforms, but the government pays no heed to our demands . The government recently reached an agreement with``M-19 ,""one of the partisan groupings in the country, but did not accept any commitments in practice . Accordingly, there are some doubts over how the lives of the partisan leaders will be subsequently guaranteed . the largest partisan group--the revolutionary armed forces of Colombia--is demanding that the government take serious steps to limit the paramilitary groups, in order to conclude a truce . clearly, it will not be easy to achieve peace in Colombia . at the moment, peace supporters in Colombia are forming a broad front, which in practice has an Antifascist orientation . peace depends on how far this front will succeed in expanding, how the contradictions within the government itself regarding the paramilitary groups will deepen, and on whether we will succeed in isolating them . We are optimists, but also have a great need of international solidarity . How do you assess the political prospects for the United left in your country? the left forces in Colombia are United in the patriotic Union that was created 4 years ago . its aim is to achieve national reconciliation in our country . However, the Union immediately became a target of the organizers of the``dirty war .""hundreds of its leaders were beaten up, many of whom were PCC members . so far, over 1,000 people have died, including Jaime Pardo Leal, leader of the patriotic Union, deputy chairman Jose Anteguera, and others . threats continue to be made against the Union and against the PCC . All members of the PCC leadership have received death threats . the same also applies to Bernardo Jaramillo, the present leader of the Union, Gilberto Vieira, Secretary General of the PCC central Committee, and others . On 27 February comrade Forero, PCC Secretary for organizational matters, was killed . his wife and comrades Sotelo and Sotomayor also died in the atrocity . next day, we had a meeting with Virgilio Barco, president of Colombia . He promises to take speedy measures against the paramilitary groups . However, only 4 days later, Anteguera, the former leader of the Union of Communist youth, was killed at Bogota airport . Senator Ernesto Pisano, one of the liberal party candidates for the Presidency, was seriously injured at the same time . Many members of the military were present at the airport on that day, as well as the police chief of the capital, yet only one of the murderers was killed, while the rest escaped . This is why we told President Barco that we had serious doubts about the Army's role in this assassination . next year, Presidential elections and elections of the legislative bodies are due to take place in Colombia . The PCC and the patriotic Union want to take part in them, but we have warned the leaders of the Republic that unless the``dirty war""is ended, we will expose the situation in Colombia to the world and regard the election results as illegal . Despite everything, we consider that the patriotic Union has a promising future, because its aims are supported by the Colombian people."

At approximately 0530 this morning, three explosives were hurled at his residence from an empty lot . The explosives caused extensive damage to the residence . There was rifle fire too, but the rifle fire was only to distract security personnel in the area . The attackers acted like animals . Mr Merino is still in the United States with his wife . He will be returning this afternoon . their four children and three of the children's friends were at the residence when the attack took place . The children could have been killed . those who carried out this attack are people who for a long time have been talking about human rights and about indiscriminate bombings . This attack endangered civilians . Thank goodness only one of the children was wounded . one of the girls who was visiting the home was hit by some shrapnel but the wound is not serious . right now we are getting a doctor to examine the children to see if their hearing has been damaged because two of the devices exploded in the bedroom the children were in . I believe this is another indication that the Fmln, far from seeking peace and wanting peace for the Salvadoran people, wants to continue its terrorism, its killings--its irrational killings . I believe that little can be achieved in the search for peace through dialogue because these people are not sincere when they claim that they want to resolve the problem . The Salvadoran people are tired of violence . They stated their opinion on 19 March . The Fmln should think carefully because the people have flatly rejected violence and the Fmln . I do not believe that the members of our party will be frightened into abandoning the struggle for the consolidation of democracy, which is something the people want . I believe that those who want to make the Fmln look like Martyrs and like persons who work for the good of the people, should know the truth: they are nothing but savages who lack human qualities and who are Indiscriminately killing and wounding civilians who have nothing to do with the conflict."

Undoubtedly, the most prominent action has been the attack on the Navy headquarters in San Salvador's Densely populated Santa Anita neighborhood . We are waiting for an official war Bulletin on that action . one of the most important characteristics of that attack is that it was staged despite the Army's presence in the heart of the capital, and it occurred in full daylight . At noon on Friday, a contingent of urban guerrillas got within 50 meters of the Navy headquarters and launched an attack with rifles and rocket launchers . every shot hit its target . Armed Forces patrols tried to cut off our fighters' retreat through the streets of the capital, but the soldiers were unsuccessful because in San Salvador, the people themselves form a mountain that provides cover for our urban guerrillas . early on Saturday morning, we ambushed an Army convoy on the Pan American highway at El Puntillal, Yapatztepeque, using eight explosive charges . The ambushed troops were reinforced by other units, with whom we fought for an hour . This ambush was carried out against enemy armored units .

184,DEV-MUC3-0185,PRAGUE ,1989-04-21,"Recently comrade Manuel Cepeda, member of the Colombian Communist party central committee Politburo, visited Czechoslovakia; we asked him for an interview . in the course of a few days at the beginning of March, three leading officials of the Colombian Communist party and the leftist coalition, the patriotic Union, comrades Forero, Sotelo, and Antequera, were murdered in Colombia . Why? in Colombia the dirty war stemming from the American tactics of so-called Low-Intensity conflict is intensifying . The internal political crisis is deepened by an alliance between the powerful drug smuggling Clans and the military leadership which is conducting the dirty war . in the Santa Fe II document, formulating future United States policy in Latin America, it is even said that unless the United States INTERVENES in the 1990's Colombia will become another El Salvador and on a much larger scale . The so-called extermination operation, also known as the Condor plan, is directed against the Communist party and up, against the unions, but also against priests who preach liberation theology, and recently this has intensified . In Colombia some elements of fascism openly manifest themselves . This is manifested in huge and unpunished Massacres and in the Powerlessness of President Barco and his civilian ministers who are not managing to keep the military leadership in check, although the President is the Supreme commander of the armed forces . Sometimes partisans are also accused of terror . that is one of the traits of American policy--to term any kind of revolutionary struggle, of struggle for democracy, and the people's movement as terrorism . Therefore, it also labels the Sandinistas in Nicaragua as terrorists and the Contra rebels as freedom fighters . by this I do not want to say that the partisans do not make mistakes, we also criticize them . for example, we condemned the destruction of oil Piplines by the Colombian partisan organization the National liberation Army . We do not agree with kidnapping civilians in exchange for ransom . We announced that, as long as it is impossible to end the conflict, it is necessary to humanize it and to respect human lives . These are the tactics of soldiers--to label the partisans as terrorists and then massacre the civilian population as suspects who are collaborating with terrorism . partisans from the revolutionary armed forces of Colombia offered the government a dialogue about a truce . How do they want to conduct this? the Farc, which is the strongest element of the Colombian partisan movement and a member of its coordinating Committee, unilaterally adopted a cease-fire and proposed the creation of a Commission for this dialogue . in it are two former Presidents, the liberal Lopez Michelsen and the conservative Pastrana, the chairman of the Association of industrialists Echeverri Correa, and Bogota's Cardinal Rebollo . The Farc wants the government to disband the paramilitary groups . The former interior Minister, Gaviria, said that there are 140 of them . This means that the government knows them . The Farc is demanding the purge of people from the Army command involved in the dirty war, that the defense Minister be a civilian, that the state of emergency be revoked, and that the road to real democracy be opened . But the government has begun negotiating with partisans from M-19 . The El Tiempo newspaper reported that the government promised them representation in Parliament by their inclusion as candidates of the liberal party . This is to involve four seats as long as M-19 lays down its arms and Disbands . The other partisans bitterly criticized this as a blow against the unity of the movement which will be abused for propaganda purposes . at the same time, M-19 represents only 5 percent of the movement . It is the intention of the government to divide the partisans . The Colombian Communist Party Congress took place in December . How did it react to the situation? the party called for peace and outlined the struggle for a Pluralist government of transition towards peace and democracy . at the end of February there was a central committee session which discussed the dirty war . It stated that, in spite of the terror, there had not been what had happened in similar situations in other Latin American countries, namely, mass emigration . to ensure that this does not happen in the future, the central committee discussed new measures, including the transition of part of the party to the underground . We will not all transfer, because now we must struggle for open contact with the masses, regardless of the huge risk which is linked to this . where is the party seeking allies? comrade Antequera, as deputy chairman of the up, had established a number of contacts . However, he was murdered, and Senator Samper Pisano, a politician from the ruling Liberal party, was seriously injured during the assassination at Bogota airport on 3 March . The assassination attempt against the 32-Year-Old prospective politician occurred the day after he announced his candidacy for the Presidency . He announced his support for Democratic coexistence, for an end to the dirty war which, as he said, is not in the interest of the Colombian people . Therefore, he was not a chance victim . It is also significant that the closed circuit television covering the airport, which is in the hands of the Army, was switched off . Thus, they wanted to prevent the murderers being filmed . one of them died, they let the other three escape . at the same time, Bogota's chief of police was at the airport along with another 10 colonels and a number of policemen and personal Bodyguards . How did the other parties react to the assassination? a joint document was signed by the Colombian Communist party, the up, and the liberal party, on whose behalf the former President Turbay Ayala signed . It demands that the government disband the paramilitary squads . It shows that opinions are beginning to differ, even in the ruling Liberal party . The conservatives are also emphatically criticizing the bloodbath and the passivity of the government, pointing out that their last President, Betancur, conducted a dialogue with the partisans . This is all happening before the elections which will take place next year . The Colombian Communist party leadership met with the President after the murder of comrade Forero . What was that about? in the conversation, we pointed to the fact that the defense Minister, General Guerrero Paz, travels around Colombia accompanied by the leader of the Ultra-Right wing, retired General Landazabal Reyes, who is leader of the paramilitary groups . We asked why these two are together . The President did not answer us . at the meeting we also said that, unless the dirty war stops, the Colombian Communist party for the first time in history will not take part in the elections . We will not be able to participate, because we are all being murdered . unless the government gives us a guarantee of security, we will not sacrifice more lives . Thank you for the interview."

I came here with the defense minister and with the President of the joint command to observe the site of a clash that occurred this morning, when an Army patrol coming from Jauja and heading for Julcan intercepted two vehicles carrying a large number of heavily armed subversives . According to the first reports, based on the documents seized from the subversives, they were heading for Concepcion, which they were planning to attack . Fortunately, they were intercepted by the Army at this place . We had 6 deaths, among them a lieutenant, while more than 60 subversives died . a total of 47 FAL rifles and submachine guns were recovered . They were heavily armed and they carried Knapsacks with bombs . They had vehicles an communications equipment . We came here to support the action by the Army, because the Army needs our support, and to let the entire country become aware of the seriousness of the situation and of the magnitude and intensity of the struggle that the armed forces are now waging in defense of democracy and of the nation . I believe that this dramatic event and the loss of our soldiers and officers should make the entire country aware of the enormous responsibility that each and every one of us share in the Antisubversive struggle . all the forces of the state and all the arms of the nation have been placed under the responsibility of the respective organizations, of the joint armed forces command, to fight and to eradicate this terrible threat of subversion . subversive violence has caused death, material losses, uncertainty, fear, and insecurity, and a threat to our democracy . Mr President, is there information on the group to which the subversives belong? according to the first reports, they belong to the Self- styled Tupac Amaru revolutionary movement . Mr President, you have two Passports in your hands . What do they say? Where were they issued and to whom did they belong? identification papers were found on almost all subversives, although most of them are forged . These two Bolivian Passports, however, are among the papers that seem to be legitimate . These Passports mark the arrivals an departures of persons who, as we can see, have misused the right to enter Peru . It seems that there are other foreigners among the dead subversives . According to an initial evaluation, many of those who attacked the town of Juanjui 1 1/2 years ago might be among the dead . Mr President, were the owners of those Passports the leaders of the subversive group? no, we cannot confirm that they were the leaders, but they were the persons to whom the Passports were issued . are there Chiefs among the dead subversives? according to the information gathered by the officers, there might be Chiefs among the dead . how many, Mr President? just a few, perhaps two or three, because of the arm bands they were wearing . The general told us that this is one of the harshest blows that the Army has dealt to subversives . is one of the strongest blows, and it will certainly not be the last one . We have total confidence in the armed forces joint command and we fully support its action . It is very deplorable, dramatic, and tragic that this dramatic event should convey the image of Peru to our own fellow countrymen and possibly to foreign countries . democracy, however, should defend itself . It is both necessary and imperative that we end this terrible threat through the military power of the nation and through the action of the government, which was elected by the people . This has been a hard blow, but it should be just one of the hard blows that the police and the armed forces deal until this threat is totally eliminated . Thank you, very much."

We hope that with new efforts and with the participation of Salvadoran political forces we peace . We also believe it is necessary for the Salvadoran conflict to be seen in its full dimension: it is part of a regional problem, and, consequently, the Presidents have discussed the subject of this internal conflict at their meetings . I have a question on bilateral relations . will your government respect the ruling by the International Court of Justice at the Hague regarding the demarcation of the border with Honduras? we are going to continue to respect the agreements between the two countries . We believe that we must begin to resolve all the differences that our two countries may have had as soon as possible . This is one of the things that we have mentioned to President Azcona . contrary to what some people may have said, we believe that we must seek a solution to the problems between our two countries as soon as possible and continue improving a relationship that had been suspended . We are going to respect the peace process that is already under way between the two countries, as well as the agreement to take the matter to the Icj for resolution . International reports state that violence has increased in El Salvador since your party won the elections . I would like to ask if you tried to contact the guerrillas prior to the elections or are you going to wait for the situation to deteriorate even further? take power? the Marxist guerrilla movement in El Salvador has publicly admitted that it is increasing its terrorist actions in our country in an attempt to destabilize the new government . We have not generated any violence; I believe the victory of our party in the recent elections did not represent more violence . Vice President-elect Merino headed the delegation that met with the Salvadoran guerrillas in Mexico, and from the very beginning we have expressed our willingness to seek, via a dialogue, a solution to our conflict . Naturally, we cannot yet act as a government, and we are going to respect the current government's relationship with the guerrillas . Once our administration is in place, we will continue to make the greatest effort to seek a dialogue and a solution . are you planning to ask the United States for an increase in economic and military aid? no . During our recent trip to Washington, all we said is that we trust that the U. S. government and people are in favor of the strengthening of democracy in El Salvador . on this occasion we benefitted from the democratic process, but this should not generate, a Priori, any prejudice against the new Salvadoran government that could result in a modification of U.S. aid to our country . We have not asked for any increase in aid . We believe that we should develop ourselves and have El Salvador become Self-Supporting . We hope that with the help of the Lord we will achieve this not because we do not want to maintain our friendship, but because we believe that El Salvador can become Self-Supporting . frankly, I was surprised by this statement by Daniel Ortega . I do not know what he has based his opinion on . I do not know if this is the result of meetings that he might have had with the members of the Farabundo Marti National liberation front who have just returned from Nicaragua . However, as we have just reiterated, our intention is to continue with the efforts that have been under way since Esquipulas II was signed, and to seek democracy and peace in Central America by means of a joint effort by our countries .

We contacted him by telephone, as follows: Colonel, is it true this is part of a regional or national operation to attack the Nationalist Republican alliance? I do not know if this is part of a regional or national operation . All I know is that these are treacherous, cowardly actions, because they are afraid of confronting the soldiers, the 3D infantry Brigade military units . In San Miguel, there were five explosions in open areas about 2 to 3 km apart . There were no casualties or material damage inflicted on the 3D infantry Brigade or its installations . They hit some fuel tanks filled with about 3,000 gallons of gasoline, which started a fire . However, the fires were in open areas, so there have been no casualties or material damage to the installations . The Farabundo Marti National liberation front claims it seized El Salitre estate and, from there, attacked the 3D infantry Brigade . El Salitre estate was not occupied . an old shack on the estate was set ablaze, but the fire Department controlled the fire . I think these are the great revolutionary victories the Fmln talks about: attacks against fixed installations that contain no military units, where not even peasants are sleeping at the time . I believe this is where the Fmln says it fights heroically for 4 hours to burn seven patches of crops and how it claims it heroically fights to down power towers, which are Unmoving objects . These are the only great actions it carries out, but these actions are against fixed targets that cannot move . I repeat, these are cowardly actions that do not confront the soldiers who represent the military abilities of the government and the country . do you have any units combing the area? Yes, definitely, we have men in the area . The truth is that at 0200 today, units were being mobilized . As I said, these are cowardly actions, carried out in the dark, and the Fmln flees when it sees our well-trained men in military uniform . that is all I have to say . You have permanent guards for San Miguel . Some of the market vendors told us for the first time, not a single shot was heard . Yes, that is right . As I said, there have not been any attacks or Harassment, just five explosive devices, which does not represent any changes in the correlation of military forces . The people of San Miguel should be calm; we will provide them with security . The people of the Eastern area of the country should be calm, because we will increase our abilities and efforts to provide them with all the security possible . The Fmln will have to pay for being so Audacious . The Fmln said it was fighting in Berlin and Alegria . We have no knowledge of any action in Berlin and Alegria . We have reports that in San Ildefonso, San Vicente Department--south of cabanas--there were problems because the National Guard--which we support throughout the National territory--reported some catapults had been fired . However, nothing else happened, and I have no reports of any action in other places . today is mother's day .

205,DEV-MUC3-0206,HAVANA ,1989-05-10,"The latest coup attempt against Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo is not an isolated event . It shows the Christian Democratic government's Precariousness . unable to make good its lukewarm election promises, this government has taken a completely defensive policy . harassed by attempted coups, government corruption, administrative ineptness, and insurgent activities, Cerezo's administration is plagued by evident instability . his government is still hostage to the military high command, which temporarily surrendered power after many years of dictatorship . Nevertheless, Cerezo is the victim of military men who have been kept away from positions of greater power by their fellow officers . This seems to have been the cause of the most recent plot against the civilian government . This plot, Masterminded by air force officers, was crushed by officers who decided to support the President for the time being . Guatemala , 85 percent of whose population lives in poverty, is plagued by paramilitary groups that spread panic, particularly among the peasant and Indian population, in collusion with the powerful and well-armed Army . Another sign of the government's increasing weakness is that important decisions are made by the military high command, which dominates key economic sectors . Cerezo's power was threatened a few days ago by the disclosure that Guatemalan forces for a long time had been staging joint Counterinsurgency operations with U.S . soldiers . This participation casts doubts on Cerezo's alleged active neutrality in Central America and turns Guatemala into just another springboard for the deployment of U.S . forces as part of the so-called Low-Intensity war . According to the Guatemalan national revolutionary unity, war exercises are staged in Guatemala with troops from the U.S . bases in the Panama Canal area . On 31 January, a U.S . pilot flying a U.S . plane was killed when he tried to land at the Guatemala city Air Force base . The rebels asserted the plane was hit by Antiaircraft fire . In addition, U.S . troops were deployed in Guatemala's Chimaltenango Department in November 1988 . shortly after the murder of 22 peasants last February, the guerrillas noticed flights near the scene of the massacre by U.S. Air Force Chinook helicopters that participated in Counterinsurgency operations or in missions to support the Guatemalan Army . The most recent coup attempt in Guatemala and the discovery of an increasing presence of U.S . troops in that country has placed Cerezo's government in a serious, difficult position . Cerezo seems to be forced to obey a society made up of people much more powerful than him."

The presence here of the foreign ministers of the group of 8, with just one exception, was agreed during a previous conversation in which we decided that Paraguay must be given the chance that it deserves following the recent elections that reflected the will of the people . and this is what we want, the strengthening of democratic institutions . What does all that mean? it means that the Paraguayan opposition was able to perform its supervisory role without obstacles, and that the process was observed by independent journalists, who made use of freedom of expression to guarantee the legitimacy of the process . your remarks are very significant, particularly now that the Peruvian government is fighting a guerrilla force that jeopardizes the democratic system . right . In Peru we are fighting for human rights . It is a well known fact that the world is rightly concerned about the human rights of those who are arrested during an Antisubversive action . Yet there is little concern about the human rights of those who defend democracy, within a democracy . democracy must defend itself . In this context the subject of responsibility is not well defined . do you mean that a military government is at times more effective? no . It is much more effective for repression, but I made it clear that subversion in a democracy is unjustified and that Democratic governments do not promote human rights violations . If there are any human rights violations in a democracy, they stem from excesses by the repressive forces . What is the Diffrence between these types of repression? it is simple . in a dictatorship, repression is widespread and almost always arbitrary, and there is no one to defend human rights . It is estimated that Alan Gacia has already shown that there is a limit to what a Charismatic leader can do . In fact, he is young, handsome, and he is a good Speaker . However, he could not solve the problems . What does Peru need in order to implement the much desired stabilization of the democratic institutions? Peru needs economic stability, because the government experience and with a strong desire to distribute wealth . The distribution of wealth was done during the first 2 and 1/2 years . The negative side of this is that domestic consumption was Overstimulated . Even though it might seem contradictory, our productive apparatus needed more imported materials in order to increase local production . This led to a dangerous decrease in our reserves . Simultaneousnly, the bank nationalization law was set in motion . This provided the perfect framework for the destruction of the system . There was also the early start to the electoral campaign, and finally the radical opposition by the business sector of a democratic government . There has also been a growth in the crime rate and the costly process of fighting the shining path guerrillas in the mountains and in urban terrorist actions . This could easily lead to the conclusion that Peruvian democracy does not have good prospects, right? Quito to the contrary . democracy will be preserved even if the normal handing over of power to the new administration becomes the only objective of the recently installed cabinet . This, however, will become the sole objective only in an Estreme situation . There are obviously other objectives, but I want to stress the significance that we attach to the handing over of power to the winner of clean elections, with guarantees for all opposition parties . This is how the democratic process will be preserved and this is how this government will attain one of its main targets."

The interior Minister added that this alleged organization that claimed responsibility for the murder, has no ties with the Peruvian shining path terrorist group . to this moment, and due to the seriousness of the case, I do not dare to admit the Existance of any relationship between these two terrorist groups . If the shining path is operating in Bolivia, it should announce that it is in fact shining path that is committing these crimes . We can say the same thing about the National liberation Army in the 1960's, when it did not hide its identity . This was an international group . They arrived in Bolivia without hiding their international identity, and there are many Bolivians who can tell us about the National liberation Army . Now, if this crime was committed by the shining path, then it was committed by the shining path and not by the Zarate Wilka group . I do not want to discard this possibility, however, I do not want to admit it as something verified and confirmed . Our obligation, as members of the executive branch, is to release the results of something obvious, fully verified and confirmed . The interior Minister added that the existence of the self-styled Fal-Zarate Wilka group and of shining path members in Bolivia is doubtful, because in the criminal cases recorded in Cochabamba and in Oruro recently, the police discovered that common criminals, and especially those linked to the world of drug addition and drug trafficking were directly involved in those crimes . regarding the murder of the two missionaries in La Paz last Wednesday, the interior Minister stated that no one has been detained, but that the investigations by the intelligence services continue . No . We cannot suppose the existence of a terrorist group in Bolivia . and what about these murder cases? I do not know . many people can be hiding behind this Zarate Wilka group . We do not know anything about this Zarate Wilka group . We do not know anything about their political Leanings, or what party is behind this group . This could have been a common crime, or maybe not . But we cannot just go out and say: yes, this group last night Machinegunned these people, that they escaped, etc . This would mean a very irresponsible behavior . The executive branch wants to deal with this case as seriously as possible and not cause the people to panic . We must do something for the country . We should unite our forces, all coalition parties, the ruling party, the executive branch, the armed forces, the national police, and all Bolivians, to defend our democracy .

During this clash, which lasted 4 hours, Arce Battalion was supported by two Rocket-Firing helicopters, a Hughes 500, and a A-37 plane . Salvadoran troops sustained numerous casualties, including a wounded Arce Battalion officer . Honduran troops were pushed back and cornered in Los Llanitos, Santa Lucia jurisdiction, Intibuca Department, Honduras . Arce Battalion landed troops from four helicopters in that village .

The Farabundo Marti National liberation front had warned that Honduran troops' cooperation and involvement in the Salvadoran war, following a U.S. decision, would eventually lead to a clash between the two armies . It is a secret to nobody that the Oligarchs who have reached power with the Nationalist Republican alliance government are the same ones who promoted the invasion of Honduras in 1969 and that the officers who were responsible at the time for Massacres, raids, and abuses against the Honduran people are the same ones who are in the hierarchy of the Salvadoran Army . We believe Hondurans must think about this situation, because this level of confrontation with infantry troops and aircraft will set the tone of the conflict for the definition of the border conflict of a government of Oligarchs who have always supported an expansionist policy toward Honduras . Once again, we call on the Honduran people to stop their Army's involvement in someone else's war in El Salvador, its main enemy . We call on the national and internal press, especially Honduran media, to visit Los Llanitos, Santa Lucia, Intibuca Department, to confirm these serious incidents .

243,DEV-MUC3-0244,SAN PEDRO SULA,1989-06-09,"When we asked the foreign Ministry why the Honduran government has not protested the Salvadoran armed forces attacks on Honduran Army soldiers and a helicopter in Los Llanitos, the answer was very simple, but it shows the importance that is given to national sovereignty and integrity: the armed forces have not informed us of anything at all--they said--and what the media says is not accurate . The newspapers Tiempo and La Prensa published reports of the incident with photographs that confirmed the aggression, the bombing and shelling of villages in our territory, and provided accounts by Eyewitnesses and municipal authorities, but which, according to the foreign Ministry, lack credibility or importance . later foreign newsmen went to these places and confirmed what Tiempo and La Prensa had reported . They also obtained other details on the incidents . While the Honduran and Salvadoran armed forces denied the incident, despite the evidence, the truth is there for the gentlemen of the foreign Ministry to see . According to statements by the villagers who were the victims of the Salvadoran aggression, the Honduran military threatened them and ordered them to be silent or to lie about what had happened . It was necessary for the Santa Lucia Mayor to intervene before they could tell newsmen what had happened . A reporter for La Prensa was sidetracked by a commander, no doubt to keep him from doing his job as a journalist . The Honduran Army's weapons served to keep the aggression quiet instead of Repelling it, to threaten Honduran border villagers instead of protecting them, while the Army turned its back on the enemy armed forces--which have trampled on our territory and humiliated us--instead of fighting them . In short, the weapons that we Hondurans and the armed forces have obtained with so much sacrifice, even at the expense of going without food and medicine, are used against Honduras and its people . This situation should cause us to give much thought to the existence of the Honduran armed forces . We anticipated this when the regional military training and security center was created exclusively to train 10,000 Salvadoran troops--the same Army that invaded us in 1969 and that is attacking us again . We wonder if we are not acquiring a Mercenary mentality in Honduras, whereby the state's weapons go to the highest bidder rather than being used in the national interest . for the past 7 years they have been used for economic--though ideologically disguised--benefits . No national military force can function like this anywhere in the world . In any event, the ideology of any Army should be nationalistic, even in the case of powers and superpowers that invent and use internationalist ideologies for their Hegemonic struggles . here in Honduras the case of the armed forces is just the opposite . to the military Institute's way of thinking, those who are demanding the defense of sovereignty and territorial integrity are subversives who are Allied with subversives from other countries . An aggression against Honduras by a foreign Army is legitimized by the people attacked and those who inform and protest are enemies of the Fatherland . This was stated in an editorial of the Honduran armed forces'``military projections""program . The editorial said that the report was issued``without prior investigation""and was based solely``on information provided by these groups to confuse national and international public opinion .""`` the irresponsibility of some print and broadcast media directors has reached the point that they are promoting these clearly Marxist - Leninist subversives, financed by Cuba and Nicaragua, and those who do not hide their open sympathy with Pseudo-Professional positions . They attempt to conceal this by claiming that radio stations or newspapers have unrestricted freedom of expression .""a similar explanation was presented by the Salvadoran embassy in Tegucigalpa in a press communique distributed to the media, which published and disseminated it--although it appears incredible--through the official Presidential House bulletins . We might add that the Honduran Army has echoed such reports, as an accomplice to a propaganda ploy to cover up an aggression against our country . We ask, therefore:``What is left of our national institutions? What is Honduras? who are Hondurans? ''"

These Mercenary groups have continued their attacks against Nicaragua, adding new victims to the thousands of citizens who have already suffered the effects of U.S . aggression and the participation and complicity of your government with that illegal policy . The well-known U.S. policy of maintaining Contra forces in Honduran territory and its constant criminal attacks against the Nicaraguan population--which have left 163 civilian victims since the Costa del Sol summit on 31 may--characterizes the talks between U.S. government officials and Contra leaders, as well as the tragic consequences in the loss of human lives and property damage in my country . While vice president Quayle was meeting with the mercenaries, pastoral representatives in Waslala and Las Minas informed the international community of the hundreds of peasants who have been murdered, kidnapped, and tortured by the Mercenary groups that infiltrate Nicaragua from Honduras . at the same time, the defense Ministry reported on the continuation of attacks against agricultural Cooperatives, among them one in San Jose, Tijuana, Southeast of Asturias, Jinotega Department, where four peasants were killed on 10 June . in the Costa del Sol declaration, the central American Presidents committed themselves to carrying out the demobilization, repatriation, and relocation of the Mercenary groups currently based in your country . However, your government has supported--against the legitimate interests of the Honduran people--the option set forth by a U.S . bipartisan agreement aimed at maintaining the Contras in Honduran territory . interviews with Honduran political leaders, such as the one published in the daily La Tribuna in its 13 June edition, clearly state that the U.S. vice president did not go to Honduras to solve its economic problems, but to obtain a confirmation from the government that it will not expel the Contras from Honduran territory . In consenting to the continued presence in its territory of Mercenary forces--which were created to attack my country--the Honduran government is not only helping to bring more suffering and destruction to the Nicaraguan people and nation, but is also continuing the heavy burden on the Honduran people, who have also been the victims of criminal and terrorist actions . with this behavior, the Honduran government once again Evinces its total noncompliance with international commitments, which are also expressed in the Esquipulas agreements, to not permit the use of its territory to attack other States and to discontinue its support for irregular forces . The Nicaraguan government strongly protests the fact that your country continues to allow the use of its territory to conduct illegal policies that go against the Esquipulas agreements and the peace efforts and that violate the principles and norms established by international law to guarantee the peaceful coexistence of States . your government should reflect on this and heed the calls made by the Honduran people themselves, who demand an end to the country's involvement in an illegal and adventurous policy and that the agreements signed in Costa del Sol calling for the implementation of a joint plan for the demobilization, repatriation, and relocation of the irregular forces based in your country be honored . I take this opportunity to reiterate my esteem to your Excellency . Miguel D'Escoto Brockman, foreign minister, Republic of Nicaragua"

We delayed making this statement to make certain that there were no Circumstantial or other reasons that could have involved us in the attack . 2 . Following Rodriguez Porth's death, several groups have conducted markedly Vengeful actions . Colonel Ochoa Perez, for example, has proposed fighting fire with fire . Francisco Merino has threatened opposition leaders with death . Ricardo Alvarenga Valdivieso has proposed repressive new laws . We hereby warn that if reprisals are taken against the opposition movement, we will take firm and resolute action against any escalation in repression . 3 . We find the false commotion among the ranks of the arena party repulsive, because everyone knows of their responsibility in killings like that of Monsignor Romero, of the members of the FDR executive committee, and so many others . We do not believe in their alleged innocence, and do even less at a time when repressive actions are being intensified . 4 . Our attention has been drawn to the fact that the attack on Rodriguez Porth occurred within the framework of an intense struggle between the entrepreneurial sector and D'Aubuisson's supporters to gain control of the party, and within the framework of a dispute for the defense Ministry . in the latter case, Rodriguez Porth's actions did away with General Bustillo's aspirations . There are precedents for the line of conduct of arena factions and for these internal confrontations . We recall the attack that Roberto D'Aubuisson perpetrated against former U.S . Ambassador Thomas Pickering . We also remember how important men close to major Roberto D'Aubuission participated in the kidnapping of businessmen . major D'Aubuission's silence concerning the attack on Rodriguez Porth is noteworthy . The Fmln understands the concern of the various national sectors and the international community in the sense that arena may use this fact to justify irrational retaliatory actions . If a situation is brought about, involving an increase in violence and expansion of the war, it will be the arena government's sole responsibility, not ours . for this reason, we have raised with the political parties the need to create conditions for establishing a favorable climate for dialogue and a negotiated political solution . We reiterate our total readiness to contribute toward this effort .

General Oscar Vargas, the Minister Secretary General of government, reported on this plan during a 2-Hour cabinet meeting that was chaired by Chilean President general Augusto Pinochet . The minister said that there are clear indications of such a plan, emphasizing that the civilians have great responsibility because the struggle against the subversion cannot be conducted without the assistance of civilians . Gen Vargas pointed out that the recent attacks on Armed Forces and the security services personnel, the robbery of cars--according to the police, a military truck and 18 private vehicles have been stolen--and the stealing of car license plates at the municipalities are a clear indication that these groups are about to begin their activities . This week, several unidentified individuals attacked an Army Non- commissioned officer, who is a member of the National intelligence center and who was seriously injured, and last week a retired Air Force officer was murdered . The minister added that a coordination among all the terrorist groups that are operating in the area has been noticed, especially by the shining path . This matter was discussed by the Peruvian defense minister in a speech he made in Lima last week . concerning the measures taken, Gen Vargas said:``all government authorities have been instructed to take care .""Gen Vargas categorically denied that the possibility that general Augusto Pinochet could run in the Presidential elections scheduled for 14 December 1989 was discussed in the cabinet meeting held today at the La Moneda Presidential Palace . for his part and in a news conference, Sergio Onofre Jarpa, a Rightwing presidential candidate and the President of the Progovernment national renewal party, said that his nomination``would not make any sense if Pinochet runs for the same political sector .""Jarpa reiterated that if the incumbent, who has been president since 1973, wants to run for President,``it will be necessary to reform the 1980 Constitution""because article 25 prevents the Chilean President from seeking re-election."

Cristiani had this to say: the Fmln general command said they had not ordered the assassination and added that apparently a group got out of hand and perpetrated the crime . I think the Fmln has realized the general repudiation this action has elicited . I am convinced the Fmln is trying to excuse the action, thus avoiding all responsibility . We think they are trying to seek a way out of the problem caused by the assassination of an aged, defenseless person . But there is no way out for them now . The Fmln has denied that any of its members participated in the action . of course, they are now trying to deny it after they learned of the repudiation both here and abroad . In addition, they waited a considerable time to deny their participation . They had a complete plan against the government .

We think we should overcome the effect of this heavy blow caused by the loss, not only of a column of the party and of our ideology, but also of a personal friend . As members of the government, we should overcome our grief and seek the good of the country . We believe violence is repudiated and rejected in the country . It is time for the Fmln to talk about its objectives . They have rejected the opportunity to talk with the government with unacceptable and unjustifiable arguments .

However, that guerrilla group has denied any responsibility for the action .

The terrorist attack in Huila Department took place in La Motosa, near Aipe municipality, where the pipeline that pumps crude oil between Neiva and La Dorada was dynamited . Humberto Brines traveled early today to the scene of the events and reported the following: a new attack was perpetrated last night against the pipeline that pumps crude oil from Neiva to Dorada . suspected ELN guerrillas placed a dynamite charge at the place called La Motosa, near Aipe municipality, which completely destroyed the guard post and a stretch of the pipeline . a fire immediately broke out and the installation was completely gutted . crude oil pumping was suspended and efforts to contain the fire and to repair the pipeline began at 2300 . The extent of the losses has not yet been assessed . This pipeline pumps 58,000 barrels of oil per day . The main pumping station is located in Aipe municipality . workers from and Ecopetrol worked intensely all through the predawn hours to repair the pipeline, enabling it to resume pumping operations at 1000 . Even though the ELN has repeatedly threatened the oil pipelines, work has continued on the construction of a new multiple pipeline in Huila, which will pump 138,000 barrels of oil per day between Neiva and Covenas . the same pipeline was blown up only 1 month ago, a scarce 25 km from that place."
255,DEV-MUC3-0256,BOGOTA,1989-06-20,"The damage caused by the latest terrorist attacks against the country's oil pipeline has so far been estimated at almost 75 billion pesos . According to Ecopetrol, there have been four dynamite attacks on the pipeline in the last 72 hours . because of the attacks, Colombia will have to abstain from marketing crude oil abroad for 3 weeks, thus losing $150 million . The damage caused to the Covenas plant amounts to $7 million; another $7 million will have to be spent on repairs . Ecopetrol president Andres Restrepo Londono said that the Colombian people will feel the impact of these attacks . already the royalties given to the municipalities have been suspended, and an increase in fuel prices will be necessary, according to the first special meeting of the country's Petroleum enterprise authorities . Meanwhile, the Army has increased its Counteroffensive against ELN guerrillas, which have claimed responsibility for the attacks on the oil pipeline, exerting pressure to modify the oil policy . The latest attack on the pipeline occurred at the Lisama installations, located between Barrancabermeja and Bucaramanga . ELN guerrillas attacked these Installlations, which are responsible for producing gas and Petroleum . The guerrillas cut 80 percent of the cables attached to the Motors which extract fuel . A dynamite charge was also placed on the pipeline at Km-28 in Cano Limon-Covenas, in the area of Carmen, near the Tonchala River, in northern Santander . No fuel, however, was lost . The attacks have now extended to Huila Department for the first time, damaging fuel installations . Here the oil spill was stopped by closing down the installations . Furthermore, nine guerrillas have been killed, eight more have been captured, and an ELN training center has been dismantled . This is the result of the Army's first Counterinsurgency actions against those determined to do away with the nation's resources by attacking the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline . military authorities have reported that near Serrania de Perija, Cesar Department, the 2d Brigade's Battalion troops clashed with ELN guerrillas . The clash resulted in the death of six guerrillas and the Confiscation of a great amount of war materiel . In addition, the Army dismantled an ELN urban network, capturing eight of its members . Meanwhile, the 14th Brigade's Battalion troops killed Jose Antonio Velasco, a Farc leader .

According to Leyva, Perez expressed his willingness to meet with him to explain the guerrilla group's ideas on what Colombia's oil policy should be . Leyva said that the ELN also demanded that nationalization be applied to other natural resources . Furthermore, the ELN--which has previously rejected the government's peace offer--reiterated its desire to``humanize""the conflict between the guerrillas and the Army, so that the civilian population will not be affected . Leyva has played a leading role in seeking a rapprochement between guerrilla groups and the government . to this end he has met several times with M-19 and revolutionary armed forces of Colombia commanders, which is why the ELN selected him as the bearer of its message . The ELN has concentrated its terrorist attacks against the country's main oil pipeline, which extends 800 km from the Eastern to the Northwestern regions of Colombia . It has caused millions in losses to the state Colombian Petroleum enterprise and serious ecological damage resulting from oil spills . in 1988, it attacked the nation's pipelines approximately 50 times, and thus far this year the ELN has carried out 21 attacks . On 16 June, the main oil reserves in the Caribbean port city of Covenas were virtually destroyed by several dynamite blasts set off by the guerrillas . This was the ELN's most daring and serious attack to date . The ELN claims that the multinational companies that carry out oil exploration and drilling with Ecopetrol are``plundering""Colombia's natural resources."

277,DEV-MUC3-0278,BOGOTA,1989-07-03,"Armed Forces commander general Oscar Botero Restrepo reported today that guerrillas of the pro - Castro army of national liberation set fire to three tank trucks that were carrying oil from the Cano Limon oilfield in Arauca Department, which borders Venezuela, to Colombia's interior . The attack was carried out in Boqueron, between Pajarito and Yopal, in Casanare Department, where the subversives have unleashed a violent campaign against Colombia's oil infrastructure to force their demands for the nationalization of the oil industry . Gen Botero said that the rebels--who have dynamited the country's main oil pipeline, the Cano Limon - Convenas pipeline , 23 times thus far this year--intercepted the vehicles in the middle of the highway and set them on fire after forcing the drivers to get out of the vehicles . The ELN guerrillas simultaneously wrote slogans in support of the so-called Simon bolivar national guerrilla coordinating board . During the last few hours, this group agreed with President Barco's administration to begin a direct dialogue to seek peace in Colombia . No deaths were reported in the attack by the ELN, which was founded during the 1960's and is led by Manuel Perez, a Spanish priest . Meanwhile, another commando group from the Camilist Union, ambushed a military patrol on the Agua Azul - Terranova highway, also in Casanare, killing two soldiers . Gen Botero said that two soldiers stepped on a mine during the guerrilla attack and three other soldiers were wounded."
278,DEV-MUC3-0279,BOGOTA,1989-07-04,"Recently new phenomena have made their way onto the Colombian political scene . The government of President Virgilio Barco Vargas has been forced to adopt measures against ultra right-wing paramilitary organizations and differences are beginning to appear in the government and in the armed forces . These arguments are taking place in connection with discussions prior to the elections which are expected to take place in Colombia in 1990 . after the Colombian Communist party had demanded from the government secure guarantees that it can participate in them, it announced that it will become involved in the electoral process and now it is striving to create a broad Democratic coalition . The approaching elections as well as the widespread International condemnation of the``dirty war""in Colombia forced the government to take more decisive steps in a number of spheres . The most important of these are :--issuing Presidentially proclaimed decrees against hired assassins and creating an elite military force for the struggle against them; organizing a struggle against ultra right-wing paramilitary groups and increasing prison sentences up to 20-30 years for soldiers and civilians who are members of them ;--conducting a dialogue between the leftist coalition patriotic Union and the Supreme commander of the Army with the participation of the Minister of defense ;--conducting a purge in the Army directed against the officers who are associated with with groups of hired assassins . The reason for accelerating these measures was the assassination attempt against the head of the secret police, General Miguel Maza Marquez, carried out on 30 may by paramilitary groups which are controlled by drug traffickers . a vehicle filled with 100 kg of dynamite was used to try to assassinate the head of state security . The general escaped without injury but during the assassination attempt 7 people were killed and more than 50 were wounded . because of this Act differences in the armed forces and in the Colombian government further intensified . Maza Marquez has been the sworn enemy of the mafia and the object of their threats since he revealed that the gangs which carry out assassination attempts against the Ccp and the patriotic Union are trained mercenaries from the United States, Israel, the Frg, and great Britain . After escaping from an assassination attempt on 3 may, General Maza Marquez sent a letter to the state Prosecutor . in it he said that certain groups in the Army knew about the assassination attempt which had been prepared against him . During the same period captain Wanumen was imprisoned; he had secret documents from the Council of ministers, the national security Council, the U.S. Embassy in Bogota, the Das, and the American CIA which list highly placed individuals in the government who work as``spies""for the benefit of drug traffickers from the Medellin and CALI cartels . Although President Barco Vargas denied the authenticity of the documents, reports are generally disseminated that the ruling elite has been infiltrated with mafia agents . In this situation space opens up for the Ccp's proposal to introduce peace to the country by way of a dialogue between the government and all partisan groups, not just with the M-19 movement, as the government has practiced to date . Although the situation in Colombia is still serious, there are definite signs of a turnaround for the better."

280,DEV-MUC3-0281,TEGUCIGALPA,1989-07-05,"The Honduran foreign relations Ministry, based on reports from authorities in charge of security matters related to the interrogation of Captain Adan Solorzano Martinez--an intelligence agent of the Sandinist government--informs the national and international public of the following: it is a known fact that with the intensification of the arms race by the Sandinist government and the use of Nicaraguan territory as a political and military base for subversive groups, there has been an increase in the number of revolutionary activities, assassinations, terrorist attacks, and other forms of political, economic, and social Destabilization in the region . over the past 9 years, El Salvador has been the primary target of international subversion and terrorism . Honduras, however, has also been affected by these actions on various occasions . We recall the deplorable kidnapping of 100 persons at the Chamber of Commerce and industries in Cortes in 1982; the illegal hijacking of Tan-Sahsa aircraft by terrorist Commandos who always ended up seeking refuge in Managua or Havana; the planting of two bombs that destroyed power plants in Tegucigalpa, as well as other terrorist acts against Honduras both inside and outside the country; clandestine arms trafficking, etc . On 27-28 June, the Honduran government and people were shocked by a statement made in San Pedro Sula by a Nicaraguan citizen who, according to his statements, is an Army captain and intelligence agent for the Sandinist regime . He disclosed that, in August 1988, he was assigned the missions of planning the assassination of the President of the Republic and the beheading of the Honduran spiritual and political leadership through the physical elimination of Honduran Archbishop Msgr Hector Enrique Santos and presidential candidates Carlos Roberto Flores and Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero, of the liberal and national parties respectively . The Sandinist foreign Ministry responded to these reports by issuing a 29 July 1989 communique, in which it openly admitted that Nicaraguan citizen Orlando Adan Solorzano Martinez was an Army Lieutenant--not a captain--and that he had worked for the Nicaraguan interior Ministry for 7 and 1/2 years, from 20 August 1979 to 28 January 1987 . The communique added that on 28 January 1987, Solorzano had been fired and that his record showed a long list of disciplinary actions . This explanation very conveniently allows Nicaragua to disassociate itself from the espionage and terrorist activities of its intelligence agent in the event he was caught or deserted . Undoubtedly, the Sandinist government, because of its ideology and because it has close ties to the financing and training--both politically and militarily--of central American Terrrorist groups, has been directly involved at various levels in these groups' criminal activities, which violate international norms on peaceful coexistence and human rights . This situation has given rise to the different peace efforts that have sprung up in the region to attempt to put an end to these actions . The Honduran security authorities have known for a long time about espionage activities against Honduras and the links between Nicaraguan Embassy personnel in Tegucigalpa and Honduran rebel groups that have been trained in special camps in Nicaragua and other totalitarian countries."

In addition, the ELN sent a letter to President Barco . parliamentarians Guillermo Alberto Gonzalez and Orlando Gomez will deliver the letter to the President tomorrow . In this letter, the ELN lists its demands, which, if met, would lead them to halt the blowing up of oil pipelines . According to Gonzalez, the guerrilla group demands the dismissal of Mines Minister Oscar Mejia and Ecopetrol president Andres Restrepo . The ELN also conditioned their suspension of attacks against the pipelines on the creation of a national Petroleum Council and a forum for a debate to review the current oil policy . My impression during my 2 days of captivity is that they attach great importance to a debate on the nation's oil policy . They demand that this debate be carried out through a council meeting, which would include representatives from the government, labor unions--particularly the and Ecopetrol unions--as well as several prominent figures whom they listed in the letter to the President . Gonzalez added that he agrees with comptroller Rodolfo Gonzalez that the government should talk with the ELN, a guerrilla group which in the past has been the most unwilling to join the peace process . If the dialogue results in a solution to Colombia's public unrest, then we must not avoid the dialogue; we must hold it."

The truth is that at approximately 0030 today, there was an attack with a homemade bomb in La Ceiba, and, as a result, seven U.S . soldiers--not six--were wounded . four sustained very minor injuries, while three were somewhat seriously wounded, but they are not in danger of dying . Nine soldiers were in that group . They were not on leave; they were on a mission from the Enrique Soto Cano Honduran air base at Palmerola . They provoked.... Instead, I should say that they went to have some fun at the Dilido Discoteque . Our military police patrols were in the area and saw the attack . We captured two suspects . Our men were about 100 meters away when the attack occurred, and, unfortunately, the two suspects are U.S. citizens . In other words, people were in the area and no one knew what they were doing . This is an official report; this is what took place in La Ceiba . The two suspects were arrested, and they must know something about the seven who were wounded, who are at the hospital . What you reported over the radio is correct . There is no need to be alarmed . It was a homemade bomb, and the damage was caused by the shrapnel, cement, and stones that were thrown into the air by the explosion . However, I would like to deny a report by the Milkman from, who said that the city has been shut down and is being held hostage . that is not true . When the incident occurred, the patrols were already on the streets and reported the incident . Fusep was instructed to conduct investigations, and therefore vehicles entering or leaving La Ceiba were stopped and searched . that is all; standstill merely because three or four people have been wounded, or because two or three are critically wounded . The city must function normally . The Armed Forces are interested in the continuation of production . So the man from who called and said that he was losing 100,000 Lempiras this morning was telling a lie . We gave specific instructions that the inspection of vehicles should be carried until 0500, and that the vehicles should not be detained . Colonel, it was the Chamber of Commerce President who provided the report and said that the delivery of milk had been stopped . with all due respect for him--whom I do not know personally--I must say that it is not true that we are stopping vehicles . We stopped a very small white Van with some laborers in it to search the Van . I was there on the highway . There was no milk on that bus; there were people on that bus, and I myself allowed them to continue . I am sorry that the Chamber of Commerce has been Misinformed . We are not paralyzing activities, nor are we holding the city hostage . As I said, we are trying to conduct an investigation and we have arrested two people . We are not sure if they were the ones who perpetrated the attack; we are not sure of anything . We are merely conducting investigations and taking preventive measures . Colonel, are the two men you have in custody the same U.S. citizens you mentioned at the beginning of this report? yes . The lieutenant in charge of the patrol the pants, clothes, and the color of what they were wearing indicated that they were civilians . Lieutenant Salgado of the 4TH Battalion was 50 meters away when the explosion occurred . two persons were captured . However, they have denied that either of them was involved . that remains to be seen . We have been waiting for about 30 minutes for the armed forces investigative personnel to arrive to learn the identities of the two men who are being held . The investigation will be completely professional . We two or three persons were injured . We are not paralyzing production; I want to made this clear . Yes, of course . Colonel, given the situation, do you believe that the situation in the armed forces is completely normal? of course it is completely normal . We are not restricting anyone's freedom . When it gets dark, we will proceed to ask for identification papers; we will stop and check vehicles, which is normal in this type of situation . However, at no time will we paralyze production or normal daily activities . We are trying to find the culprits responsible for this attack . regardless of whether it was an attack against U.S. citizens, it was certainly an attack against peace and order . We therefore have to investigate it, regardless of whether or not it involved U.S. citizens . In this case, and in view of this situation, I personally issued orders and followed the investigation until 0500, when I suspended all operations . I personally ordered these measures . I am amazed that the cattlemen do not transport milk before 0500 . One last question on this matter: is the situation in La Ceiba related to the latest violent incidents in San Pedro Sula? I believe so . a series of criminal actions has been launched against social peace in Honduras . This station's listeners and listeners of all other Honduran radio stations know the high - caliber of the armed forces personnel, beginning with the top commanders and continuing with officers down the chain of command . We are sensitive to social Isses and are not motivated by vested interests of any kind . I believe that these acts of bloodshed, which are, are part of a series of fully planned, coldly Calulated actions . I do not want to sound like a comic strip character, but I believe that these actions are connected and overlap . I have the impression that . We are witnessing the emergence of the so-called white hands and black hands, which concern us very much . We are talking about Hondurans killing Hondurans . Thank you very much for your kindness to this station . We will be contacting you during the next few hours to learn the results of the investigations into this homemade bomb attack in La Ceiba . We are completely at your service . We are willing to offer you information as it comes in . We are a completely open, not closed, organization . We will give you truthful, factual information for the benefit of all Hondurans . Thank you and good morning, Colonel."

We also attacked the main supply center facilities and stormed three defensive positions in the interior . as a result of this attack, four of the enemy were killed and five were wounded . In addition, we destroyed the offices and a grain dryer and damaged the storage bins and grain storage areas . We concluded the attack by setting the entire facility on fire .

One hour after the attack began, the enemy was reinforced by a Rocket-Firing helicopter, one Push-Pull O-2 aircraft, and one C-47 aircraft . In addition, the enemy received artillery support from the areas above the installations under attack, but this fire and the air support were ineffective . The C-47 aircraft Strafed Las Penas, with complete disregard for the civilian population, a repressive action we vehemently denounce . later, at 0300, the enemy troops were reinforced by two armored personnel carriers and four military trucks, which took troops to a place near the IRA installation . These reinforcements were quickly neutralized by our rifle fire . In addition, the operation included a large number of Militiamen and rebel troops, who erected roadblocks on the streets of Nueva Concepcion, blew up six telephone posts, placed a large Banner across the street, and distributed propaganda . Other propaganda activities occurred in San Jose Patares, La Siembre, Guayabito, and Horcones in La Palma Jusrisdiction . In all, we inflicted 24 casualties, including dead and wounded, on the 4TH infantry Brigade; however, we lost comrade Otoniel in the attack."

We do not know who the kidnappers are . We are working on this . have you stepped up surveillance in the area? has finding the station wagon given you any clues? Yes, of course, we are looking into this . The Colombian police have the information and are working based on this . What about a ransom? has the Venezuelan government been contacted? there has been no contact . We are hoping there will be a contact so that we can proceed from there . is it true a ransom has been demanded? I have no proof of that . I do not have that information . What is the most recent information the Venezuelan government has received? we were briefed on the work being coordinated with the Colombian authorities . We are working very closely with them, like Brothers . The two armies and the authorities are working together . If a ransom is demanded, is the government willing to pay it? I cannot answer that question; that would depend on Rodriguez' family . The Colombian government has much experience with kidnappings . What do they say about this case? What do they think the outcome will be? We always work based on our experience with similar cases . This kidnapping could have been carried out by the rebels, and we already know how the rebels operate . He also could have been kidnapped by common criminals . Even though it may seem that the case would be handled similarly in both instances, it is not so . We are going to wait a bit longer . We believe we may get more information today . It is not Venezuelan government policy to pay ransom in cases such as this one . will an exception be made in this case? I believe we should follow our policy . There are means that can be used to reach an understanding; this would happen once we have specific information."

According to some reports, the students held a demonstration late in the afternoon to demand that the government withdraw troops from the University area and release students who had been arrested . after the Demonstation ended, explosions were heard and soldiers began shooting from different locations around the University . After dark, soldiers entered the University campus and began firing randomly and the sound of exploding Molotov Cocktails could be heard across the campus, which caused panic among the students."
297,DEV-MUC3-0298,SANTIAGO,1989-07-18,"Interior Minister Carlos Caceres today stated that the Gang-Style action Aken yesterday by some people to occupy private property will not intimidate the government . yesterday, a well-organized group of approximately 300 people attempted to usurp private property using Molotov Cocktails, stones and firearms . their action caused one unfortunate death, injuries, and damage--which were reported earlier--to the detriment of a large number of poor families . It is publicly evident that the Communists and their closest allies were behind the preparation, coordination and execution of these criminals actions . Unfortunately, one cannot fail to link these actions to the threatening, violent speeches--following the style used by the popular unity members--with which some leaders of the opposition coalition opened the electoral campaign of their candidate Patricio Aylwin . It is even possible to regard these aggressions as signals and warnings of the inconsistencies and contradictions that exist within some political umbrella groups . These groups consist of sectors advocating a peaceful Democratic coexistence on the one hand, and other sectors that follow the line of those who in the past destroyed our traditional way of life on the other hand . Although the government has stated its decision not to get involved in the political campaign, it cannot fail to announce its position and to state its outright rejection of a malicious and Demagogical rhetoric that poses a threat to public tranquillity . Under no circumstances will the government yield to those who time and again seek and promote subversion and to disrupt our democratic institutional order."

The clashes that occurred near the University were carried out by armed forces troops alone . in an effort to search the university, the troops fired their weapons as student demonstrators were entering the campus . 3 . This action is part of a plan the Cristiani government and the top command of the armed forces are promoting against El Salvador University . This plan is being carried out by Colonel Francisco Elena Fuentes, commander of the 1ST infantry Brigade . The plan involves threats, arrests, murders, and other repressive acts . 4 . It is predictable that the Cristiani government and the top command of the armed forces will say that what occurred at the University was the result of a clash between the Army and the Fmln, and this is completely false . Cristiani's government and the armed forces are solely responsible for the violent incidents that claimed several victims in the area around El Salvador University."

These incidents have not resulted in any deaths, although several people have been injured . The President said that the incidents at the University are part of a broader plan to provoke the 1ST Brigade troops patrolling the area . However, the President added, there will be no military intervention at the university, even if the soldiers who are surrounding the campus are provoked . Two students who were arrested last week and who were presented by the Treasury police have admitted their participation in leftist, destabilizing groups' activities . one of the students arrested is Luis Osvaldo Sandoval, a fifth - grade student at the Jose Matias Salgado school, who admitted being a member of the bread, land, work, and freedom movement and that he has participated in activities such as writing messages and pasting propaganda on walls and burning vehicles . The second student arrested is Ramon Parada Garcia, a 2d - year student at the, who said that he is a member of the Erp . The two youths said that they joined these organizations because they are paid on a monthly basis, explaining that their families have no other source of income .

As we reported earlier, the IRI was once part of the patriotic civil defense in San Salvador, which has since been disbanded . We have found out that he was about to enter a shop when he was shot at five times at least; we have been able to confirm that only three bullets actually struck him . One hit him in the back, another in the abdominal region, and one in the throat--a total of three bullets hit him . following an operation, doctors expect him to live; however, thus far no detailed medical report has been issued."

Most radio and television stations have transmission towers on that mountain because it towers over a vast area of Guatemala . It has been learned that a man, who is believed to have been the Watchman at channel 7's tower, was killed by the bomb . The spokesmen said that rescue units sent to the site have yet to return to the capital . The explosion was felt in several nearby communities and in a sector of Guatemala city . channel 7 suddenly went off the air just as Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo was about to deliver a speech . Nevertheless, the speech was broadcast by the other four television channels that operate in Guatemala . This terrorist action comes in the wake of a series of incidents that have occurred in the past few days as a result of strikes by teachers, post office workers, Finance Ministry employees, and other sectors demanding wage increases . a bomb was found before it exploded in a bank in the afternoon of 19 July, and several anonymous callers warned about other terrorist bombs last night; however, these turned out to be false alarms."

The Armed Forces, through its commander, General Humberto Regalado Hernandez, responded immediately by stating that``the only real Communists left in the world are Hondurans, because they are changing in other countries""and are no longer exploding bombs . The military leader asked people to attach no significance to the incident and said that should the wave of political violence continue, leftist groups would have to be called to a dialogue to avoid other similar actions .

The former University Rector said that this policy of terror, which has recently been intensified, tries to make people believe that there is a subversive cell that is destabilizing the country prior to the holding of the central American Presidential summit in Tela, Atlantida Department . The people's leaders said that``the terrorism of the Honduran democratic state is also shown by an electoral process that is extensively controlled by the agency for International development and the execution of poor Hondurans by repressive forces that have been trained by U.S . experts .""they said the terrorism is also Demostrated in the Nonfulfillment of the Esquipulas II peace agreements, by a policy that Capitulates to the IMF and the World Bank, the maintenance of extreme security, and the facilities given to the the Contras and the U.S. Army . After making the previous analysis, the Futh and the Ccop asked the government to halt state terrorism and to bring to justice those responsible for the political crimes against the people's leaders . They also demanded that the peace agreements be respected, that the National reconciliation Commission's report on repression be made known, and that the Nicaraguan Contras be Demobilized . They also proposed that the state carry out a real policy of democratization with the people's participation in the face of pressure from the IMF, the World Bank, and the U.S. Embassy .

The rebels used explosives to blow up 1 meter of pipeline . This is the rebels' 33d attack against the country's oil network in 1989 . The authorities reported that there was no oil spill because at the time of the attack, no oil was being pumped through the pipeline . a woman who said she was speaking on behalf of the Uc-Eln called the CALI media to claim responsibility for the attack . The Uc-Eln is attacking Colombia's oil pipelines as a way to pressure the government to nationalize the oil industry and to sign more favorable contracts with multinational oil companies . This year alone, the Uc-Eln launched 25 attacks on the Cano Limon-Covenas oil pipeline, the longest in Colombia . The attacks on the Cano Limon- Covenas pipeline have caused approximate $150 million in damage . If the six attacks on the Pacific oil pipeline and the two on the Dina-Salgar oil pipeline are taken into consideration, losses amount to approximately $200 million . The Dina-Salgar pipeline carries crude oil from the oil fields in Tolima to the refinery in Barrancabermeja."
306,DEV-MUC3-0307,SAN SALVADOR,1989-07-20,"Salvadoran people: I address you on this occasion to give you my first report on the state of the country . I make this report 50 days after assuming power . at this time I want to tell you the truth; I want tell you exactly what our situation is so that we will all understand what we must do in the future . Every Salvadoran must share in the sacrifice and effort . those of us who have a bit must show solidarity with those who have nothing or very little . The situation is critical, but we must confront it . that is why we have a government: to solve problems . We are willing to do this responsibly, because we know that doing nothing would mean a greater crisis for the Salvadoran people and would sink our homeland even deeper in the black abyss . We know that there are many concerns; we have heard different groups asking that the government state what it is planning to do to solve the problems . I would like to state, however, that we prefer to act calmly, study the problem in depth, and find a solution that will truly solve the problem . We would rather do this than make a rash decision and make a mistake . This is a truly difficult task . because I want to tell you in all honesty what is happening in the country, I wish to touch on the three major areas that create concern and that I feel the Salvadoran people should know about . First, let us talk about peace . Since this government was sworn and indiscriminate murders . There is no reason for this, because on 1 June we expressed our resolve to sit down and talk to find a peaceful solution to the conflict . The Fmln's response, however, has been more violence . We know many groups complain about the violence and insecurity; they have every reason to complain . The Armed Forces are willing to do all they can to protect everyone . They have been doing this in the past days, especially in those areas where the terrorist attacks have been stronger . The Armed Forces have been criticized many times and by many groups, especially those groups that in one way or another share the Fmln's ideas . They claim that the armed forces act in a repressive manner . dear Salvadoran people, let us analyze what really is happening in our country . The Armed Forces' duty is to control all those situations in which the law is broken . The Armed Forces are responsible for maintaining public order . The Armed Forces only take action when there are groups that only create violence and disrupt public order . The Armed Forces do not take action just because they want to take action . We have an armed forces to defend the Salvadoran people and never to attack the Salvadoran people . Therefore, what we must do is look around and see who is refusing to make a commitment and who is refusing to sit down, in a rational and peaceful manner, to find a solution to this conflict that no longer has a place in our history . Therefore, I would like to repeat what we, as a government, said on 1 June . on that day we expressed our willingness to sit down and talk . I would like to discuss this a bit, because there have been misunderstandings over our intentions in this dialogue."
307,DEV-MUC3-0308,SAN SALVADOR,,"Smuggling can be held in check only with measures such as these . We have already begun to take the Severest actions against those who smuggle merchandise into our country . an investigation is well under way into a corporation which has been smuggling merchandise into our country . those responsible for this will soon be brought to trial in accordance with the law . We want to warn all those who somehow have smuggled or who are planning to smuggle that they should stop this activity . We believe that smuggling constitutes corruption and that corruption is a crime of high treason . We cannot allow corruption in our country . We will take harsh actions against every type of corruption, including smuggling . I am asking those who might be approached by unscrupulous individuals who have in their possession smuggled goods to refrain from purchasing those products . Let us not promote smuggling . I am asking all good Salvadoran businessmen not to purchase any smuggled goods . smuggling constitutes an attack against our homeland and encourages corruption, which must be eradicated from our country . regarding our fiscal policy, we must try to determine ways to more directly make up for the difference between revenue and disbursements in the country . We believe that we can bridge this fiscal deficit in two ways--we must either increase our revenue or lower our disbursements . This government has already taken austerity measures regarding the latter . The government has determined not only to maintain expenditures at the current level, but to reduce them by 15 percent . We want to make clear that our government's austerity measures must be genuine and should be aimed at making more efficient use of scant resources . This is why we are asking public employees to understand that if the government is to be more efficient, the government must provide better services for the Salvadoran people . After all, it is the people who pay our salaries and provide the revenue that allows the government to operate . We must spend our money wisely . All public officials and employees must guard against corruption . We must take pains to serve the population and to improve the quality of the services that the people are receiving and deserve . only when the government is run efficiently, when its actions are crystal clear, when the government Rids itself of corruption, and when the money that the taxpayers pay is used for the good of the people, will we be able to elicit a positive reaction from the taxpayers . They have to pay taxes . When taxes are squandered, misused, or stolen, no one will pay them willingly . If we, as the government, act honestly, serve the nation well, and implement programs to benefit the majority, only disloyal Salvadorans will be unwilling to pay taxes."
308,DEV-MUC3-0309,SAN SALVADOR,,"Second, the Salvadoran people's health . We believe that in the very short term, we had to supply all the health facilities and hospitals with at least the most urgently needed medicines for the people . We have allotted 17 million Colons for the health Ministry for the purchase of the most urgently needed medicines and for the distribution of this medicine throughout the country so that the poor will receive the efficient health services that the government must provide . The education Ministry has been asked to give students the materials they need to pursue their studies . a certain amount of money has been allotted for the purchase of equipment needed by the schools . When the 1990 school year begins, we must be prepared to provide the schools and students with the material they need . We also believe that it is necessary to begin, as soon as possible, repairing the streets and roads . The Salvadoran people can see that this is already being done . Finally, low-income housing . next week the public works Minister will announce the low-income housing plan, and he will explain how we will help low-income families buy homes . This will be done through a subsidy plan ensuring that low-income groups will not be affected by steep payments and will have money left over for food and other basic necessities . We have already drafted a social emergency plan . This plan will be implemented in September, and its first phase will be carried out in the highly populated urban areas . The plan will benefit approximately 200 communities and, as of now, I ask the mayors for their help, because we want to work with the municipal governments . This first phase will be aimed at providing low-income communities with public utilities . We will provide them with electricity and running water, we will build sewer systems, and we will help them improve their health and nutrition . amid the crisis we are experiencing, we believe that it is necessary to support the small - scale businessmen in these communities . We will organize a loan system for small - size businesses for development within these communities . I repeat: this social emergency plan will be implemented in September . in the next few weeks, we will begin to seek the cooperation of those municipal governments that will be involved in the plan . There is something else that we must all struggle for, and that is to abolish unemployment . We must struggle so that every Salvadoran will have the chance to earn an honest living . We therefore wish to launch an offensive against unemployment . We also believe that the best way to fight violence is through employment opportunities, so that the people will not find themselves in the situation where they believe that they must commit crimes to survive or that they must get involved in the type of violence sponsored by the Fmln terrorists . Therefore, in September, we will also implement an emergency plan to generate employment . This plan has some specific goals: first, to provide a basic job for those persons who are unemployed or underemployed . Our goal is to create 20,000 jobs per month for these people . This plan will be drafted in the next few weeks, and we will implement it during those months when there is usually a drop in employment . I must stress that we are not going to implement the plan during the sowing and harvest seasons, because during those seasons there is an Overabundance of jobs."
309,DEV-MUC3-0310,SAN SALVADOR,1989-07-22,"The Salvadoran national police reported this morning that unidentified men set off bombs at the central American Jose Simeon Canas University, Uca, located in southwestern San Salvador . According to the report, the attack took place at 0200 . One administrative office, one bus, and one electrical transformer were damaged as a result of the explosion of at least four bombs that went off inside the Uca campus . The Armed Forces have always condemned this kind of attack, which is usually carried out by certain groups that oppose peace . The Armed Forces believe that such attacks are not the way to solve the country's social and political problems . In addition, these violent actions only confuse the public, because unscrupulous people always blame the Army for any such action, without first conducting an in-depth investigation of the origin of the attacks . The Armed Forces have always reiterated their willingness to ensure respect for human rights, public and private property, and the life and safety of the Salvadoran people . Therefore, from this very moment, the armed forces reject any accusation Implicating them in the attack against Uca, which took place early this morning."

We have categorically said that we will not turn back the agrarian reform process . quite to the contrary, we want to fully support it in order to guarantee that peasants in areas affected by the agrarian reform are free to choose the kind of property ownership that best suits their needs, in accordance with the great freedoms guaranteed in the Constitution and laws of the Republic . Our government is determined to work hard to ensure that our brother peasants are indeed benefited by the agrarian reform and that they will not be used as a Demagogical Banner at the service of political ideology, as was the case until recently . We want peasants' welfare to be the objective of our agrarian reform; we want agrarian reform to develop within a legal, honest, and patriotic framework . We are against the Demagoguery of static paternalism, because we want peasants to determine their own fate, to truly participate in their production units' decisionmaking process, in the marketing of their products, and in the distribution of revenue . It is neither fair nor correct, as has been the case in the past, to benefit office workers, who have never sweated in the fields under the agrarian reform, when you--the peasants--are now facing debts and are worse off than before you owned land . Our government and you will gradually change this situation to ensure that you will enthusiastically work your land, knowing that the fruit of your labor will directly benefit your families . We are sure that with efficient organization, prompt credit, adequate technical assistance, and the hardworking legacy of the Salvadoran people, we will turn the agrarian reform into an opportunity for economic and social development, which will benefit all Salvadorans by promoting production and productivity . dear peasants: we wish to take advantage of this opportunity to tell you that our government is determined to work with you . through the relevant organizations, the government will implement programs to completely upgrade the Salvadoran peasants' conditions . through Finata, we will continue to finance the acquisition of more land for distribution among thousands of peasant families . dear friends: our government is determined to achieve peace, because we are aware that the Fmln's terrorist violence Disturbs the calm and normal procedure of rural activities; we realize that we must end the violence so that we can all go back to work and bring about a national recovery . peasants have suffered the most throughout the conflict unleashed by the terrorist Marxist-Leninist groups, and we believe that the time has come to seek the peace that we all want in order to restore social harmony, mutual respect, and Fraternal love among all Salvadorans without exception . on behalf of the government of the Republic, we have been particularly pleased to present these permanent land title deeds to the beneficiaries of decree 207 . We congratulate and invite you to continue working together to help the Fatherland recover from the crisis and to build for our children and all Salvadorans a future of peace, justice, liberty, and progress."

312,DEV-MUC3-0313,BUENOS AIRES,1989-07-28,"Good evening ladies and gentlemen . Today we will discuss the foreign debt problem . This subject could perhaps seem a bit out place at a time when more troublesome matters affect all Argentine families, such as high public utility rates, prices, controls, difficulties, etc . However, we must attend to the foreign debt problem because most our difficulties come from it . of what does this problem consist? We currently owe $64 billion . This represents a burden of $6 billion yearly in interest payments . Since Argentina is currently exporting $9 billion annually, and if we paid $6 billion in interest, we would only have $3 billion left annually to attend to all our national needs, that is, the needs of industry, Commerce, etc . Obviously this is not enough money, and we cannot pay $6 billion in interest each year with $9 billion worth of annual exports . This is not new . This is a heavy inheritance, which originated not in the recent past but more than 10 years ago . When Martinez de Hoz became economy Minister, the foreign debt amounted to $9 billion . When he concluded his term, the debt amounted to $29 billion . The military governments that came after him dragged the debt along and increased it to $44 billion which they passed to President Alfonsin . Alfonsin's administration increased the debt by an additional $20 billion . So today our debt amounts to $64 billion . This is not all . We ceased honoring our commitments abroad . We have not even paid interest since April last year . We have only made token payments . This Refutes the ideas of those who say: Let us stop paying our debt and use the resources to make the country grow . We are not paying anything . for more than a year we have not been paying anything, and not only has the economy not grown, but it shrank . Argentina has an extremely low credit rating . countries are internationally classified by their credit, and we are in one of the lowest categories . Our commercial credit is also being curtailed . commercial credits are the ones that allow us to import, export, and meet our daily needs . When the new administration assumed power on 8 April 1989, the central bank's foreign reserves were exhausted . This situation can turn into a crisis at any moment . We cannot continue like this . the coming of this new government, which has brought about positive expectations and hope, and which is undertaking remarkable changes--mainly changes of mentality--has stopped the crisis from exploding . But we cannot rest on our achievements . We must face this problem immediately . Our starting point in certainly very uncomfortable . our country has no prestige abroad; we have lost our credibility . No one even wants to hear about Argentina, or at least about its debt . in the past few years we have not honored any of our Commietments . every time we signed a letter of intent with the IMF, we knew that we could not comply with it . There have been several letters of intent we did not comply with . What policy will we follow in the future? the President defined it in his message to Congress on 8 July . He said we have a heavy burden, a debt that was unwisely contracted, but it is a commitment of honor . He used words that were common in Argentina in the past . It was once said: We will comply with our commitments, even at the cost of hunger and thirst for the Argentine people . The President has made his own commitment on this subject . We will pay according to the capability of the nation, and the only thing we require is a bit of time and, of course, flexibility on the part of our creditors . If we did not honor our commitments, if we had said we are not going to pay, the situation in our country would be dramatically worse . We would be isolated . We would not be able to obtain credits, we would not be able to obtain foreign capital investments . in a word, we would not be able to integrate the rest of the world, which is quickly expanding and progressing . We would be much more backward than we are today . Therefore there is really no question of paying or not paying . The honor of the country is at stake . What is the role of the foreign debt in our economic recovery? you know that we have everything necessary . We have natural resources, food, energy, fishing, mining, etc . We have human resources . You know that when Argentines work abroad they are efficient and they are recognized as such . We have no internal religious, racial, or Indian problems, not even problems with our neighbors . What are we missing? Why are we where we are, and why can't we survive? we need two things: first, we need an appropriate economic order . We live in a deep economic and social disorder . Second, we need capital . capital is absolutely necessary . I said that I was going to discuss the savings in Argentina that can be tapped . for years, Argentina's savings have been constantly punished by government actions, such as abusive taxes, mandatory savings, and, above all, the great erosion caused by inflation that destroys the currency . Just remember how many times we have changed our currency . to protect themselves from these losses, what did savers do? they either took their money abroad or hid it under their mattresses . We will focus today on the money under the mattresses, although what I will say now will also be relevant for those who have their savings abroad . According to calculations, there are small, medium, and large savings adding up to nearly $5 billion in the country . a person was assaulted in Cordoba the other day and $250,000 was found in his Mattress . MONEY under the Mattress is at risk, does not accrue interest, does not work for the country, and does not give any benefit to the owners nor the country . Some of our hope lies in these savings inside and outside of the country, because they represent a reserve that we have on hand . We are not bankrupt . We have those reserves, although they are not working . The secret is to use them for the country's benefit . Argentina's problems can be resolved if these savings are used . Now, to tap into these savings, the government has made a decision, and the central bank has already translated it into a resolution . into banks here in the country in dollars, yen, Deutsche marks, or any other currency . They will be able to make withdrawals whenever they want in the same currency in which their savings were deposited . Nobody will be allowed to touch them . This will be reinforced by a law granting savers the maximum guarantee that no public power can intervene in those savings; that is, there will be a financial system into which those savings, in any currency, can be placed for the benefit of the country and, of course, the Depositor . anybody who has $10,000 under his Mattress can take it out, go to the bank, and, under the guarantee of the bank--not the central bank or the nation, which have been discredited--the money will be at his disposal at any time . The bank will lend the money for export operations and for moving the country's wealth . New blood will thus have been injected into the Argentine financial system . I point out that the law will give maximum guarantees . No public power will have the right to seize the savings, nor freeze them, nor postpone their withdrawal . These are the maximum guarantees that can be given; more is impossible . Each Argentine must now think about what this means . It has a crucial importance, because it injects blood into the social body; it moves the country . Moreover, from the moral standpoint, if we do not do this, how can we go abroad and ask foreigners to invest in Argentina--to bring their money to Argentina--if at the same time I do not invest here because I do not have confidence in my country? this is an immoral position . If we make the initial effort and deposit $2 , 3 or 4 billion in the country, our negotiations abroad take a new twist, because we can say that the Argentines have made the first effort . all this naturally depends on confidence, and confidence in turn depends on taking this first step . This is a reciprocal effect . to create confidence, measures such as those adopted by the government and the central bank have to be adopted . These measures create confidence, and with confidence the country will quickly recover . We have many other things to say about this, but within the limitation of time, we can stop here."
313,DEV-MUC3-0314,LIMA,1989-07-28,"Mr president of Congress, gentlemen members of the National Congress: ten years ago, the members of the constituent assembly presided over by Haya de la Torre, calling up on Lord God for strength and in keeping with the powers vested in us by the sovereign will of the people, approved the national Constitution . We believe that the human being comes first and that all honorable people have universally valid rights . Thus we decided to work for a free and just society and for the development of a democratic state based on popular will and on the free, periodic consultation of this will . We bet on civilized coexistence as a way of launching a process based on stable and legitimate institutions . The most important conditions, however, were set forth in Chapter 1, which recognized the individual's basic rights and duties for the free development of his personality . Our Constitution was a result of the balance achieved among various and sometimes antagonistic political forces . Thus, some of its economic articles may seem vague . However, under this Constitution any ideology can govern the country and make changes in any direction whatsoever, as long as those first conditions agreed upon by consensus are respected . This is the last message I will deliver to Congress as President before I turn the Presidency over to a citizen elected by the people . I cannot fail to expand on the achievements made this year, which, honestly speaking are much fewer than in previous years . I am delivering a summary of these achievements in writing, as establish by the Constitution, for the use of the legislators . It is a summary of material achievements . It is now more important to me to say that the main objective of the government in the next 12 months will be to reaffirm the system of democratic freedom, which is the most important system Peru has . with this freedom, even the most extreme positions can exist . The reactionary positions of the Ultraright and radical ideologies can also live in freedom . violence has less chance of developing in freedom . the nation has more legitimate means to eradicate violence under freedom . like any other citizen, I also believe that sometimes disagreements, political parties, laws, and skillful legal procedures can obstruct many things and stop decisions . But this is the price for a civilized lifestyle . democracy does not have the forthrightness of a dictatorship . democracy is slower, but demands more firmness, more conviction, more patience . democracy demands the gradual education of the people; This takes a long time . I am saying this because the country has been suffering a dramatic economic crisis since September 1988, and it has been necessary to make harsh changes at a time when violence has seemed to increase . We heard some people who had lost their cool demanding an interruption of our democracy . They called for a shorter government term . They also said that the country could defeat the terrorist violence and the economic crisis by restricting freedom and establishing an authoritarian regime . I believe that those were immature voices, deceitful temptations . Many of those voices Unfortunately came from people who have more wealth . by doing this they have shown that they are not yet ready to coexist democratically and to accept that social and economic tensions, even at the worse times, should be handled with serenity and patience . A dictatorship that violates legal procedures will only help to increase violence and legitimate insurgency, and would stimulate the creation of new subversive groups . A dictatorship cannot solve the economic crisis . It would only have limited power and would impose a traumatic experience that would lead nowhere . I am referring to this issue because the next 12 months will be a crucial period . I call on the Peruvian people to look at the future of our democracy by realizing that in a democracy the problems are solved with more democracy, with more freedom, and with more participation . to have democracy, one must have a great deal of patience . This is my last message to Congress . I am committed to more freedom and more freedom of expression, which sometimes we doubt because of excesses . But freedom of expression will always be positive, because without freedom of expression abuse will prevail."

The Codeh President also revealed that the Battalion 3-16's new name is the Counterinsurgency Battalion and its commander is Colonel Alberto Andino Benitez . Custodio said this during the news conference he held 2 August . We have called this news conference because we want to warn the people, the foreign journalists who are here, and the other central American Presidents about the atmosphere of insecurity which Afflicts the Honduran people . First of all, we will mention the assassinations which occurred in July at San Pedro Sula: Eduardo Herrera, Salomon Vallecillo, and Dr Ramon Roberto Garay . We believe that the assassinations were perpetrated by professionals so we would like a judge to call the new commander of Battalion 3-16--now called Counterinsurgency Battalion--Colonel Alberto Andino Benitez to testify .

Dr Marco Antonio Bogran was taken with all his household employees to the DNI and held from 0800 to 1500 . He was not allowed to call his lawyer or his relatives, and he was held in isolation . He was naturally afraid the worst would happen . No one explained anything until the end . He was told that someone had reportedly made a subversive phone call from his house . This means that his telephone is being illegally tapped because no one here has the right to control anyone's calls . The military men in charge of Hondutel illegally abuse their power when they hear and control telephone calls because this should be handled by the civilian authorities . Colonel Manuel Enrique Suarez Benavides, chief of the armed forces public relations office, has reacted to Custodio Lopez' statement . I have heard part of Ramon Custodio's news conference on Codeh foreign policy, and we observed his animosity toward the Contras and his affection for the Farabundo Marti National liberation front in El Salvador . We thought he only handled human rights but we see He also Delves in foreign policy . However, this is not the main issue . I want to refer to the fact that years ago we publicly proved that Battalion 3-16, which he mentioned so many times, had been dismantled so the unit no longer exists . Nevertheless, he seems to have forgotten this, or he may be intentionally forgetting this . The unit disappeared but the Counterintelligence Battalion he mentions does exist and its commander, which he mentions, is a member of the armed forces . In other words, he has absolutely nothing to do with the activities that Battalion 3-16 reportedly carried out . If Custodio wants it, we can send him a copy of the agreements to dismantle Battalion 3-16 and to appoint the current commander of the Counterintelligence Battalion, which has existed for many years . that is all . I wanted to clarify this and I hope Dr Custodio is more objective in his statements . I sometimes believe that the problem of being on one side the mind . Colonel, when will the armed forces be able to give the Honduran people exact information on the latest people who have been reported missing in our country? excuse me, I can hardly hear you . I asked: When can the Honduran people have exact information on the people who have been reported missing in the country? look, we believe that we will shortly, and I am talking about a short time, have enough information for the Honduran people on the persons you have mentioned because the investigations continue . The police arrest people based on the suspicion or hard, rational evidence that they are involved in criminal actions . I believe you will soon have enough information on the persons who have been arrested by the police."

The Flmn recently met with the legally registered political parties in El Salvador . The Fmln has met with social groups, and, after these talks, they made a specific proposal: to begin a dialogue to reach a negotiated solution to the conflict that the Salvadoran people are enduring . Our desire is to support a negotiated solution--as established in the Esquipulas agreements - - to find a negotiated solution to this kind of central American conflict."

The Detainees were members of a cell that transported weapons to the Farabundo Marti National liberation front in northern El Salvador from northern Nicaragua through Eastern, central, and Western Honduras . The guerrillas, who also transported medical equipment, literature, and food, ran small businesses in Honduras that served as``fronts ,""a military source said . According to Honduran Army spokesman Colonel Manuel Enrique Suarez, the Detainees are in court custody, and 71 Ak-47 rifles, Ramrods, bayonets, and other equipment have been presented as proof against them . Col Suarez confirmed the existence of``several other groups that we are investigating with a view to dismantling them .""the officer said that it had not been proven if the weapons are supplied to the Salvadoran guerrillas by the Cuban government through the Nicaraguan government``because so far we only know that the weapons are transported from Nicaragua to El Salvador through Honduras .

He said that U.S . soldiers permanently violate the Panama Canal treaties and frequently occupy unauthorized zones with tanks and soldiers . Solis Palma also said Panama has avoided Provocations so that the invaders cannot justify their actions, but in case of a confrontation, the people and the Panama defense forces are prepared to defend the national sovereignty . As for Panama's internal situation, Solis Palma said his government is determined to achieve an understanding with the opposition and other social and political groups so that a national unity government can be created based on the principle that the canal belongs to Panama and national sovereignty cannot be violated."

We have been seriously working on that agreement so that a final agreement can be issued . We have prepared documents on which, I would say, there is a certain consensus--such as on the document on the of the Contras, the document on the Honduran-Nicaraguan agreement concerning the suit Nicaragua has filed before the International Court of justice, the Salvadoran issue, and other points . I think there is a political resolve on the part of the central American Presidents to make sure that something positive emerges from this summit . I am sure that the U.S. government is hoping that nothing will result from this summit . I would not be surprised if the U.S. government is currently exerting strong pressures so that nothing will come from this summit . Mr President: What are the procedures for Nicaragua's withdrawal of its suit against Honduras? this has to be linked to complete compliance with the plan for the Contra withdrawal . In other words, the Contras must first leave? of course . that is our insurance . Mr President, has Honduras agreed to this? we are exchanging viewpoints on this . The suit represents an insurance for you, commander? which groups has the United States been pressuring? the central American groups . There have been direct and indirect contacts . The United States has contacted the central American delegations in hopes that no agreement will be reached . The Americans continue to favor the presence of the Contras . The fact that President Bush met with Contra leaders on the eve of this central American Presidents summit is a slap in the face to this meeting . When you mention these pressures, Mr President, to which countries are you referring? all of them, with the exception of Nicaragua . I have no doubts that right now the United States is exerting pressure, because it wants to kill this summit just when we are about to reach an agreement . If no agreement is reached at this summit, the United States will be responsible for that . because we Central American countries have sufficient authority and sufficient self-determination and independence to decide our own actions . at this stage, how would you describe the Presidents summit? is this summit a failure or a success? I think it has to be a success, even if the United States has not given up trying to make it fail . This is the time, and I am sure that it is trying."

However, he said that the position of the Fmln will actually be very critical now . The Fmln will not look good internationally if it rejects the dialogue . Here is an excerpt of D'Aubuisson's statements, in which he also revealed that Costa Rican President Oscar Arias has offered to Mediate the dialogue ....Fallacies . This is not the first time they have claimed to want something and ended up doing something different . They are going to try to improve their international image and do not want to look like before the little Mangy-Dogs who go about planting bombs here . They want to demonstrate perhaps that they always hold a Hegemonic position here and will try to obtain a better negotiating position for their illegal forces, which are still going around and killing people . Nevertheless, major, do you view this meeting as positive with the Fmln--that is, the dialogue--now that something tangible has come out of the summit? do you think peace can be achieved? the objective of all Salvadorans--and in this regard we speak from the heart--is to achieve peace . If the Fmln cooperates, we welcome its cooperation . However, if it does not cooperate, there will be Fmln members who will Demobilize, the same way so many people from the are Deserting . These people had to be given guarantees . We will see later if, as they say, they are truly working, or struggling, for the Salvadoran people more positive actions . However, we see everything as being well on the way to achieving peace in a short time . D'Aubuisson said that if the Fmln does not agree to the demobilization, the Fmln members will be solely responsible if peace is not achieved . regarding the Commission, he said it is already being organized and will begin a dialogue soon ....a continuous dialogue to find solutions . that is why President Cristiani has instructed that it have no prior agenda but that it just begin . their first step should be to sit down at a table to talk, to negotiate, to engage in dialogue . and this is to go on continuously until solutions are found and they achieve something tangible, which is the final solution . Well, for example, Costa Rican President Arias has offered to act as mediator or intermediary . He said that if the Commission goes to San Jose, he will take it upon himself to invite these gentlemen too and to give them whatever they need for this meeting to begin . After that, they themselves will develop the mechanisms . Maj D'Aubuisson said the Commission will be sworn in and will maintain an ongoing dialogue with the Fmln representatives . Commenting on legislative work, he said that today the political committee will meet to elect the President of the Commission on corruption, which had been substantially neglected by Dr Jaime Ventura .

338,DEV-MUC3-0339,BOGOTA,1989-08-07,"Simon bolivar and Francisco de Paula Santander gave our Armed forces the mission of defending freedom, independence, and democracy . Throughout history, the National Army has complied with that mandate . It has not been an easy task, even less so during the times we are living . very few nations have had to confront simultaneously so many difficult challenges . confronted by a combination of sources of disruption, the armed forces have not lost their Determiantion and optimism, nor have they stopped for 1 minute to struggle for the Reestablishment of tranquillity for the citizens, and for the protection of life, honor, and property of COLOMBIANS . as the violence increases, our commitment to democracy and Colombia is strengthened . The price of courage and firmness has been high . Many soldiers, officers, and noncommissioned officers have been killed, but they are the heroes of democracy . on the occasion of Army day, I speak on behalf of the vast national majority and convey to their families, friends, and fellow soldiers our message of encouragement, appreciation, and hope . their efforts have not been in vain . The battle to preserve democracy and defeat violence continues . The determination of COLOMBIANS does not weaken . Our enemies are alone, as never before, and this we owe to permanent actions by our Armed Forces . in the electoral campaign, I offered the COLOMBIANS a policy of reconciliation based on defined guidelines and clear principles . This was the Democratic mandate that we received from the people . Now, when we are harvesting the results of that strategy, we will not give up . The peace initiative has showed that it can operate and it will continue to be the framework within which we will conduct political action for national reconciliation . Some believe that to preserve democracy, it is necessary to leave it idle, at the mercy of violence . others argue that peace can only be achieved if we dismantle our capability to defend democracy . We do not agree . The government has confirmed that strengthening democracy and the quest for peace are not only compatible with improving and strengthening the armed forces, but that this is indispensable for advancing the political handling of violence . efficient, professional armed forces that serve the country are a definite guarantee of the rights of citizens and of peaceful coexistence . that is why this government has made a great administrative and financial effort to return to the military institutions complete freedom of action . This Commemoration of the 170th anniversary of our independence is a suitable time to ponder our duty to the homeland . I am not referring to daily civic duties, which are proper to all of us COLOMBIANS, but to something much deeper--loyalty to democracy and our institutions . democracy's boundaries are broad, but precise . When violence to a certain extent is tolerated, more violence is created, there is a conspiracy against peace, and conflicts are aggravated . the entire society has suffered because of the activities of the enemies of Colombia . I congratulate the officers, civilian personalities, Sergeant Amaya Alvarez, and private Malambo Tique, whose merits were acknowledged today in the name of their fellow countrymen and the government . This ceremony, in which we honor the heroes of independence and the Army, is a suitable occasion to make known to officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers alike the nation's recognition of their courageous and professional fulfillment of their duties . When the armed forces academies parade before us, so will the young men and women who have devoted their lives to serving the homeland and their fellow countrymen . Every honest Colombian supports them . soldiers: you, who wield the nation's arms, represent the basic guarantee that preserves sovereignty, liberty, and our democratic institutions . Thank you."

The spokesman told Efe that the soldiers arrested miners at the La Oroya, Morococha, Casa Palca, and Austria-Duvalz mining camps in the central part of the mountain range . In Lima, the police are looking for the main leaders of the miners . The Federation of miners and metalworkers has called a national strike for 14 August to pressure the courts into ruling in favor of a``single national list of demands ,""which will allow the Federation to represent all Peruvian miners at the discussions of labor and salary issues . On Friday , 11 August, the Peruvian government ordered Army soldiers and Navy marines to guard mining camps in order to prevent possible attacks and sabotage during the strike, the first this year . terrorists have attacked several mines lately and have killed approximately 12 miners, including Saul Cantoral, Secretary General of the Federation .

342,DEV-MUC3-0343,NO CITY ,,"Article 5 adds: all men from 18 to 50 years of age and women from 18 to 45 years of age are obliged to comply with this law, thus this period of life is called military age . This means that all 18- to 50-year-old Peruvians are of military age, and we are obliged to comply with the compulsory military service law, in the reserve . Therefore, one not only complies with the military service law when one is assigned on active duty to a military Garrison for 1 or 2 years, but one continues complying with this law by remaining in the Reserve until 50 years of age . article 272 of the military service law States: men from 18 to 50 years of age and women between 18 and 45 years of age who are not on active military service all belong to the reserve, and they must comply with the obligations established by clause 4 of this law . If the law States this, I then ask all Peruvians: are not terrorists--who are part of the armed forces reserves and who take arms to attack the national police and armed forces--violating the obligatory military service law? is not he, who by violent means tries to destroy the constitutional system of which the armed forces are part, violating the military service law? therefore, since article 282 of the Constitution States that those who violate the compulsory military service law can be tried by the military code of justice, then terrorists can be tried by military courts . Thus the idea is that one law, one article, should establish that the crime of terrorism violates the military service law, therefore enabling a quick and drastic punishment for terrorists . It will therefore not be necessary to Ammend the Constitution . A correct interpretation of the Constitution is all that will be needed . We must also remember that when the current Constitution was approved there was no serious terrorist problem . Besides, you must know that to Ammend the Constitution we must wait nearly 2 years, and we have no time to waste . Many Peruvians think that if military courts try terrorists they will be sentenced to death . This is false, it is not correct . The military courts will only rule sentences in keeping with the law, but these sentences will be applied firmly . This means that criminals will not go unpunished . I ask all Peruvians and all institutions to support this proposal . terrorists must not remain unpunished . This does not mean that we do not trust the civilian courts . This means that we must simply interpret the Constitution appropriately . terrorists really do violate their condition as Armed Forces reserves when they take up arms against the government and the armed forces . It is therefore our purpose to do things correctly . The Constitution must be interpreted in favor of Peru, since it cannot be interpreted in favor of the terrorists . I am surprised that on the one side people criticize the little action taken against terrorists, while on the other they do not accept a concrete initiative like this one to punish them . This is the moment to resume the discussion on this subject before the election campaigns make us forget that we are at war against terrorism . on the contrary, in order to safeguard the elections we must quickly make all the important decisions and approve strict punishments that will allow us to live in democracy, freedom, peace, and safety .

Unfortunately, Luis Carlos Galan, the liberal party Presidential hopeful, was the victim of another attack tonight . Senator Galan has been taken to a hospital . Let us pray to God that he will recover from his wounds . The criminal organizations and the narcotics traffickers have unleashed a wave of assassinations and deaths . There have been attacks against representatives and leaders from all sectors of the country and from all institutions . High-Ranking government officials, several judges, political leaders, soldiers, citizens, and public officials have been the victims of this Barbarism . violence affects all . It is not an offensive against the government or against justice; it is a war against the country . Therefore, the entire country must respond . I can understand how the murder of magistrate Carlos Valencia led the judges of the Republic to protest and to request more protection, but for the magistrates and judges to resign only contributes to worsening the situation which we must all solve by working together . This is also equivalent to yielding to the terrorists who are trying to paralyze the administration of justice . true heroes such as Carlos Valencia, Waldemar Franklin Quintero, and other judges, policemen, soldiers, and Bodyguards have prevented this by fulfilling their duties without yielding to intimidation or bribery . I invite all judges of the Republic to resume their work . The government has adopted more measures to protect them, and it will continue to render all the cooperation they require and which is available . All good COLOMBIANS must join the efforts . no more lamentations without true action of cooperation with the authorities .

As for the media, whose role is essential in the maintenance of public order in the country, I would only state that the Constitution guarantees them full freedom in times of peace, but they will be held responsible before the law when they attack people's honor, social order, or public tranquillity . The government will then enforce those laws in accordance with the Constitution . based on special powers, today the government issued other decrees that the National Congress approved on a government request . I will mention only one of those decrees . This decree AMENDS our penal code . the public naming of jurors will be eliminated . organized crime took advantage of that jury appointment system and avoided the action of justice by Intimidating jurors . The new decree reduces formalities and creates roving judges who will have authority throughout the country, thus increasing the flexibility of the judicial system . Those judges will judge any crime that will be given special importance for reasons of public order . These measures have been carefully studied . that, however, does not mean they cannot be supplemented in the future if necessary . When drafting these decrees we, as usual, paid due attention to the honorable Supreme Court of Justice's decisions so that the current decrees follow along with the guidelines of the Constitution . The threat that drug traffickers and organized crime represent justifies the severity of the measures we have adopted . COLOMBIANS can be sure we will continue making all the necessary efforts to regain tranquillity in Colombia . I am sure we will overcome these difficulties . a handful of criminals will not defeat a unified nation that is willing to struggle against crime . We are certainly experiencing a difficult time . However, we have experienced even more difficult situations and Colombia overcame them . We must not stray from our path, because that is what the criminals want . by falling into despair we will be playing the terrorists' game . If we continue ahead firmly and decisively, we will have much better results . Instead of wasting our time in disputes and reciprocal reproaches, let us unite our actions against our common enemy . We must win this war . I am sure we will succeed . good evening and see you soon."

He is someone who is very familiar with that movement, and he does have credibility . The interesting aspect of this is the way this big Mangy dog, this Mr Villalobos, thinks . If he wants to come here and participate, we'll take his word, and let us see if he will really have a landslide victory . would there be any guarantees for his participation? didn't I just tell you that the first Mangy dogs, Ungo and Zamora, are already here? we do have the best of intentions; there is a willingness to do this . Now, if they actually want to do it, that is a different story . I am just telling you about the first indications we have had, in addition to some notes on the elections that have been sent by some who claim to be commanders . The overall picture has changed somewhat in the last few years . What is that change, major? in practically all of the notes they have sent, including the ones sent prior to the elections, they said that if the elections were postponed they would participate . that is an indication that they do have plans to join the process . What does this mean, major? it means two basic things: one, they are lost . The option to seize power through violent means no longer exists . In other words, they are lost in the military field? they are lost both in the military field and in the option to seize power through violent means . Second, they no longer have the support, and we have been analyzing that for some time now . There is no longer any support for this type of rebel movement, for this type of armed rebel movement to seize power . You mean support from the USSR? there is no support from the Communist world in general . Naturally, this is based very much on the so-called Perestroyka . Therefore, they will have to join the democratic process, because otherwise they are going to be left out . If they want to continue shooting bullets just for the sake of shooting, they are going to be left out of everything and everyone . There is much talk here about forming an internal opposition front; I believe this is part of the``everyone against arena""campaign . do you have any knowledge about this and the line this internal front might follow? well, not exactly . However, it is logical that an internal political front could be formed . that would be a political process within a democratic process . It is all right to do that . They have all the right in the world to do that . Now, there are subversive thoughts . We are referring to those big Mangy dogs who want to take the first steps in joining the democratic process . on the other hand, they are subversive individuals who are disrupting public order . If what they want is to cause harm and hinder the programs prepared by President Cristiani and his cabinet, they are going to go ahead and do it anyhow . remember that very simple phrase I told you at the beginning . They claim that if arena fails, they are the alternative . that is what the group of Ungo, Zamora, and all those really thinks . There is another great possibility, and that is what is really going to happen here: arena will not fail . The Salvadoran people will not fail . However, they are going to try all the illegal, subversive actions they can to make us fail."

There were reports that peasants were concerned because six cases had been decided in favor of the landowners and the lands were legally turned over to the owners . I do not know if there were six or more cases . If we look at it from the legal point of view, serious mistakes were made when the lands were violently occupied . Many lands were improperly occupied . We have to look at the political aspects of this . We are looking for solutions for these people . If they cannot stay on those lands, they can take other lands, because there are about 33 land tracts that have been completely abandoned . refugees and Army families may be brought to those regions . Even those who disagree with our agrarian reform plan can go there . No one will be abandoned . where are those 33 land tracts? in different parts of the country . In general terms, and to end this interview, do you believe this 5-Year period will be one of peace and development in El Salvador? Yes, and we are sure that we will win the elections in the first round in 1994 . In this 5-Year period we will enjoy the benefits of having an honest government and of being able to express ourselves democratically . There will be productivity and the people of El Salvador will once again feel proud of being Salvadorans . We will no longer need others to donate things to us because we can produce them here .

374,DEV-MUC3-0375,NO CITY ,1989-08-25,"You must know better than I that the Israeli government itself, and not only individual Israeli nationals, are accused of making Security-Related deals with various regimes which--to the civilized Western world, at least--appear to be of questionable repute . What are the criteria that guide Israel's actions as a state and when issuing permits to private companies to make deals with such countries? I will not go into the details of the various criteria determined by the defense Ministry, which are often related to our own defense issues . One criterion, however, is clear: we do not allow cooperation with elements which are not State-Affiliated, such as cartels, groups, or gangs . all these are off limits . There is no question about that, and no grey areas . Therefore, if the reports from Colombia are true, the people acted counter to our policy and in violation of the law . What about working with opposition movements to certain regimes? I repeat: state movements only, or, let us say, state regimes . This is our policy . any other action runs counter to our policy . When Israeli involvement in drug trafficking in Colombia is mentioned, do you know the number of Israelis referred to? Perhaps the statement is exaggerated, and there are no more than one or two, perhaps three Israelis? that is a good point; reports are so often blown out of proportion . We seem to have some kind of reputation which often leads to exaggerated and fantastic--I do not wish to use the term romantic--reports in this context . In any event, there are many reports, and we would like to get to the core of truth behind them . After that, we will decide what action we can take . We may take legal steps, take away people's Passports, and resort to other methods . in the past, Mr Netanyahu, you belonged to an Army unit in which our finest young people served . have you found former Army friends in any of the mentioned names? no, and I hope never to find any . do you understand the phenomenon? If it exists! yes, if it exists . Our entire conversation is subject to this proviso, because we have no solid grounds for discussion . If it exists, I think it reflects the moral corruption of a few individuals . The state cannot be responsible for what each of its nationals does outside the country . These people may have succumbed to Mercenary or other temptations . The expression of selling one's soul to the devil is appropriate in their case .

This is a warning to the government of President Virgilio Barco who has announced that individuals linked to drug trafficking can be Extradited . The clandestine group, which early this morning set fire to the Llano Grande country club in Rionegro municipality , 40 km north of Medellin, sent a letter today to Omar Garces, first Superior Court judge of CALI, informing him of the threat to kill 10 judges for every person Extradited . Garces, who is also president of the Association of judicial officials in Valle del Cauca Department, said that the Extraditables sent several messages with the threat to various judicial offices in that area of the country, located 500 km from Bogota . as a result of the Extraditables' threat, the judges are holding a meeting to weigh the situation and determine the veracity of the warning . However, they decided they will not stop working .``the time has come to unite around the country's flag to recover Colombia's dignity and to prevent its bad sons from continuing to shame it before the world ,""Judge Garces said .

The Corsets had been Impregnated with pepper to disguise the cocaine's characteristic smell."
377,DEV-MUC3-0378,SAN SALVADOR,,"When much terrorist violence is created and when much Street violence is created, everyone is adversely affected; we believe the armed forces have an obligation to prevent this from happening . We believe that when it prevents violence, it is doing a more professional job than if it allowed it to take place, because once the violence gets started, the consequences of their actions may be a lot more unfortunate . We believe that the policy of trying to prevent violent plans before they are carried out is something that has produced good results . of course, the people suspected by the armed forces of supporting the Fmln plans are arrested and turned over to the judge once the evidence is gathered . I can tell you that this is very difficult . Unfortunately many of those who are arrested are later released . Many of them turn out to be innocent because suspicions may turn out to be false and the judge is there to prevent mistakes from being committed . However, the armed forces are acting within a legal framework . There are cases such as Mr Masariego . When he was released, it was confirmed that there was absolutely nothing wrong with him, and we have here documents proving that . However, he toured the United States to show off his burnt knee and to say that he had been tortured here in El Salvador . It had been proven that there was absolutely nothing wrong with him when he was released . The left wants to discredit the government and the armed forces abroad . However, I do no believe the left has been successful . Mr President, an analyst who met with us a short time ago gave his opinion on the possibility of a dialogue and its results . He was not very optimistic and he said that there were several points that could become obstacles to the dialogue . one of them was the economic measures . He said that the Fmln could not hold negotiations with the government as long as the government maintained the economic measures it was implementing . We have learned from the Fmln communiques, which always talk about the need to keep implementing the agrarian reform process and other series of points concerning the economic measures . I would like to ask you, within this framework, what can the government negotiate or what does the government understand by negotiation? could there be possible negotiation on the economic policy? I believe the word negotiation here in our country no longer has that generic meaning given by the dictionary . This word has been manipulated by leftist forces in the sense that to negotiate is to accept what the Fmln wants . According to the left, that is what negotiating means . I believe the word negotiation has a generic meaning . A negotiation is to try to find joint agreements to solve a problem and that is what we have been proposing . We have sought agreements on the largest number of points possible . logically, not all points will be accepted by the other side and we believe the Fmln is making a mistake when it thinks it will negotiate its economic, political, or social platform with the government . The Fmln must understand that they have to negotiate their plans for the country with the people . that is done by political campaigns and by showing their proposals to the public . If the people are convinced that their proposals are best, they will get the votes and they will have the right to implement their programs and their political, economic, and social programs . In this case, unfortunately they did not participate; it was our party platform that was chosen by the people . This gives the government the right to implement what the majority of the people ask of them . We do not think the Fmln should oppose this offering . The Fmln refuses to talk with the government and keeps looking for excuses and setting conditions, such as demanding that the government declare itself temporary before any talks are considered . They know they are asking the impossible . their true purpose is to refuse to talk seriously, which the Salvadoran people wants them to do . Lorena, I do not think we should confuse the various factors involved . holding a dialogue is not easy, as pointed out by this analyst, whose name I do not know . The situation is not easy to resolve . This process could well last many months or even years . It is Necessry to start now with a dialogue in which both sides begin to discuss, not what they cannot agree on, but what we can agree on . We should begin by trying to eliminate the violence that prevails in the country . If they find they cannot agree on some of the government proposals, the government should also consider an alternative stance . The Fmln keeps saying that there are no proper conditions for talking."

The raids were conducted by 13th Brigade troops in Chia, Pacho, and Bogota . This farm, known as El Castillo de Marroquin, owned by Zapata and estimated to be worth more than 100 billion pesos, was raided on Wednesday afternoon . According to the Army, this veritable fortress, located on the El Comun bridge, was managed by retired police major Alvaro Tovar Tovar . luxurious cars, a Gold-Ornamented chapel, a swimming pool fitted with a heating system , 15 stables with fine horses, a tennis court, and the impressive castle all make up a farm worth millions . extensive Gardens, long trails, and an attractive Lake complement the wonderful natural landscape of the real estate right by the Bogota northern freeway .

Carlos Andres Perez is concerned that some nations may be getting used to Livng in a climate of collective intimidation . daily events occur in Colombia amid a climate of national uncertainty . bands of drug traffickers have built an empire of dirty money and Bloodthirsty Mafias in deathly complicity with the military deployment of 140 paramilitary groups . years ago, when these groups announced their guns were aimed at progressive and leftist personalities, they operated with the unspoken complicity of many sectors, including the government . However, for some time now, the murder victims have been leftists, liberals, conservatives, and even politically independent persons who oppose the chaos created by drug traffickers, landowners, some officers, and paramilitary groups .

Pinochet's open intervention in the development of the electoral process remained clear in his 23 August speech and was recently denounced by opposition leader Patricio Aylwin and by all opposition political forces . The declaration issued by the National intelligence center, CNI--an organization that for many years has shamefully violated the most basic rights of the Chilean people by using the most cruel and inhuman forms of terror and violence against Chilean Democrats and whose dissolution has been proposed even by the government's candidate Hernan Buchi--intends to Misguide the people by once again trying to implicate the Pcch in an incident in which it had no participation whatsoever . The CNI declaration, expressly ordered by authorities of the regime, goes to the extreme of Infamously manipulating family ties to attack our General Secretary, comrade Volodia Teitelboim . The regime seeks to create a climate of terror and intimidation in order to impose the Antidemocratic demands recently made by Pinochet . to this end, and as Pinochet himself has stated, the regime is willing even to resort to force once again . part of this plan is the murder of Luis Vargas, who was arrested and tortured by the CNI and later thrown out of a Fifth- floor window of the military court building after being falsely charged with having an arsenal in his home; the Scandalous Court decision that leaves unpunished those responsible for the inhuman death of Rodrigo Rojas Denegri and the serious injury of Carmen Gloria Quintana; the shameful Supreme Court decision clearing those responsible for the horrible crimes against 10 Chileans in late 1976; the regime's intention to impose a new amnesty law to leave thousands of cases of violation of human rights in the past 16 years unpunished; the arrest and Incommunicado detention of 13 people, among them a pregnant woman allegedly involved in the incidents at the Tobalaba airport and for whose physical and psychological integrity we fear . This is the consequence of Pinochet, the CNI, and the circles close to the dictatorship's despair in view of the progress made by the Democratic struggle and the growing unity of all Oposition forces around a single presidential candidate and a common platform designed to democratize the country . As always when it feels threatened, the dictatorship has decided to divide and confuse the opposition forces . We appeal to all Democrats to come together even more firmly so the level of unity achieved by the opposition sector will not allow such maneuvers to jeopardize the resolute progress toward the much desired democracy and freedom for our people . We also urge that this provocation be denounced by doubling efforts to overwhelmingly defeat the dictatorship on 14 December, thus taking a decisive step in the struggle to definitively oust this regime of hatred, death, and pain . signed: Americo Zorrilla, Jaime Insunza, and Carlos Molinas for the Communist party of Chile."

We do not see it as separate from the social mobilization carried out by people burdened by hundreds of daily problems, a mobilization to recover their rights to food, jobs, health, housing, and education--to a way of life worthy of human beings . five or six million hungry and poor Chileans is a scandal, and they deserve a share of the wealth of those who took over the country's government . We need to demand and defend the respect for life that has not been guaranteed during these past 16 years in our Fatherland . a single day does not go by without a defender of freedom becoming a victim of the regime's repressive apparatus . The Communist representative added: We want peace for Chile . We want the deadly violence and terrorism unleashed on 11 September 1973 to end once and for all . The Chilean dilemma continues to be democracy or dictatorship, liberty or tyranny, perpetuation in power or a new life . Volodia Teitelboim has indeed made a call to get organized, to unite, and to convince . The perpetuation of power is now called Hernan Buchi . We must all unite to defeat Pinochet . Buchi is his man . Teitelboim pointed out that the people did not make a mistake . They just had to change a letter of Buchi's propagandistic slogans to restore the truth: Buchi is not the man; rather, he represents hunger . in its 15th Congress the Pcch made a call to defeat the minister who has made millions of people poor, the minister who has now become a Demagogue and is promising the moon and an unrealistic world for the people; that is, the minister who is promising everything he failed to accomplish in his years as Minister . Buchi's insincere promises are surpassed only by another talkative presidential candidate of the regime: Mr Errazuriz . Volodia Teitelboim then added: in order to guarantee the victory of democracy, it is necessary to organize the United forces of all those who hope for liberty . We hereby call for the creation of millions of Commandos for democracy and broad committees across the country to display initiatives, encourage imagination, and form caravans of people who will give explanations from door to door and from person to person, implementing a fervent and overwhelming dynamic capable of changing Chile on 14 December 1989 . our people have always played an outstanding role in the crucial crossroads of the 20th century . They are playing it now, fighting wholeheartedly, convinced that the victory of democracy will represent a significant step toward respecting human rights, an emphatic and righteous no to impunity, and a substantive yes to liberty for all political prisoners and to the dissolution of the CNI . The outstanding Communist leader and intellectual said that these are days for generosity and spiritual grandeur . seeking democracy, we are shaking hands with all those with whom we have had disagreements in the past . We want to emphasize this . Although we are motivated by different political concepts, this is a creative time for a common denominator, joint actions, and for everyone to lend a hand . If the opposition marches United toward 14 December, it will achieve a overwhelming victory that will be registered in Chilean history as a golden date of extraordinary significance . such a victory will finally restore a right that has repeatedly been requested and violated: the right to rejoice and to trust in the future with the certainty that no one will slip unnoticed through the shadows of the night to kill a Chilean with impunity . The people, added Volodia Teitelboim, are beginning to paint the walls with a slogan: the people win, the dictatorship is over . The dictatorship will end and the people will win . If we win in 14 December and Doubtlessly we will, and if we--always acting in unison--immediately spoil Pinochet's plans, we will then the President of the President or the perpetual boss . the top leader of Chilean Communists warned that the dangers and difficulties demand that we remain alert and work even harder . We must bury all attempts by the general and his Faithfuls to stop or reverse Chile's progress toward new horizons . Volodia Teitelboim pointed out that Patricio Aylwin, during a meeting at the opening ceremony for the Christian left party offices, expressed his desire to be able to implement a truly democratic government that will make all Chileans active again in democratic life . This purpose reflects the sentiments of a vast majority of the people who want to turn the bloody page of the dictatorship and put an end to political and social neglect and to the divisions between humans, between Pariahs and privileged ones, and between first-class, second-class, or Third-Class people, where some enjoy every right while others are denied even the right to live . in his speech over a partial radio network, the Pcch Secretary General said: We dream about and strive for a Chile without missing people, without executed people, without burned youths, without political prisoners, without exiles--a Fatherland of equals among equals."

Speaking at a news conference, Col montano said that the maimed Fmln fighters' presence at the metropolitan cathedral is an indication that Fmln leaders abandon their fighters when they cease to be useful . I believe that if the Fmln wanted to send those people abroad, as they have done in the past, they could very well have done so . They have the fighters at the cathedral for propaganda purposes, and to give the impression that the government is inhumane .

429,DEV-MUC3-0430,CARACAS ,1989-09-05,"The extensive border shared by Venezuela and Colombia is today, more than ever, the cause of concern for the Caracas government . The offensive against drug trafficking ordered by President Barco is viewed by local commentators as a dangerous threat to Venezuela due to its proximity to Colombia, with whom Venezuela shares over 2,000 km . The border with Colombia has always been a cause of concern for Venezuelan governments . on several Ocassions Venezuela had to face raids into its territory, as well as the kidnapping of Stockbreeders, smuggling of goods, and drug trafficking by Colombian guerrillas and criminals . The war declared by the Colombian government on the Medellin cartel opens up the possibility that many of the drug Chieftains, and perhaps some drug kingpins, may seek refuge in Venezuelan territory . Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez warned that if drug traffickers attempt to transfer their industries to Venezuela they will have to``face Venezuelan justice, and certainly Extradition trials .""the States of Zulia, Tachira, and Apure--in Western Venezuela--border Colombian territory and have been the scene of drug trafficking operations many times . in the past few days Venezuelan security forces have increased vigilance at the main border posts because of rumors that drug traffickers have begun moving to Venezuela . Governor of Zulia state Ismael Ordaz confirmed to newsmen that the government has intensified control and vigilance measures at the border with Colombia . He noted there is broad cooperation between the Venezuelan and Colombian authorities in the struggle against drug trafficking . during a radio program on Monday , 4 September, journalist Jose Vicente Rangel, former movement toward socialism presidential candidate, maintained that it is not at this time that drug traffickers are attempting to enter Venezuela because they entered a long time ago . Rangel maintained that Venezuela annually serves as a bridge for drug trafficking worth some $20 billion . Furthermore, he said, the expensive Venezuelan electoral campaigns have also received resources obtained from drug trafficking . The figures given by Rangel are equivalent to 66 percent of the Venezuelan foreign debt, which amounts to some $30 million that the government is currently trying to renegotiate . Moreover, Rangel said, during the electoral campaign that concluded with the election of Carlos Andres Perez in December 1988, political parties invested some 5 billion bolivares in propaganda . This figure is excessive if one takes into account that, as established by the law, the state only contributes 100 million bolivares for the electoral campaigns held every 5 years . Rangel added that the possible transfer of Colombian drug trafficking operation centers to Venezuela is very worrying if one takes into account that Venezuelan government officials have openly admitted the lack of vigilance at the borders . However, while Colombia is attempting, perhaps belatedly, not to yield to the economic power and violence of drugs, there seems to be no awareness in Venezuela about the grave danger posed by the alleged change of address which, according to some reports, is being planned by Colombian drug traffickers."
430,DEV-MUC3-0431,LIMA,,"It is clear that Neo-Liberalism is the ideology of the North . If in the past liberalism was a factor that promoted progress and independence in Latin America, neo- liberalism is now the state ideology of the more powerful nations . It is an authoritarian ideology that does not question all types of States, but only the States of the South . Under the guise of eliminating bureaucracy and promoting efficiency, Neo-Liberalism wants to destroy the state to eliminate any resistance to the hegemony of the world market . We should not play that game . ideological Nonalignment should therefore redefine the state and defend its strength in our countries . When I say state I am not referring merely to the individual States that every one of us represents . I am referring to an accord that our States should reach in each region . We must recognize that we are United in Continental blocs . We must promote our regional economy . only through regional initiatives will we have power in the current process of restructuring the market . It is therefore imperative to call--in each continent--more frequent and regular meetings of our movement . We must organize the Nonaligned movement on a Continental basis to strengthen it in all places . Many have come to this meeting to propose an administrative structure for our movement to insure its continuity . This can be viewed as a suggestion . It is a lot more important, though, to recognize the existence of regional differences and to create intermediate Nonaligned movement organizations wherever possible . These intermediate organizations should strengthen the principles of the movement in each region, thus expanding its power . Although it's taken sometime, I believe that we have already adopted this approach in Latin America through the creation of the political consultation mechanism of the group of eight, which gives common answers to the economic crisis and to political intervention . Mr President, in honoring our Founders--Tito, Nehru, and Nasser--I should stress the ethical significance of Nonalignment . without the power of nuclear bombs or money, we have upheld the moral values of mankind to help it to continue to struggle in all fields . Therefore, our movement cannot remain indifferent to the very serious problem of drug trafficking and drug addiction, which has spread around the world . It is true that this is essentially a problem that affects rich countries, because drug addiction reflects the most refined stage of consumption, the consumption of Insatisfaction . Yet it is also true that we, as drug producers or dealers, are involuntary partners . like neo- liberalism, drug trafficking has perversely tried to take over . drug trafficking is also a form of hegemony by the large rich markets, which are thereby distorting and corrupting our society . drug trafficking also seeks to destroy States, as it is now doing in Colombia . I believe we should raise the banner of mankind's moral values; we should tell the rich that even if they ignore our claims for justice, we will not ignore their youth and their children, who must be defended from drug addiction . The U.S. President will formulate a proposal on the subject tomorrow, and we hope it will be an All-Encompassing proposal . The problem is not just over helicopters an ammunition . It involves an accord between the United States and Europe, on one side, and the countries that are directly involved on the other . The production of drugs, in particular, calls for structural treatment, without which any military aid will be insufficient . Our movement must adopt a strong stand against drug trafficking and undertake joint measures to eradicate it .

It looks like candy, but this is turning our cities into battlefields and is killing our children . This is how President Bush began his speech, in which he delivered his plan to U.S. citizens on fighting drug traffickers . The huge number of drug users made the government increase the $2 billion budget last year . As you can see on this chart, in 1985 the government estimated that 23 million U.S. citizens were using drugs on a casual basis; that is, at least once during the past month . Last year, this figure dropped by over 1/3, which means that 9 million U.S. citizens have ceased being occasional drug users . Although the overall cocaine usage has dropped, the frequent use of cocaine has almost doubled in the past few years . These are the casual cocaine users, those who consume crack, and who represent the most serious and urgent problem .

The defense claims that there is a sworn statement by former Minister Carlos Obando Velasco that certifies that he was with Jubis Hazvumb on the day Galan was killed . The lawyers also claim that Galan Sarmiento was killed by an Uzi Submachinegun and that the one found at the apartment where the six suspects were arrested was an Ingram . ballistic test results have not yet been revealed . The defense lawyers have appealed the court decision, and now the court will have to decide if the decision issued by the third public judge is to stand."

We are going to study their proposals . We believe that although the proposals come from an opposition party, we should analyze them .

We should instead adopt the attitude of rejecting crime .""regarding the proposals he will make during his upcoming visit to the UN Heardquarters and the recent attacks in Guatemala, which he said are aimed at destroying the accomplishments achieved during the democratic process, Cerezo Arevalo added:``among the issues we are going to point out is that, at this moment, Guatemala is the target of an Attemp to undermine the consolidation of democracy . We are going to need the help of democracies that are friends of Guatemala, but not in the capacity of judges . We are going to need total support to control a domestic and international terrorist offensive that is taking place in the country and that seeks to destroy the Republic .""there are people interested in having the large number of refugees who have returned to the country since Cerezo was sworn in leave the country again to discredit Guatemala, president Cerezo said .``during 3 and 1/2 years of democracy, in which we implemented plans and guaranteed the rights of all citizens, Guatemala began to welcome all kinds of people: refugees--Guatemalans who have been living in exile for years in Mexico and other countries; people who had been threatened and who were living in Costa Rica and who have returned . We do not even know where these people work because, for us, they are Guatemalans who have returned . However, we are beginning to receive reports from them . They have told us they are being systematically threatened over the telephone . who knows where these people are or how they got their telephone numbers?

488,DEV-MUC3-0489,MOSCOW ,,"During the last 3 weeks in Colombia, you know, a real war has been going on, a war being waged by the government on the drugs mafia . In Bogota, Medellin, CALI, and other towns shots are heard, bombs explode, blood is flowing, and more and more often we hear the words the Medellin cartel . This is the heart of the Colombian mafia . What is it? How did it form? with this question I turn to you, Yuriy Nikolayevich . Incidentally, I know you have been in Medellin . Yes, while working in Latin America as a correspondent for USSR state television and radio I was able to visit Medellin once . There was a seminar there on the problems of Central America . outwardly it is a very attractive town, very green, situated on a plain, and it is called Eternally Blossoming . After several hours in Medellin bursts of Submachinegun fire rang out suddenly in the streets and I understood then that I was in the center of the cocaine mafia . Two Clans of bandits were exchanging fire and passers-by literally had to run away from the scene of events as fast as they could . local colleagues showed me a huge district consisting of luxurious Villas where the Godfathers of the Colombia drug mafia live . It is difficult to even approach these houses: they are surrounded by barbed wire and there are Video cameras and watch towers . If you decide to go fairly close the guards will open fire Withour warning . I was also able to see a nineteenth-century castle, a rare and extremely beautiful building, a genuine architectural monument . This castle belongs to one of the heads of the mafia, Carlos Lehder . Yes, Yuriy Nikolaevich, but how was the Medellin cartel formed? some information on its history, if you could . by rights the founder of the cartel is considered to be Carlos Enrique Lehder, who was able to unite the cocaine mafia of Colombia around him at the beginning of the seventies . a few words about Lehder himself: he is a desperate Extremist who holds nothing sacred . He has hundreds of human lives on his conscience . It is not for nothing that his friends gave him at various times the Nick names rum Robin Hood, the drugs Baron, and so on . Carlos Lehder is distinguished for his audacity and a restless disposition . together with him other Colombian families have been occupied in this advantageous business, namely the Ochoa and Escobar families . at the end of the eighties a cocaine war began between these three Clans . later, however, they came to an agreement and the Medellin cartel was formed in the press many reports have appeared stating that literally billions of dollars pass through the hands of the cartel . is this true? the cartel's annual income, as the press claims, is $8 billion . to sketch the scale of cocaine operations I will remind you that in 1984, for example, the cartel Bigwigs proposed to the government to clear Colombia's entire foreign debt within a week--and I will remind you that this is $9 billion--if the government would release mafia members who had been arrested . not very long ago a West German magazine published a list of the richest people in the world and one of the heads of the Medellin cartel--Jorge Ochoa--is by no means last on that list . I would like to mention another case that characterizes the dimensions of the drug mafia's means . four years ago it came to light that the cartel had taken part in negotiations on buying a whole consignment of Surface-To-Air missiles, several military helicopters, and other modern weapons . How is this lethal arsenal used? it is completely natural that the cartel could not exist without a complete army of Mercenary killers and informants who have penetrated into literally all spheres of the Colombian economy, Parliament, and the Army . The main target of the Mafiosi are progressive politicians, who in one way or another threaten the drugs business . I will remind you that the same Carlos Lehder in 1984 organized the assassination of Lara Bonilla, the Colombian Minister of justice . in 1986 Guillermo Cano, the director of the progressive newspaper El Espectador was murdered, and it was basically after this Muder that the Hunt for Lehder began . in the same year he was arrested and handed over to U.S. justice, which sentenced him to life imprisonment . It should also be noted that there exists an agreement between the U.S. and Colombian governments on the Extradition of especially dangerous criminals . If we take the present war--it cannot be called anything else--what were its immediate causes?"

Unfortunately, a new terrorist action has taken place in the capital city of the Republic . The first explosion occurred on 59th street, between 13th and 7th avenues . The second explosion took place at a bank branch on 60th Street and 7th Avenue . The first explosion, as you can now see, went off at the Conavi branch, close to the offices of the social savings Fund . This bank was completely destroyed .

No injuries or damage were reported . The rocket partially perforated one of the walls of the embassy, but did not explode . The already tight security surrounding the embassy since the war against drug traffic was declared was stepped up immediately and traffic and pedestrians were kept out of the area . This attacked followed the two dynamite explosions that occurred early Sunday evening in the northern area of Bogota where one person was slightly injured and approximately 30 locals were damaged . During the Belisario Betacur administration, when several Colombian drug traffickers were Extradited to the United States, the U.S. Embassy was attacked in a similar manner . No injuries were reported during that attack . later, however, a bomb exploded in the embassy's parking lot killing a Colombian woman who was standing in line to get a visa . like in other attacks of this kind reported over the past few weeks in Bogota and in other cities, no organization has claimed responsibility for this attack; however, the press and the authorities are blaming persons in the service of the drug Lords."
491,DEV-MUC3-0492,DHAKA ,1989-09-09,"President George Bush has declared his country's war against drug traffickers in a dramatic manner, committing a massive fund of $7.86 billion for the programme, providing increased powers to law-enforcement agencies and even offering substantial financial assistance to other countries, especially in Latin America, fighting this menace . to deal with what he called,``America's toughest domestic test in decades""during his stern address on Tuesday, the us leader has given a new boost to the continuing International crusade against narcotics . This new initiative will be warmly welcomed by the world community, most of all by Latin American countries, especially Colombia which is fighting a desperate battle against cocaine barons . The news from Bogota is simply frightening . in the country's long war against drug dealers, nothing like what is happening now--the merciless killing of security officers and their relatives--has ever happened before . should Colombia lose this war against cocaine barons, drug Lords in other Latin American countries will flex their muscles too . to put it plainly, Colombia cannot afford to lose this war . But whether she wins or losses this battle depends on what assistance the United States can provide to this Latin American country . Here, Colombia faces difficult options . While she has accepted some logistic support, such as helicopters, from Washington, she maintains here opposition to the use of us troops in tackling what she rightly regards as a domestic crisis . The statement by Mr Bush on Wednesday has so far made no difference to this opposition . The problem facing Bogota is, while an increase in the logistic support from us would help, the government cannot overnight raise the strength of its Ani-Narcotic security forces . with the financial assistance offered by the United States, Bogota can, of course, buy arms for use against drug barons . But the battle will still be hard and long . In fighting this relentless battle against cocaine dealers, Colombia has made one perfectly valid point, more than once . true, it is the responsibility of the government of Colombia to win its internal war, with all the help that Washington can provide . But the real battle against drug dealers must be fought within the United States, on the streets of New York, Washington, Chicago and all other cities . This is the market for the cocaine barons of Colombia or for the drugs produced in the infamous Golden Triangle in Asia . and it is also within the United States where all the channels of distribution, some controlled by us citizens, thrive under the eyes of the us law enforcement agencies . The international community may ask if enough has been done to deal with this problem at the us end . This statement by Mr Bush suggests that his administration has recognised this basic problem and wants to do something about it . a major portion of the funding support for the anti-drug war will be used in strengthening the law-enforcement agencies within the United States . But questions have been raised by members of the us Congress whether the President has gone far enough in that direction . In fact, there is some disappointment that the President's plan has not been``bold enough""either . While one must admit that the us Congressmen are used to making such criticisms against the administration on problem on which they themselves rarely offer any new initiative, one hopes that the us administration will keep its Newly-Unveiled anti-drug plan under constant scrutiny and ensure that the battle that Colombia is being urged to win at all costs is not lost within the United States."

Whatever course history may take in the future, we know that hundreds upon hundreds have prepared themselves, and we know that in their wisdom the Chilean people will not allow such a sad history to be repeated, be whenever it may . We have not sown in the desert or plowed at sea . These past 16 years represent an experience whose value is virtually impossible to assess . It is clear that important steps forward have been taken . It is clear that the Plebiscite was unquestionably a step forward . I remember the day we unveiled Allende's bust at the hospital . I expressed the certainty that the Chilean people would vote against Pinochet, despite Pinochet's resources and the psychological warfare and terrorist methods that were used to intimidate the masses . It would be impossible for a people to forget the many crimes and Monstrosities that have been committed . It is impossible . in effect, the Plebiscite was a harsh blow for Pinochet . I think also that the elections will be an extremely harsh blow, perhaps an irreversible blow, to Pinochet . However, it is a fact that nobody can assert here that Pinochet's defeat in the election will be the solution to the problem of the dictatorship in Chile . I am not talking about a revolution . I think it would be unnecessary . There would be no sense in talking here about a revolution a stage above the Democratic opening . We are talking about a Democratic opening, but the electoral victory does not entail a solid Democratic opening yet . However, in our opinion it will undoubtedly represent another very important step forward . Pinochet will try to stay on as head of the Army and as head of the armed forces . We could almost say that he will stay on as a sort of sentinel, a power on which the country's destiny would continue to hang for some time to come . whether he can really fulfill the goals he has set for himself remains to be seen . However, I am certain he will not give up power without a struggle . only the Chilean people can make this an irreversible struggle to achieve a true and full Democratic opening, an opening without all of the limitations that the regime has written into its Constitution, which grants him all of these rights--to be a Senator for life, and, if my memory does not fail me, to serve as chief of the Army for an additional 8 years . look at his Harangues . His Harangues are still aggressive, haughty, and threatening . We hear warnings . We hear appeals to the Army to remain United, because he will undoubtedly try to perpetuate himself . I think he will be more and more cornered by the Chilean people, because a new stage will begin after the elections . It is inevitable that the people will participate to a much greater extent . They will inevitably have a much greater possibility of expressing themselves, of acting, of mobilizing, of thinking about what is essential at the moment and not about shares of power . I think they have to be...that this is really an admirable test of patriotic and revolutionary feeling for those who are not Rightists, for those who are not conservatives, for those who are not even in the center but on the left, and well to the left: to go to the polls and to vote, forgetting which party it was that put forward the candidate for President, or what the candidate's political thinking is, just thinking of Chile, only thinking of Chile."

496,DEV-MUC3-0497,HAVANA ,1989-09-16,"For the first time in virtually 10 years of armed conflict, which has claimed almost 70,000 lives, the Salvadoran government and guerrillas signed an agreement recently in Mexico city . This could mark the beginning of an unprecedented path of peace for that central American country . After 2 days of talks, Farabundo Marti National liberation front representatives and Salvadoran government delegates agreed to establish a permanent dialogue to secure a definite cease-fire . On 16 and 17 October, the Costa Rican capital will host the meeting between the negotiating parties . The event will be attended by two representatives of the Catholic Church as Mediators for the Salvadoran Episcopal conference . UN and OAS representatives will be invited to attend as witnesses . Aside from matters of procedure, it is worthwhile to say that, in addition to being decisive in achieving a solution to the Salvadoran internal crisis, the rebels' recent peace initiative was a strong blow to the ruling Ultra-Rightist sector . The rebels' willingness to end hostilities and turn the Fmln into a political party placed before President Alfredo Cristiani the decision of continuing the war or opting for peace . As of that moment, and in view of the importance assigned to the talks by the International media and analysts, international public opinion kept abreast of the dialogue, which is so vital for El Salvador and for Central America . for the Nationalist Republican alliance, the proposals were clearly defined to agree on a total cease-fire before 31 January, to end the repression, to conduct a purge in the Army, and to reorganize the judicial and electoral system . Although details were not given on how the issues will be handled, the fact remains that discussions between the two parties will begin in only a month . It means that the veiled government intention to delay the talks and continue the war, which it cannot win in any event, has failed . We might even add that the arena government has been on the defensive from the beginning, especially following the Tela summit which appealed to the Salvadoran authorities to hold dialogue as soon as possible with the rebels . President Cristiani's attempt to secure the forceful demobilization of the guerrillas and his attempt to compare these forces with the Nicaraguan Counterrevolutionaries also failed . The seriousness of the Salvadoran government's position and its willingness to secure a definitive peace agreement will be in evidence at the next meetings . Meanwhile, the prospects for achieving peace in the country appear to be favorable."
497,DEV-MUC3-0498,MOSCOW ,1989-09-20,"The central American mass media has regarded the intention of Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani to continue negotiations with the Farabundo Marti National liberation front within the framework of the existing Constitution as a deviation from recent agreements with the rebels . The intention is outlined in a statement made by the President in Repsonse to the Rebel proposal to give up the armed struggle and join the political life if the Army cleans up its ranks, if repressions are stopped, elections to municipal and legislative bodies are held earlier than 1991 and if the election system is reformed . According to the Salvadoran mass media, this package of proposals will be dominate the Fmln talks with the Salvadoran government in Costa Rica in October . at the same time, the Salvadoran police have staged another act of violence in San Salvador . special police units dispersed a demonstration organised by the Federation of Salvadoran trade unions in protest against the arrest of 12 activists of workers' and peasant organisations . about 100 demonstrators sheltered in a cathedral . But, the police smashed the cathedral's windows and shot tear gas into the building . policemen also opened fire and Army helicopters circled over the cathedral . Despite the fact that many people inside were wounded, the police did not allow Red Cross representatives to approach the cathedral, as demonstrators demanded . about 60 demonstrators were first brutally beaten and then arrested, the San Salvadoran mass media said."
498,DEV-MUC3-0499,MOSCOW ,1989-09-10,"A U.S. Department of state spokesman has indicated that Washington proposes to continue helping the Salvadoran regime until the Farabundo Marti National liberation front combatants surrender their arms . The timing of this statement is remarkable . Let us recall that less than 1 week ago representatives of the Rebel forces and the Salvadoran government met in Mexico, thus launching a dialogue aimed at a national reconciliation . The parties agreed to continue these talks in Costa Rica on 16 and 17 October, however, even the first round of talks in Mexico showed that continuing the war was pointless because neither of the parties is capable of military defeating the other . Thus, the only possible victory for all is the victory of common sense . This can be achieved only through national dialogue . The rebels have correctly made it clear that no preconditions can be set for continuing dialogue, and less still can it be demanded that the Fmln combatants should unilaterally surrender their arms . It should be noted this demand is being made while the Salvadoran government is getting considerable military aid from the United States and, according to the Department of state spokesman, it has no plans to discontinue this aid . The Salvadoran military is using U.S.-made weapons only against the rebels and not against any foreign enemy . It is well known that throughout the 10 years of civil war in El Salvador, the United States has supplied almost $4 billion worth of military and Nonmilitary aid to that country . Thanks to this assistance , 70,000 Salvadorans have been killed and over 1 million people have had to leave the country to save their lives . We can see that additional U.S. military aid will inflict further untold suffering and misfortunes on the Salvadoran people . putting an end to this assistance and to any further interference in Salvadoran domestic affairs would help dispel mutual distrust and would create in the country an atmosphere favorable to national dialogue . Washington's demands that the rebels should surrender their arms as a precondition for Washington to reconsider the issue of military aid to the Salvadoran regime represents, as far as I am concerned, unacceptable interference in El Salvador's domestic affairs . Undoubtedly, the process of national reconciliation must take place free of any foreign interference whatsoever . I would like to quote Joaquin Villalobos, a rebel leader, who told the New York times that the end of U.S. military aid to the Salvadoran regime would lead to an immediate end to the war."

501,DEV-MUC3-0502,MEXICO CITY ,1989-09-22,"According to Western diplomats, Colombian drug traffickers have moved to Guatemala in search of new supply routes, bringing instability to a country that is experiencing a wave of violence from various sectors . The diplomats believe that up to 200 COLOMBIANS linked to the Medellin and CALI cartels are now operating in Guatemala and that about 500 kg of cocaine pass every week through the country, essentially Enroute to the U.S. market . The increasing drug trafficking activity coincides with a new wave of kidnappings, bombings, and murders in Guatemala, awakening fears that the country will return to the violence prevalent at the beginning of the decade, when thousands were killed by death squads during military regimes . Since August, a prominent politician, a well-known banker, and at least five university students have been murdered . Several bombs have exploded in the capital in recent months and students and human rights activists are missing .``all of this violence cannot be blamed on a, but the increase of drug trafficking is clearly an additional concern .""in addition to the cocaine, which the diplomats say is taken to the United States aboard light planes or in automobiles through Mexico and Texas, U.S. officials have reported an increase in opium production in Guatemala . According to estimates, the number of hectares planted went from 225 in 1985 to 1,500 this year . There are insistent rumors that banker Ramiro Castillo love was murdered outside his house on 25 August because he refused to launder drug money . There is open talk in the capital about important politicians being linked to drug trafficking . Nevertheless, the diplomats say that there is no evidence to back such speculation and they add that it is very likely that several interests are working to destabilize the country's fragile democracy .``It seems as if several strings are being pulled at the same time ,""a diplomat said . While Christian Democratic President Vinicio Cerezo has given Guatemala a respite, after decades of military regimes during which it is believed that more than 100,000 people were killed as a result of political violence, it is estimated that approximately 1,200 leftist guerrillas are still fighting in the mountains . Furthermore, the country has faced two coup attempts since democracy was restored in 1986 . The Ultra-Right-Wing, with its ties to the Land-Owning Oligarchy, continues to be a powerful force in the country . It has blocked a majority of reforms that Cerezo has tried to introduce and, according to the general consensus, it has promoted discontent among the armed forces' Mid-Level officers .``the Ultra-Right-Wing is undoubtedly behind part of the violence ,""said a diplomat .``it could be trying to force the government to overreact or cause the Army to get involved .""as if to confirm this, a police arrest warrant has been issued against former presidential candidate Lionel Sisniega, a noted politician who leans to the right and has been involved in coup attempts since 1954, on charges of heading a group responsible for much of the violence in the country . diplomats have also pointed to the resurgence of activities by Left-Wing guerrillas who have been struggling to topple successive governments over the past 2 decades .``nowadays they are using much more obvious tactics, erecting barricades on highways and occupying small towns near the capital ,""one diplomat said . fear that the violence of the seventies will return may also contribute toward a resurgence in the number of illegal immigrants that cross over to Mexico . Mexican authorities say that the number of Undocumented central Americans Deported to Guatemala has doubled over the past few months . The diplomats feel that Cerezo's government will weather the violence and pass it onto his successor after the Presidential elections scheduled for November 1990 .``perhaps the situation is the result of the preparation for elections in Guatemala ,""a diplomat said .``things will probably worsen next year .

Here are excerpts of General Larios' statements when he announced that the armed forces would consider a reduction in troops ....when it involves damaging the institution--in this case the armed forces--we must understand that we were not born on a whim, or by happenstance or accident . We are a constitutional institution and the Constitution has established clear tasks for us . Thus, our institution is authentic and legal . because of this, the concept or criteria of a reduction in armed forces personnel can be managed if it is based on very particular and specific terms . If, for example, we reach a political agreement with the terrorist forces for their peaceful return to the country's Democratic life, then this would mean the end of the armed conflict . It would also mean that we, as the country's armed forces, would have to study and reconsider the need for the number of troops that we presently have available to confront an imposed situation, an aggression of a Marxist-Leninist nature . If an agreement in this sense is reached, we would be willing to analyze the institution's internal situation to determine the amount of human resources needed to comply with our constitutional responsibility . Those were statements by the defense Minister at noon . He announced that the armed forces would be willing to study a reduction in forces if an agreement is reached between the government and rebel commissions at the meeting to be held in San Jose, Costa Rica, on 16 and 17 October . General Larios said that peace will be attained before the established date if the rebels show their good will to end the armed conflict in our country . This was last minute news .

There were two positions at the Senate: those who advocated that the aid be divided in three packages to continue the delivery of the last portion of the aid to the government amid the dialogue process, and those who wanted to give unconditional aid to Cristiani, a position basically defended by Christopher Dodd . Senator Dodd himself said this aid is allegedly to encourage Cristiani because he is accomplishing what the United States has been trying to accomplish in the past 10 years . However, the U.S .

They voted for the unconditional aid which actually encourages the military men and the Hardliners in arena who are blocking the political solution of the conflict and who unreasonably promote the continuation of the war .

516,DEV-MUC3-0517,SAN SALVADOR,1989-09-23,"Salvadoran vice president Francisco Merino stated today that the military aspects of the agreements that the government may reductions . According to the Vice President, an effective ceasefire agreement with the Fmln must also include the control of violent actions by mass organizations in El Salvador . Merino made reference to the doubts that certain military command sectors have about the Fmln's proposal . He said that these doubts are present, mainly because the rebels have not kept their public promises concerning military actions in the past . However, the official commented that, in the long run, a ceasefire agreement would lead to negotiations on important issues, such as military troop reductions, that must be accepted by the armed forces . Let us hear vice president Merino: we cannot ignore that the Fmln and even the previous government have made promises that they never kept . The Armed Forces are a permanent institution and they have previously suffered the noncompliance of agreements that had been made by the previous government with the Fmln . Now, the lack of trust must be overcome with specific actions in the future . Here, we have something that must be clearly appreciated . The government is responsible for the dialogue process . The Armed Forces are part of the government; they are an institution . President Cristiani is the general commander of the armed forces . Thus, the armed forces' position is also included in President Cristiani's statements . According to Merino, commentaries that have been made by several military commanders are to be understood as commentaries outside any agreement that the government may reach with the rebels . on the same subject, the Vice President also commented that it is necessary for the guerrillas to change their military behavior, as they have to show that they really want to start a progressive war De-Escalation process . The effectiveness and totality with which the Fmln stops hostilities; ceases its acts of sabotage against electricity, communications, and public transportation facilities; and stops the use of Mines will determine the level of the Salvadoran Army's offensive actions . This is logical, as when there is no aggression, there can be no action to counter it . Merino said that the government proposal includes an agreement for the Fmln to drastically decrease Street violence in El Salvador, such as the violence promoted by mass organizations recently . hostilities are not only those actions that include the use of miltary force, such as mines, bombs, and so on . They also include Fmln mass organization actions that are carried out mainly in San Salvador and are creating a certain degree of Destabilization . It is a kind of urban terrorism, as these groups are distorting the right to protest or the right of expression . These organizations are no longer only carrying a message, but have started to destroy and damage private property and public transportation, and threaten the citizens' integrity . Thus, you see here a direct relationship which demands that the Fmln military actions and ceasefire must include urban actions, as well . A ceasefire must also include that the Fmln will not carry out offensive actions or actions by facade groups in the cities that promote Street disorder . During President Cristiani's 15-Day-Absence, Merino reported that he will work on the proposal that the government will present to the Fmln in San Jose, Costa Rica on 16 October, with an advisory Commission formed by military officers, private businessmen, intellectuals, and political party leaders."

The M-19 proposal has taken by surprise the government of Virgilio Barco, inasmuch as it had voiced its determination not to hold any dialogue with the narcotics traffickers, a judicial source has told Reuter .``the issue of the dialogue is becoming very serious and I believe that the government will have to take it seriously a war always concludes with a peace agreement ,""one of the advisers of former justice Minister Monica de Greiff said . The M-19 proposal, which includes a plan so the narcotics traffickers themselves will finance a campaign against drug consumption, has not been accepted yet by the government . in an official communique, it was stressed that the issue of the dialogue with the narcotics traffickers will not form part of the peace agreement reached with the M-19 . relations between the Colombian guerrilla groups and the narcotics traffickers have had their UPS and downs throughout the years . At first, some armed groups gave protection to the narcotics traffickers in exchange for money for purchasing weapons . However, later, when they tried to take over part of the business, they were harshly fought by the paramilitary bands of the extreme right financed with drug money . Pizarro said today that the topic will not affect the signing of the agreement, which has been postponed since 24 September for``last-minute minor difficulties .""he also pointed out that the weapons of the organization, which has over 600 Militants, will not be turned over to the Army, but to an international organization, probably the Red Cross . However, while the M-19--which according to the peace plan should be Demobilized at the end of the year--is asking for a dialogue with the narcotics traffickers, the intelligence services announced that Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, also known as``El Mexicano ,""is surrounded and will be Imminently captured . A spokesman for the administrative Department of security has told Reuter:``We believe we will be capturing important people within the next few days, although we do not know if Rodriguez Gacha will also be captured .""Rodriguez Gacha and Pablo Escobar are considered the Capos of the fearful Medellin cartel, a narcotics organization which together with its twin organization in CALI is charged with exporting 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States . The Colombian government has offered a 100-Million-Pesos reward to any citizen providing information on the whereabouts of the two Most-Wanted men in Colombia . On 25 September, a judge ordered the arrested of Freddy Rodriguez Celades, son of``El Mexicano ,""for illegal Pssession of firearms . National police chief general Miguel Gomez Padilla recently announced that the two narcotics traffickers are in Colombian territory, thus denying rumors to the effect they were setting up bases in Panama or Brazil."

M-19 commander Carlos Pizarro said today that the organization, which has a little more than 600 members, will not turn in its weapons to the Army, but to an international organization, possibly the Red Cross . However, while the M-19 is calling for a dialogue with the drug traffickers, intelligence services have announced that Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, alias``El Mejicano ,""has been surrounded and will soon be captured . A spokesman for the administrative security Department, the Colombian intelligence organization, told Reuter:``We believe that important arrests will be made in the next few days, although we do not know if we will catch Rodriguez Gacha .""Rodriguez Gacha and Pablo Escobar are considered to be the heads of the fearsome Medellin cartel, an organization of drug traffickers that, along with its twin organization in CALI, is accused of supplying 80 percent of the cocaine that is consumed in the United States . The Colombian government has offered a reward of 100 million pesos to any citizen who provides information on the whereabouts of the two most wanted men in Colombia . yesterday, a judge issued a warrant for the arrest of Freddy Rodriguez Celades, son of``El Mejicano ,""for the illegal possession of weapons . In recent statements to the press, General Miguel Gomez Padilla, chief of the national police, said that both drug traffickers are in Colombian territory, thus denying reports that they had reportedly moved their bases of operation to Panama or Brazil . Finally, in Cartagena de Indias, a tourist center on the Caribbean coast, a powerful bomb exploded in a hotel, killing two people . The attack was attributed to the drug traffickers, within the framework of an escalation of violence in which over 70 bombs have exploded in a little over 1 month."
523,DEV-MUC3-0524,BOGOTA,1989-09-26,"In a new action attributed to the drug trafficking rings operating in Bogota, a medium-sized bomb partially destroyed a secondary school located in a populous Southern Bogota neighborhood tonight . It was reported that the explosion severely damaged the San Ignacio de Loyola school, located a short distance from a police station . authorities said the explosion caused no casualties, although it resulted in losses amounting to millions . The dynamite attack, the 41St in Bogota during this month, occurred only a few hours after another explosion destroyed one store of a supermarket chain . numerous threats saying that bombs had been planted in schools have been reported in the``war""that the drug cartels have declared in reprisal for the government's intense offensive against them."
524,DEV-MUC3-0525,NO CITY ,1989-09-27,"Some of the arrested persons are Extraditable . The people have risen up against terrorism, and the terrorists cannot hide forever . Third, much international support for Colombia, its democracy, its people, and its government has been mobilized . Colombia is no longer seen as a country of drug traffickers, something it has never been and never will be . Now everyone understands that we are a country of brave people where the majority are honest and Hard-Working . the world has acknowledged and praised democracy in Colombia, the victim of a problem it has not created . Fourth, investigations into the crimes committed by Narcoterrorists continue giving positive results . more than 25 bands of assassins have been dismantled, and their members have been dispersed . two of the people who participated in the assassination of Luis Carlos Galan have confessed to the crime . The Department of administrative security has identified 110 persons who form part of a Narcoterrorist network . The most important assassinations have been cleared up . Fifth, the authorities have been able to check the terrorists' Counteroffensive, although it cannot be denied that the criminals are still capable of causing much damage . This has been made evident by the explosives they have placed, the people who have died and who have been injured, and the fires they have produced . The authorities have been able to frustrate many attacks . criminals who have carried out attacks have been captured . for example, in Medellin , 35 criminals who were coordinating with the terrorist National liberation Army have been captured . sixth, drug trafficking capabilities have decreased . Now there is much less cocaine in the United States and in other world markets . It is important to emphasize the fact that it is up to the United States and the European countries to increase their activities to diminish and control drug consumption . If there were no addicts in those countries, there would be no drug trafficking . This is not the only responsibility of the other countries involved in the war against drug trafficking . If drug traffickers were unable to use their money through international banks and investment opportunities that other countries offer, the incentives for the business would vanish . If the chemical products that are necessary to process cocaine did not arrive in our country from Europe and the United States, the drug could not be produced . If the International arms market were under control, the terrorists would not have been able to get the arms they have used to spill so much blood in Colombia."

He said that the 39 former Gn members will be released when the Counterrevolution is Demobilized in Honduras, as was agreed with the 21 Nicaraguan political parties . The 39 former Somozist Army members, who are so strongly defended by more than one representative who allege quote humanitarian Unquote reasons, are going to stay in prison and will not be included in the list . Likewise, the rest of the Contra prisoners, who are not on this list, will also remain in prison . They will remain there until we have have clear, definite indications from the U.S. government and the mercenaries that they are going to comply with agreements . They will stay in prison until we can clearly see the demobilization of the Contras and their willingness to enter into the country's political activity . We are not going to allow the word reconciliation to be changed into Demagoguery . This word has real meaning . We are willing to comply with agreements and have evidenced our willingness with gestures of generosity . We are not asking the Contras to be generous . We are asking the Contras to comply with the Tela agreements signed in Honduras . We are also asking for compliance with the agreements signed with the political parties during the National dialogue, that the persons who have been Kidanapped by the Contras be returned, and that they stop their attacks and murders that even now--although some politicians are blind to this--continue."

The ruling was issued on the night of 25 September and revealed on 26 September . Hoyos was kidnapped on 25 January 1988 and was found dead 8 hours later near the Medellin airport . Pastrana was kidnapped on 22 January 1988 but was rescued by the Army 3 days later . The``Extraditables""claimed credit at the time for these two actions . in his first ruling, Judge Francisco Cardenas said``There is not sufficient grounds or evidence""for linking Escobar Gaviria and Rodriguez Gacha, the main Chieftains of the Medellin drug cartel, to the crimes .

529,DEV-MUC3-0530,LA PAZ,1989-09-28,"Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora has stated that Bolivia needs adequate assistance to solve its problems . He added that Bolivia needs a leader like Noriega to attract international attention . in a news conference with U.S. reporters, president Paz yesterday answered several questions about the struggle against drug trafficking and the eradication of Coca crops . The Bolivian President stressed the efforts made by the Bolivian people to overcome Hyperinflation of more than 27,000 percent . He said that inflation is predicted to reach 12 percent during his administration . Paz Zamora stated that the highly industrialized countries must pay attention to nations such as Bolivia that face difficult economic situations and at the same time struggle against drug trafficking . He criticized the behavior of world powers, and he said that such behavior must be changed . We are sick and tired of the way industrialized countries and their people are behaving, maintaining certain Sadomasochistic relations with the underdeveloped nations . The Bolivian President tried to make the U.S. press understand the indifference that certain countries, namely the economic powers, show toward Bolivia . to explain his remarks, he said that perhaps a general should assume power, and military forces should besiege the U.S. Embassy, and a few hundred people should be murdered to get the attention of the world . Paz Zamora demanded greater understanding from the International organizations that impose extremely difficult conditions for achieving economic stability . does a war kill more people than an economic adjustment program, the Bolivian President asked . He invited the U.S. reporters to review the statistics on the number of people killed in the Salvadoran war and the number of people who died in Bolivia because of the Economic-Financial adjustments . President Paz has stated that the fact that Bolivia is a Coca- producing country is directly related to the U.S . treatment of the matter . He said that the struggle against drug trafficking demands action to control consumption . He added that Bolivia is not receiving the necessary resources to deal with the social problems resulting from the reduction of Coca production . An Antinarcotics program for Bolivia similar to that implemented in Colombia would be a great mistake . He demanded real alternatives for work and production for Bolivian peasants . He said that until this is achieved, the mistakes of the past will be repeated."

Our communique States that we are searching for democracy and peace . We mention them in that order because if we were to seek peace first, as the government wants, we would have the peace of death . You referred to combatants and the people's movement . However, in the past few days other people have been in the forefront of the struggle against the Fascist regime; that is, the Fmln maimed . What is your opinion about their plight and attitude? the struggle of the people's movement involving individuals who wage important battles without weapons is quite admirable . I believe that the struggle of the war maimed is twice as admirable . They are not only waging a battle without weapons, but with their mutilated bodies . The people's movement is experiencing very trying moments . It is facing repression . This shows the regime as it really is . The maimed have also dealt a very important blow: they have exposed the brutality and stupidity of Army leaders who set up Antiriot Cordons, surrounded the cathedral, and threatened people who are unable to walk or are missing a limb . It is really a heroic struggle much like the ones that many maimed comrades have waged from their jails . They have opened the way for other comrades to leave the country . I think this is to be added to the fact that all of the people's forces who have taken up the banner of peace and democracy, even the War-Disabled, have contributed to our effort with their sacrifice."

Rodriguez Zuniga is said to be an important Medellin cartel connection . Rodriguez Zuniga was arrested several weeks ago in Cartagena and, with the executive branch's consent, could be the second person Extradited to the United States, part of the government's offensive against the drug Mafias that started a month and a half ago . On 6 September the alleged``financial head""of the Medellin cartel, Eduardo Martinez Romero, was sent to the United States after Washington presented documentation to have him tried in an Atlanta court . drug enforcement Administartion investigations report that Martinez Romero was a key person in the``washing""of approximately $1.2 billion the mafia obtained from the cocaine business . The drug``barons""have publicly threatened to murder 10 judges for each Colombian Exradited to another country . Since Martinez Romero was sent to Atlanta there have been hundreds of dynamite attacks in different Colombian cities .

532,DEV-MUC3-0533,BOGOTA,1989-09-24,"What is the truth over the signing of the decrees? were they signed only after the attack on Luis Carlos Galan? the decrees were being studied since noon on the day of his death . It had been a very tough week . The magistrate and the colonel had been murdered; Galan was murdered that evening . There was much discussion over the drafts, but I believe that the attack on Galan hurried things up . in the case of the Extradition decree, we were all aware that it was not a popular measure . philosophically, most ministers did not like the idea of COLOMBIANS being tried abroad . There was much legal discussion, not only to do with this case, but also over the new measures concerning raids, seizures, and arrests . However, finally there was a great determination to give the country answers . the country's current problems have much to do with the Extradition decree . We must not forget that these measures are not against a group of people, but against violence . Extradition has been a very tough measure for everyone . The inconveniences and the legality of this decree, as well as the possible reactions against it, were discussed a great deal . It can be that part of the violence generated has been due to the Extradition decree . is it possible to begin a dialogue with the drug traffickers as a way of ending the country's violence? the government said no to the dialogue, but we must wait and see how events develop . I do not believe that a government's decision can be strict, because situations do change . The President has said that dialogue is impossible . You never know, things may change in the future . anyway, in Colombia practically no wars have ended, because in nearly all wars an agreement was reached . But if Colombia holds a dialogue, the world's doors will probably close on Colombia . look, in the United States I was asked about the Extradition and I said it was not popular, that it was not going to solve the drug trafficking problem . It is not the government's stance, but if it is decided to hold a dialogue, then this would be a sovereign Colombian decision . Obviously, if the position changes a bad impression will be given . The government has been very clear that it has not lost its sovereignty . The Internatinal press feels a little disappointed with your resignation . One must not forget that you became a symbol for the foreign journalists when you traveled to Washington . I held a news conference on 22 September and I told them that my resignation was not Monica de Greiff's position, but the government's . I told them I was staying in the country, and I explained to them that the ministers here remain at their posts until the President decides otherwise . However, they did not understand why . What will Monica de Greiff do? I am going to rest for a few days and then return . I am going to help Ernesto Samper's campaign . I also believe that working for private enterprise will be a good opportunity . What post has given you the greatest satisfaction? When I was at the Ministry of Mines and energy . It was fascinating . I had two very good bosses: Guillermo Perry and Oscar Mejia . I worked in delightful harmony with a group of good people . I believe that mining and hydrocarbons is the sector that has enjoyed the greatest progress under this government . What is your final feeling upon leaving the Ministry? every cloud has a silver lining . I have been spared from many boring things . I have not had to sign Extradition orders or things like that . Without realizing it, I have been spared of tiring things."

In statements to a local television station, Santamaria said the proposal will be officially presented to the Rebel leaders during the second round of the dialogue, which will be held 16 - 17 October in San Jose, Costa Rica . Santamaria, who is the Alfredo Cristiani government dialogue Commission spokesman, met for the first time with the Fmln leaders on 13 , 14, and 15 September in Mexico city . On 21 September, defense Minister general Humberto Larios, for the first time in the 9 years of war, said that reducing the number of Army troops, as demanded by the rebels, is feasible . He said the government is drafting a document on the cease-fire that it will present at the Costa Rica meeting . During the Mexico meeting the parties in conflict agreed to hold meetings to try to reach an agreement on the war, which has resulted in 70,000 deaths over a 9-Year period . Despite the dialogue, the guerrillas this week launched one of the most violent military campaigns yet, which even affected San Salvador . This guerrilla campaign is in response to``increasing repression and assassinations""of labor leaders . The only issue to be discussed at the Costa Rica meeting will be the cease-fire . The two parties have expressed confidence that an agreement will be reached before the end of this year . In addition to the reduction in the number of Army troops, the rebels proposed in Mexico that the judicial branch be reorganized and that a Prosecutor be appointed as a result of a consensus between the government and the political parties . In response to a question about the intensification of the armed struggle by the rebels, Santamaria said:``We are at a stage where the tension level is declining . We have found points of agreement, and we and will honor them . ''"
534,DEV-MUC3-0535,SAN SALVADOR,1989-09-29,"We report to you the following considerations related to the present situation in the search for a just and lasting peace in El Salvador . 1 . We note with deep concern that there has been an alarming increase in human rights and humanitarian war norms violations by the government and the armed forces . These violations can be observed in the repression of demonstrations, tortures, murders, arrests--more than 400 in the past month--Disapearances, and in the government's refusal to allow maimed Farabundo Marti National liberation front members to leave the country to get medical attention . This norm is stipulated in the Geneva convention, and this is an agreement that has been signed by the Salvadoran government . This situation has been clearly demonstrated by the resolution issued by the Subcommission period in August 1989 . Mr Cristiani said this resolution was not truthful . 2 . government spokesmen and Mr Cristiani himself have repeatedly stated that the achievement of peace depends on the Fmln's halting hostilities . This presents a unilateral plan that has not been agreed upon politically, militarily, or operationally . In contrast to these statements, when the Fmln unilaterally declared a truce recently, Mr Cristiani, officials in his administration, and military commanders stated that these Fmln measures were propagandistic and that the truce was not respected . their arguments were attempts to justify the government's breaking of the truce . These events give us additional grounds for stating that a definite and unconditional halt to hostilities is unrealistic and Unfeasible."
535,DEV-MUC3-0536,BOGOTA,,"Recent expressions of solidarity and support for Colombia have greatly encouraged us in these trying times . We are now living in different times, but the situation is no less critical than the one that led to the emergence of the United Nations . a new world war has been declared by an aggressor that does not respect the traditional rules of war or national sovereignty . The aggressor is a pernicious International criminal organization that has great power and resources and that is nourished by illegal revenues generated by drug trafficking . as the UN Secretary General recently said, and I quote: the illegal use of and trafficking in drugs today is seen as a social plague that affects both industrialized and developing countries . Although efforts to fight this scourge have increased in recent years, Statistics show that the monetary value of drug trafficking is greater than that of the international oil trade and is only surpassed by arms trafficking . It is certainly worrisome to see that mankind is so deeply involved in trafficking degradation and death . end of the Secretary General's statement . The members of these criminal cartels were born in various countries, and many of their leaders are believed to be COLOMBIANS . Although it is true that some of them may have been born in my country, I must clarify that they are COLOMBIANS in name only . They are really just international fugitives who have no home . Colombia is not their homeland! I am also here at the United Nations to present to you the crude reality of this war against drug trafficking . Colombia is on the frontline of this battle . for us it is not a war of words . Many COLOMBIANS have died because of their firm commitment against drug trafficking . approximately 1 month ago, Luis Carlos Galan, one of the most prestigious political leaders in my country, was assassinated . his death has Consolidated even more the nation's will and has drawn the world's attention to the problem . However, many COLOMBIANS have died over the years--as he did--as victim of drug trafficking . that long list includes 12 magistrates of the Supreme Court, an attorney general, and a justice Minister . prominent Congressmen, judges, Mayors, journalists, thousands of soldiers, policemen, and Colombian citizens have given their lives for democracy . last month, after announcing exceptional measures against drug trafficking, which were decreed by the government in accordance with the state of siege, drug traffickers have continued and intensified their terrorist actions."

Spaniard Jose Maria Martinez, Frenchman Roberto Lisandy, and Italian Dino Rossy, who were staying at a Tecun Uman hotel, were kidnapped by armed men who took them to an unknown place . After they were released, the three Europeans went to the regional police station and gave a full account of their experience with the kidnappers . Martinez told the police that the kidnappers held them in a dark room and questioned them .

537,DEV-MUC3-0538,BOGOTA,1989-09-25,"The self-determination of peoples means nations have the ability to settle their domestic problems by themselves . based on this view, several of the country's most oustanding Democrats and Dupes denounced foreign military aid to fight drug trafficking, a scourge that became an international problem a long time ago and is weakening Colombian sovereignty . I have no doubt that those who are now most opposed to the presence of U.S. military advisers and experts are those who regard this presence as a serious obstacle to the armed organizations they promote and that are trained by Libyan, British, Cuban, and Israeli experts . It is obvious that sovereignty is the most important element for the existence of a state . However, we lost our sovereignty long ago and to regain it we must accept all the aid the honest international community can offer us . sovereignty, among other things, means adopting decisions based on the needs or preferences of the nation as a whole . that stopped happening in Colombia when the drug traffickers began to intimidate and destroy the legitimate institutions of the state . How can we talk of sovereignty when we see that our people have fallen prey to terrorism; that they are living and dying enslaved by daily bombings and lies; that they are governing under the pressure of threats; that they have sought refuge in a home imprisoned by fear? it is absurd to talk of a truly sovereign state when it is known that several of the country's top political and business leaders are involved in criminal activities . an act of sovereignty--one in the midst of so much subjugation--would be to strip ourselves of so much vain pride and accept the fact that we are weak and need all the help offered by anyone whose intentions are based on the law . Moreover, it is ironic that several of those who are clamoring for``the defense of sovereignty""are the same ones who are now asking the U.S. government to explain the cancellation of Visas . is it not a matter of national sovereignty to decide who can and cannot enter that country? I am reminded of those thousands of cases of food and medicine donated to Colombia following the Armero catastrophe that Rotted in the country's customs warehouses . Armero is the burial ground for 30,000 COLOMBIANS and the scene of the tragedy of thousands more . Despite the regrettable end that this aid met in so many warehouses, nobody opposed International solidarity with that corner of Tolima Department . The war on drug traffickers could bury us . Let us struggle for Sovereingty and accept the advice offered by the United States, or we will end up rotting in a warehouse filled with white powder."

This was learned by our correspondent from sources close to Israeli companies dealing with the sale of security know-how . The London observer, quoting Peruvian Congress members, reported that evidence concerning Israeli involvement in the training of a right-wing terrorist organization in Lima disappeared from the files of a congressional Commission probing Israeli involvement in Peru . Our correspondent Hanan 'Azran has more details: the reports in the London observer apparently stem from Left-Wing circles and Peruvian guerrilla groups . The most prominent group is the shining path, a guerrilla group aiming to overthrow the regime . These circles contend that Israelis train what they term the right-wing death, or terror, squads . They apparently refer to the Rodrigo Franco commando units, to which the liquidation of guerrilla members and of opponents to the regime is attributed . political circles in Jerusalem have said that these claims of Israeli involvement in the training of death squads are groundless . Israeli companies are involved in military training and in maneuvers in Peru . Israeli experts have set up the Peruvian Army's Antiterror squad . one of the squad's founders was Gabi Kohen, a former Israel police Antiterror unit commander . Gabi Kohen was a partner in the Dat company, which offered similar training and instruction services to additional countries in Latin America and elsewhere in the world . Dat operated in Peru with the permit of Sibat, the defense Ministry defense sales Department . One member of the company was a senior border police officer, former border police commander Tzvi bar, who retired from the company after a short period, turning to other enterprises . One company with diverse operations in Peru was the Isds owned by Leo Glaser, also an Idf elite unit graduate . Isds had permanent offices in Lima headed by ran Gazit, who later opened a business of his own elsewhere . The company had defense Ministry approval for its work in Peru . According to its directors, it trained security guards for civilian businesses only, including the use of firearms and protection measures."

Now we are witnessing the collapse of the illusions and of the possibilities of totalitarian and Collectivist systems . It seems that peace is being consolidated . the world powers have agreed to work for a better understanding and more rational relations . the world is becoming increasingly interdependent . Our modern knowledge, science, technology, and resources have overcome borders and limitations . the same is true of the international community . These problems, therefore, are a challenge for world cooperation and this organization . one of the greatest challenges facing the international community today is the drafting of effective programs to fight drug trafficking . We support Colombia for its courage to face the powerful criminal organizations that are using the nation for their own purposes . Chile has implemented a strict preventive program to control the most dangerous manifestations of the problem . We are not a drug producing country . We are victims of drug trafficking . In one of its first decisions on the problem, in September 1973, the government expelled a group of foreign drug traffickers who had established themselves in northern Chile, taking advantage of the prevailing political and social crisis . We are convinced that countries cannot fight the problem alone . the world has declared war on drugs . We must be aware that transitory victories will not eradicate the problem . only with proper education will we be able to nurture the strength of our youth, alert them to the dangers of drug consumption, and prevent them from becoming victims . The international community must assign the necessary resources to implement efficient education programs . We have expressed concern about terrorism for many years . Today we want to reiterate our rejection and repudiation of terrorism . Chileans are especially sensitive to terrorism because we continuously experience their cowardly and irresponsible attacks . We have often seen how some nations receive confessed terrorists who ask for political Asylum . If modern societies want to defeat terrorism and Narcoterrorism, they will have to act decisively . terrorists should not be given refuge or protection anywhere . Some International organizations have permitted the systematic manipulation of the issue of human rights for political reasons . The parties involved in such manipulation have tried to include the legitimate right of a nation to defend itself from terrorism and subversion in the definition of human right violations . It is not that we deny the inalienable rights of people . We condemn the gross manipulation of the issue of human rights . This manipulation shows that those parties do not respect human rights themselves . human rights should be respected by all nations without exception . It is not fair to pass judgment on countries like Chile that had to struggle hard to overcome the difficulties created by terrorism and subversion . terrorism set foot in Chile as a consequence of disruption in the institutional order between 1970 and 1973 . Those passing judgment must consider the general situation that provoked the collapse of peaceful coexistence . In Chile we have built a society in which human rights are protected not only by democratic institutions and the law, but also by the Chilean people's willingness to respect individual rights, values, and beliefs . those rights are also protected by today's spirit of coexistence."

The possibility of expelling Panama from the group was discussed even though Argentine foreign minister Domingo Cavallo said the issue was not on the agenda . Asked about the possible ousting of Panama from the group of eight and replacing it with Ecuador, Argentine foreign minister Domingo Cavallo told Efe:``We are going to listen to the proposal, but we prefer not to comment for the time being . We will see within the context of the meeting what the basis for that proposal is .""Cavallo added:``We do not have proposals or initiatives any different from the issues to be discussed on Panama .""Mexican foreign minister Fernando Solana told Efe that the preparatory foreign ministers meeting will discuss the Panamanian issue and that Mexico will decide its stance``at the appropriate time .""Brazilian foreign minister Roberto de Abreu said in this city yesterday that Brazil has an individual position``but will accept and support a joint agreement .""Peruvian foreign minister Guillermo Larco Cox also said yesterday that Peru will propose``the final separation of Panama""from the group of eight .

Cox added:``We must work for overall development . We propose as an act of justice the integration of the continent which is necessary for the economic and social development of our people .""he added that the integration process cannot be an isolated process and that unity can only be effective if the countries rescue the historic values which consolidated the independence of the Americas . The ministers also discussed, in addition to the Panamanian and Ecuadoran case, the drug trafficking problem, joint action to deal with the region's foreign debt, estimated at $420 billion, and terrorism .

561,DEV-MUC3-0562,HAVANA ,1989-10-10,"Greetings comrade . Guatemala always comes up in Central American news . We know little about Guatemala . International news agencies block reports from Guatemala . We have learned that in addition to the atmosphere of chaos and instability, repression has increased in the last 7 months . It was reported recently that 2,000 people have been killed , 2,500 wounded--many of them crippled--and hundreds--over 800 are missing . We have taken the opportunity of a visit paid by Mr Rodrigo Asturias, who is member of the Urng military directorate and is also known as commander Gaspar, not only in Guatemala and central America but throughout the world, to talk and clear some matters pertaining to Guatemala . commander Gaspar: some steps have been taken to find a negotiated solution . that is, steps have been taken to begin a dialogue between the guerrilla and the Guatemalan government . Some journalists and specialists wonder if the search for a negotiated solution is compatible with the situation prevailing in Guatemala . What could you tell us about this? I believe this is an interesting question that needs to be clarified . at the end of September, the Urng general command made a new proposal aimed at finding a political solution to the internal armed conflict our country is experiencing . The proposal to find a political solution and to establish a dialogue as a first step to create the conditions is very important because it entails an increased effort in the struggle for democracy . We do not think of dialogue and negotiation as a demobilization element but as an extremely active element, as a clarifying element, to find and put in place consensus with democratic solutions . This is why although there has been, in fact, an increase of repression--which by the way, it was brutally intensified last month--the proposal to find a political solution and the call all national sectors, without exception, to begin contacts, talks, and dialogue with the Unrg despite the fact that the government continues to refuse them and continues maintaining a closed position . It is an important step in the Democratic struggle . commander Gaspar, insisting in the last part of your response, what are the basis in which this type of talks and dialogue could be initiated? since October 1987, when its first dialogue initiative was established, the general command has said Preestablished conditions are not necessary but that the country's fundamental problems should be included in the dialogue and the preparation of the agenda . The main problem the country has and has had in the last few years is the lack of respect toward human rights, the Militarization of the Guatemalan society, and the generalized oppression experienced . Therefore, we believe the main point that needs to be addressed in the agenda is the democratization . Speaking of the internal situation from the military point of view, news agency report every day of missing persons, killings, and tortures . are the ones everyone knows as the death squadrons increasing their activities? indeed, there has been an increase in repression . We could say without being mistaken that there is a terrorist escalation headed by state security forces . It is very important to denounce and to be clear on this because the ones that are carrying out this repression and the ones that are taking forward this terror campaign are not paramilitary groups as the people have been led to believe and they are not Extreme-Right civilian groups . They are Army operative groups that act based on information, charges, suspicions, or many times blindly to see what information they can find, in what way they can hit or infiltrate the people's and revolutionary movement . We are faced with an escalation of the strongest state terrorism . It cannot be confused with death squadrons or differences within the right wing . The Army is the one responsible of the repression."

Avello , 34, native of Santa Marta, had been arrested in early 1988 for illegal possession of weapons on the Atlantic coast . shortly after Luis Carlos Galan's assassination, the U.S. government asked for his Extradition, bearing in mind that the Federal Court in Oklahoma is trying him for drug trafficking . His Extradition is taken for Grantyed, and it is believed that it will take place once all legal requirements are met, which will not be before 1 week . Das sources said that mono Avello offered 100 million pesos to the six detectives who arrested him last night at an exclusive restaurant in Bogota's northern section . The authorities had been trailing him in Bogota for several days . The Army has occupied several of his properties on the Atlantic Coast and has seized vehicles and yachts belonging to him .

564,DEV-MUC3-0565,SAN SALVADOR,1989-10-10,"Several Salvadoran sectors have condemned the murder of the wife of the deputy editor of El Diario de Hoy . She was riddled with bullets near the central American University this morning . Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani has described the action as terrorist . He said this is a flagrant violation of human rights, which will surely also be condemned by the UN high Commissioner for human rights, pastor Ribrejo, who is in the country . The last straw is that terrorists, without any risk to themselves, kill defenseless women . This particular lady was accompanied by her children, one of whom was wounded . We think this is the limit . We are not sure who did it, but, considering the nature of the action, it appears to be a terrorist crime . We already know who Perpetrates such actions . We think this is part of what the Fmln has been doing . They have been silencing voices that uphold philosophies that run contrary to their's . referring to the presence of pastor Ribrejo in the country, Cristiani said the UN official will be able to confirm that the policy of the Salvadoran government and armed forces does not fit the violation of the human rights . I will not refer to Monsignor Arturo Rivera Y Damas alone, but to all of the organizations linked to the Fmln that have been trying to discredit the government . I think Dr Ribrejo will be able to confirm that neither the government nor the armed forces are in the habit of violating human rights . I think if one tries to be objective and realistic, he will realize that the Fmln has been trying to make the homeland fall into a state of total anarchy . I think the armed forces have acted very professionally . The government's policy has been to try to seek solutions through reason rather than violence . These events must be seen in the light of what the Fmln said it would do . It said it would unleash even greater violence . As for the upcoming dialogue meeting to be held in San Jose on 16 and 17 October, Cristiani said a Commission is ready to resume talks with the Fmln, to which a cease-fire will be proposed, among other things . Cristiani said that the Costa Rican government has reported working on the logistics of the meeting so the talks can be held in peace."

According to Merino, who is also the Salvadoran vice president, the refugees' determination to return without the government's approval is``evidence""of their relations with the Salvadoran guerrillas . However, the refugees--including women, the elderly, and children--denied any links with the Farabundo Marti National liberation front guerrillas . Merino interpreted the refugees' wishes to repatriate in a massive and immediate manner as``plans to provoke problems that will affect the image of the government with regard to the issue of respecting human rights .""on 10 October, an official Commission, headed by deputy interior Minister Colonel Carlos Figueroa visited the Honduran camp at Mesa Grande to try to reach an agreement with the refugees so they could prepare for their repatriation in 1990 and agree on the places where they would be relocated .

Cuba may join the OAS . We have no objections to it . As for Panama, it continues to belong to the OAS but not to the group of eight . Panama has been suspended temporarily from this group until democracy returns to that country . This will be stated in a document we are preparing during this meeting . is the pardon for military officers and terrorists in Argentina damaging the moral health of your country or Argentina democracy? no, because this is not the first time a pardon has been granted in the world . There have been Pardons everywhere . not long ago a pardon was granted in Uruguay and it has been ratified by the Uruguayan people . A pardon was granted in Spain after the . There were Pardons granted after the second World War . Pardons and forgetting have allowed the integration of the European Economic community . It also allowed President Bush to pay Hommage to Emperor Hiroito, one of those responsible for the second World War, during his funeral . Therefore we can completely overcome this matter . reported that Argentina would ask to participate in the summit meeting of the Presidents of Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia and the United States . is this true, and what would be the Argentine role in this summit? no, that is not correct . We support this summit meeting, and continue maintaining our same attitude toward the fight against drug trafficking . We currently do not differentiate between Coca producer and Coca consumer countries . They are both part of a same process, so we must carry out an all out war against the three phases of drug production and merchandising . a stronger action is required by especially the United States to fight drug trafficking . I think that we need the will of every one . We would not gain anything by restricting the production of Coca in Peru, Colombia, and Bolivia if the United States does not help to substitute this crop . We cannot divide this action . The fight must be an all out war by all the countries of the world, because drugs are currently present in all countries . There is not a single country that can claim that there is no drug Addiciton or trafficking in its territory . not long ago, I read that 14 drug traffickers were hanged in Saudi Arabia, where they are very conservative and where there is strict control over any kind of vice . What position has Argentina maintained throughout this meeting regarding the foreign debt issue? do you think all the group of eight members will arrive to a joint position regarding this issue? we are currently renegotiating our debts individually because each country is different . The economic policies have so far not been integrated but they must be integrated . As long as we do not attain integration, the foreign debt negotiations will be carried out individually . If we make progress towards integration, things may change for the benefit of all . for the time being the negotiations will be carried out separately . President Alan Garcia yesterday called for the establishment of concrete integration goals for 1992 . has this been discussed by the Presidents? will concrete goals be fixed? we are discussing this . We have already set concrete goals, based on experiences . for example we have an economic integration with Brazil, which Uruguay recently joined . This must serve as an example for the rest of the Latin American countries . of course we must not forget some of the positive results, like in the case of the Andean pact which is reviving and reorganizing itself, and other agreements not only in Latin America but in the whole American continent . We are heading toward a Continental unity like that of Canada and the United States . After Latin America achieves integration we want integration with central and northern America . President Virgilio Barco was surprised, because he thought that the crew of the three planes we donated to Colombia had already returned to Argentina . However, they are still there waiting for the airplanes to be placed at the service of the struggle against drug trafficking."
571,DEV-MUC3-0572,LIMA,1989-10-12,"There are serious discrepancies among the Preesidents attending to this meeting regarding the foreign debt issue . is it because of the different situations prevailing in each country? we have a common stance . No country can pay what it is being asked to pay . We all know this . people know it . The labor unions know it . Therefore, that is our stance . a few years ago some countries made an effort to pay . Nowaday, everybody knows they cannot pay and they are struggling to change the payment conditions . This is the basic issue that we all share . The fact that some countries resort to the Brady plan, that others seek other alternatives, or that others choose not to pay a debt that they consider to be unfair--at Leat until conditions change or payments are reduced--are simply different shades of a common stance . The important point is that we are gradually Verifying that no country is able to pay the debt in contracted, a debt that has grown only because of interests . I will reiterate some dramatic but realistic figures : 10 years ago Latin America owed $190 billion . It paid $289 billion to December 1988--that is 10 years--and it still owes $430 billion . in the past 10 years Latin America has reduced its per capita consumption dramatically by 2 to 3 percent a year . in the past 10 years Latin America reduced its imports, seeking to spend less dollars . It increased its exports and devalued its currencies to obtain dollars with which to pay the debt . in the past 10 years Latin America grew only 1 percent per year, and it has used that 1 percent, plus an additional 4-Percent of its GNP, to pay the debt . Therefore, under these conditions , 10 years later we find that we owe more, produce less, and it is impossible to pay our debt . We all know this . It has cost us 10 years to understand it . However it is an experience that constitutes the base for our common stance . has progress been made in this field since the Punta del Este summit? would there have been a Brady plan if we had not met in Acapulco or in Punta del Este? one of James Brady's advisers published an article in the New York Times stating that the Brady plan was announced in September 1985 to prevent the dissemination of the Peruvian attitude of unilaterally reducing its debt payments . who knows if the Acapulco and Punta del Este meetings have not led the creditors to acknowledge that the debt is not worth its face value and that it must be reduced? therefore, there has been progress . who knows if next year we will be speaking of reducing the debt by 50 percent and not just the 20 percent that we now seek? You see, the fact is that not only are we unable to pay and that we are negotiating to pay less, but the creditors also know that they will not be able to collect their money if they insist on their claims . Therefore, if the United States and the Soviet Union are heading to ward disarmament, why can't there be a financial disarmament between the rich and poor? I think that economic trends will follow this line . President, why hasn't Panama been definitively expelled from this group, and will the group of eight expand? Panama as a country, independent of its past administrations, was a founder member of the group of eight . No country can be expelled . This is a term that would offend the citizenry of a country . We simply ratified the suspension of Panama indefinitely until Panama is governed by a democratically elected government . that was our decision . The OAS? we are preparing a proposal in which we state that the OAS is an important forum or mechanism for hemispheric dialogue but which must include the presence of Cuba and other countries which are yet not members . will the group of eight expand? I hope so . This is the last year in which I will attend a meeting of the group of eight, which I helped to create . However, I hope this group will lead annual and periodical meetings of all Latin America Presidents . I have maintained this hope since 1985 . I hope that Latin America will annually coordinate some kind of Collegial executive branch to make important decisions . The group of eight is the beginning of this, and I am sure that it will expand in the future . However, at a Continental level, the issues cannot run as fast as for a country, a people, or a political process . A continent requires much longer terms and we must be patient . Let us go to another subject now . human rights . two of the main issues in Latin American life are democratization and human rights . President Menem has recently pardoned military officers and terrorists who were serving prison sentences . There is also a Conflictive situation in Peru regarding some military officers who are being tried for murders committed in jails . are you willing to pardon those military officers to pacify the situation? this is my first question . Second, the Peruvian image through the International media is very bad because of a lack of information . In contrast with Acapulco and Punta del Este, which are holiday Resorts with multimillion dollar Infrastructures, the city of ICA represents thousands of Latin American cities . Therefore, what is your administration doing to Thruthfully report on Peruvian reality? Tion doing to Thruthfully report on Peruvian reality?"

573,DEV-MUC3-0574,QUITO,1989-10-12,"This year, France will grant Ecuador a 310 Million-Franc loan and a Non-Repayable loan for 20 million . France will also provide technical assistance, and will support Ecuador's struggle against drug traffickers and its efforts to solve Ecuador's foreign debt problem, Presidents Francois Mitterrand and Rodrigo Borja announced today in Quito . Thus, the French aid to Ecuador in 1989 will total 400 million francs, since France previously agreed to grant loans for 180 million francs to Ecuador . The announcement was made on 12 October, shortly before Mitterrand concluded his official 2-Day visit to Ecuador, where he held a private meeting with Borja--a fellow member of Socialist international--after Ecuadoran foreign minister Diego Cordovez and Edwige Avice, delegate from the French Ministry of foreign affairs, signed an letter of intention . from the total loans , 165 million francs will be used for the first phase of a project to rehabilitate the central railroad . The project includes the rehabilitation of 900 km of the railway line between the Ecuadoran mountain range and the Ecuadoran coast, Borja said . He revealed that the loan is to be paid back in 25 years, with a 5-Year grace period and low interest rates . He also noted the social significance of the project, in a country with difficult and rugged terrain . The remaining funds will be used to supply Potable water to the provinces of Imbabura in the mountain range, and Manabi in the Coastal region . with regard to Ecuador's foreign debt, which exceeds $11 billion, Mitterrand said he is``willing to personally assist ,""in the study of bilateral agreements to reduce the debt burden, and to Intercede before the Paris Club, to which Ecuador owes $400 million . Mitterrand asked Borja to give him time to study the bilateral agreements on the debt . In this regard, Mitterrand clearly expressed that the debt will not be forgiven . He believes this is an overall problem and is``more dangerous than the atomic bomb ,""because the countries facing this problem cannot control it .""at the same time, Miterrand asked:``who can control the misery and the disturbances""this problem will generate? Mitterrand added that efforts will be made to improve the weak bilateral trade, which in 1988 totalled 321.3 million francs, with a deficit of 56.5 million francs for Ecuador . Mitterrand said French experts will study the possibility of boosting sales of Ecuadoran products to France, especially seafood products, such as shrimp, as well as bananas, which France currently BUYS from African countries .``what we want to do is open new doors ,""Mitterrand added . However, he insisted on the need to wait for the studies the experts will carry out . The Chiefs of state announced the signing of a cooperation agreement to struggle against drug trafficking, still at an early stage in Ecuador . through this agreement, signed by Ecuadoran government Minister Andres Vallejo and French interior Minister Pierre Joxe, a plan will be drafted to struggle against this scourge . France will provide electronic equipment and other supplies to the Ecuadoran police . Mitterrand said he thoroughly discussed this problem with Borja, although this is not a specific problem of Ecuador, which is not a producing country, but is used for the transshipment of drugs . He made an appeal to organize a world front to eliminate this scourge . Borja confirmed Mitterrand's statements and added that although Ecuador``is not a Drug-Producing country, we will not rest ,""because I believe other countries``began late""in their struggle against this evil . The two Presidents agreed on the need to concerted efforts--among countries producing and consuming drugs, countries used for the transshipment of drugs, and for money laundering--to face this scourge . The two Presidents committed their efforts in this respect . Mitterrand, who upon concluding his visit to Ecuador will make a stopover in Bogota, said that his unscheduled visit to Colombian President Virgilio Barco is``to give open testimony on the solidarity that must be given to the President of such a courageous government . Finally, Mitterrand noted the benefits of his visit to Ecuador--which he expects to repeat--and the enthusiastic welcoming he received . Borja thanked this``great European and world leader, who is offering his friendship to us ,""for his visit."

According to reports received in Bogota, the newsman , 57, was about to enter his home when he was gunned down by several armed men . Bendeck Olivella had been press assistant to Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza, but went to Colombia after the triumph of the Sandinist revolution . Bendeck Olivella is the second newsman to be murdered this week . on Tuesday, several gunmen killed Roberto Sarasty Botero, who worked for the Caracol radio network in Medellin . Although the authorities do not yet have detailed information, the possibility that Bendeck Olivella may have been murdered for political reasons has not been ruled out since he was a political specialist . for more than a month, newsmen in Colombia have been facing a serious threat from the drug trafficking mafia, which even partially destroyed the main offices of the Bogota morning paper El Espectador, in reprisal for the paper's harsh attacks on the cocaine trafficking organizations."
575,DEV-MUC3-0576,MOSCOW ,1989-10-12,"We had been left completely alone and isolated from the world, the popular government had been overthrown, the dictatorship had scattered concentration camps and anonymous dead around the country, Congress was closed, all leftist communication media were also closed, and the image of the dictatorship monopolized the television screens . Pinochet needed to be left alone in order to consolidate his power by murdering his opponents . at the same time, he sent missions abroad to seek recognition and support . in the first days immediately after the coup, radio Moscow began to beam programs to Chile, and I am now talking to you from its studios . Volodia Teitelboim, current Secretary General of the Chilean Communist party, was by chance in Moscow in September 1973, and it fell to him to initiate the programs``Listen, Chile""and radio Magallanes over the microphones of radio Moscow . The audience of these programs suddenly grew inside Chile . At first, the programs denounced the arbitrary action of the military regime . It was difficult to smuggle news out of Chile so that it could be broadcast all over Chile by radio Moscow, but news of the world's solidarity was broadcast night after night to Chile . Thus, the wall of silence the dictator intended to raise around him to hide his crimes was cracked . A tradition of listening radio Moscow programs to Latin America was developed in Chile as attested by the mail that reached its studios . The bulk of mail from Chile CONFIRMS this . So it was easy to see that the Moscow transmissions were helping the cause of the persecuted, the workers, the students, the prisoners, the Muzzled Democrats, and the grieving widows of Chile . through these transmissions, those people received the message of support an encouragement sent by the peoples of the world . The first broadcasts were made in those years, and very few have not listened to them at some time, although nobody admitted to knowledge of those programs . The tyrant himself violently attacked the programs in several public speeches . not long ago, Pinochet's foreign minister again scathingly referred to radio Moscow's broadcasts . that is to say that those programs have continued to affect the dictatorship in one way or another and that they have helped the resurgence of the democratic forces . The resurgence and organization of the democratic forces through the impetus of the workers and broad sectors of the population have reshaped the Chilean political situation, to the point that we are now approaching the real possibility of an electoral triumph by a single opposition candidate to the Presidency, thus setting the process of transition in motion . In fact the situation not only has changed in Chile, but also in the Soviet Union where the Perestroyka--a revolutionary process inside a revolution--has opened immense possibilities for the economic, social, and political development of Soviet society . We frequently keep you abreast of these developments in the programs of radio Moscow . So, all this has galvanized our disposition to continue cooperating in this Proces that has reached new levels . Our programs continue to be open and at the disposal of all advance forces that March with the Democrats . a few weeks ago, radio Moscow completed 16 years of broadcast to Chile . Now, on 29 October radio Moscow will celebrate its 60th anniversary . all the peoples of the world know the programs of radio Moscow in 81 languages . The programs to Chile have a privileged place among them . for the occasion, greetings have been sent to the programs of radio Moscow and radio Magallanes . from Chileans scattered in 40 countries by the Fascist explosion, radio Moscow also receives mail and postcard with messages of appreciation and thanks . This is a modest way of responding to the valuable assistance radio Moscow has given, is giving, and will continue to give us . We had been left alone, isolated from the world, and radio Moscow proved to be our friend during shameful times . good night."

Polay said that he cannot predict the decision that the``revolutionary court""will make after the``people's judgment""to which the impresario will be subjected .

Moreover, it asks the international community of nations and human rights Rapporteur professor pastor Ridrejo to take due notice of this despicable human rights violation carried out by the Fmln at a time when the Salvadoran government delegation is engaged in a dialogue in good faith and with the best political intentions to reach peace, something the Salvadoran people yearn for .

The general public has been banned . These measures were implemented after a paid assassin was killed right in bolivar square by a grenade he was trying to throw at the Congress building . The aborted action by the terrorist on 18 October forced the authorities to reinforce security at the Congress . However, bolivar square was poorly patrolled . Several onlookers arrived at the square early this morning to see where the terrorist was killed when the grenade exploded . those who cannot show proper identity cards will not be admitted . does this include representatives and senators? Yes, anyone who has legitimate business here at the Congress . The measures caused various reactions and angered some Congressmen . why was this Senator not admitted? because he refused to be searched, as everybody must be . searching Congressmen is not very nice, but it would be worse if one were killed . employees did not escape the check either . The police even cordoned off the outside areas near where the commissions work."
586,DEV-MUC3-0587,SAN SALVADOR,1989-10-20,"... which is the overall result, but also analyzed the manner in which this meeting was held because we believe, and we have always believed, that the people must be informed, the people must know the truth . Initially, this second meeting with the Fmln is a Followup to the Mexico accord in September . We want to begin by briefly explaining what the Mexico accord was, particularly what we agreed to discuss in the meeting in San Jose, Costa Rica . We have here the text of the Mexico accord, and in the chapter concerning the next meeting it says: the topic of discussion will be the end of hostilities, based on proposals by the government and the Fmln . In view of the Mexico accord, our delegation began to work on a proposal that would make every possible effort to outline what could be an end to hostilities . Why have we insisted on this topic? because we want an end to violence in our country, the end of weapons firing, the end of bomb explosions, the end of Mines Mutilating the little hands and feet of children in rural areas . We want to see an end to the destruction of El Salvador, and an atmosphere of Cordiality and tranquility with greater possibilities for the dialogue process . that is the Philosphy, because we believe that the Salvadoran people, and each one of you as part of the Salvadoran people, do not deserve this violent situation, this hostile situation generated by the armed groups of the Fmln . The proposal is also based on the central American peace plan, Esquipulas II, and the subsequent agreements signed by the five central American Presidents . I would like to recall the Tela agreement, the last agreement . in part III, the agreement reads as follows: the Fmln is strongly urged to end hostilities in an immediate and effective manner to hold a dialogue that will lead to giving up the armed struggle; the Fmln members will return to democratic life."
587,DEV-MUC3-0588,CLANDESTINE,1989-10-19,"Ruben Zamora, leader of the popular social Christian movement and the Democratic convergence, was unharmed following a terrorist attack . Zamora said the country is suffering from a wave of violence launched by groups that do not want the negotiations to succeed . He also said there are Ultrarightist groups that do not seek a negotiated settlement because they believe their interests will be harmed, and added that there are groups within the armed forces and arena that do not want the negotiations . He said these groups tend to react with increased violence."
588,DEV-MUC3-0589,NO CITY ,1989-10-20,"The Fmln has done nothing but insist on an immediate answer to all of this . logically, I cannot say that their's is a serious position because when a number of documents are put forward, a period of time is required to analyze them . However, the Fmln immediately rejected the government's proposal, saying that it would not accept it . What does this mean? that the Fmln no longer wants to talk about the end of the hostilities, but wants to introduce new topics at the San Jose meeting . However, despite the Fmln's position, and although there has not been an in-depth study of all the documents, one can see at first glance that the proposals they have put forward are totally absurd . I will cite an example: you know very well that the Fmln has admitted to being unable to maintain a position, that if it attempts to occupy a town, in less than 24 hours the armed forces drive it out . It cannot maintain a position in the country . Nevertheless, the Fmln proposal attempts to establish territorial limits with the government . While it is true that the Fmln exists and is a reality, I believe that reality has a dimension, a size . The results of the past elections, the results of something over 3 percent, indicate that the Fmln is a reality but a very small one, and that it does not have the right to force a government and a people to violate their constitutional system . Meanwhile, the Fmln has come up with the totally absurd notion that the government must dismiss the entire class of '66, the defense Minister, and the commander of the Air force . that is totally absurd, it is a ridiculous position that does not truly show any intention to movement toward peace . The Fmln proposal also calls for the government to instruct the legislative Assembly to change all of the Supreme Court justices . These, Salvadoran friends, are totally absurd positions; although these are somewhat different, their previous positions are ever present . The government will not at any time violate the Constitution, it will never question the sacrifices that you and all the Salvadoran people have made during these long years in order to gradually strengthen the democratic process, which may not be perfect--and we would like to discuss different ways of perfecting it--but we will never sell it or sacrifice it, especially under circumstances which, by all means, are absurd . What is worse, however, is that along with the attitude the Fmln has displayed in Costa Rica, along with its rejection of everything the government says, its attempts to modify the agenda we had agreed upon in Mexico, its efforts to introduce a series of documents, and its demand for immediate answers, it has initiated a strategy of murders here in El Salvador . everyone has noticed; they murdered a reporter's wife and son . Why? because they had a relative in the armed forces . They have murdered an innocent young girl, at a safe distance, in a cowardly manner, only because she was a relative of an armed forces member . yesterday they attempted to murder a former military man who also has a relative in the armed forces . What does all of this mean? that the Fmln intends to talk over there and to make an entire case out of its defending human rights, while murdering people and violating the human rights they claim to be defending, on a daily basis . all of these Fmln attitudes force us to dialogue, and as I said at the beginning, I must be completely clear and open . I must tell the Salvadoran people the truth . I believe that so far the Fmln has not displayed the political resolve to achieve peace . First of all, the Fmln does not want to talk about ending the conflict, it does not want to give the entire country--you and I, my dear viewers--the opportunity to stop living in this Whirlpool of violence, to live in peace, and to allow the process to progress in the search for solutions that will gradually give us firm and lasting peace, within an atmosphere of tranquility . The Fmln's attitude is one of provocation . It wants to provoke the government into getting up from the dialogue table; it has tried to anger the members of the Commission by insulting them . all in all, the Fmln is trying to force the government to desist . Why are they seeking this? because all they want is a little more image, the image that they have completely lost because their spaces have been closed . No one in the world will continue to justify an armed struggle . that is a thing of the past."
589,DEV-MUC3-0590,NO CITY ,1989-10-20,"President Arias was right when he said that perhaps Fidel Castro is the only one who insists on the situation--and who seems to have not yet returned from the Sierra Maestra where he was in 1959 . that seems to be the attitude of the Fmln leaders . What else do the armed forces, I mean, does the Fmln want with all these absurd proposals and attitudes? it is seeking to divide the armed forces . It is seeking to isolate the government of the Republic . It wants to the government image, which has been Consolidated little by little at the International level, because we are showing to the world that there is a democracy here, that a democratic process is being Consolidated, and that the forces that already exist within the democratic system are forces that truly want and seek peace, rather than forces that assassinate and cause destruction . Therefore, we can no longer think at this moment, that the Fmln has only viewed the dialogue from a strategic point of view . However, we want to say something . all this strategy should not confuse the Salvadoran people . We must be calm because the government of the Republic will not give an inch and will continue, through rational means, to struggle and search for peace, to which you and all Salvadorans are entitled . We are not going to fall into the traps the Fmln is trying to put before us . However, at this moment, what we should see is who wants peace and who does not want to search for peace . up to this moment, the Fmln has given no evidence it wants to attain peace and tranquility for you, the Salvadoran people . Nevertheless, we must not be pessimistic . Although it is true that one cannot say, for propaganda purposes, that outstanding results were obtained at the meeting in San Jose, Costa Rica, some results were attained . The dialogue process will continue and that should eliminate all traces of pessimism . We must think that the dialogue process that began in Mexico was not broken in San Jose, Costa Rica, and that this process will continue next month in Caracas, Venezuela . The issue again will be ceasing hostilities . We are becoming more and more aware of the various positions, and there is less room to play strategic games with the dialogue process . The Salvadoran government is willing to discuss any subject in this dialogue process . However, we must do this in an orderly manner . When we reach an agreement, such agreements must be respected . that is the attitude that should prevail if there is a true political desire to achieve peace . Therefore, once again I want to conclude my message by making an appeal for unity . We must be United for peace . all sectors--political, labor, religious, and business--must demand that the Fmln show a true desire to achieve peace . We must demand that the Fmln stop trying to use peace in El Salvador for strategic purposes . If the Fmln truly wants peace, why does it continue to smuggle weapons--probably from Nicaragua--into El Salvador . today, a truck from Nicaragua loaded with weapons and explosives for the Fmln was confiscated at the border with Honduras . This shows that the Fmln is not yet seriously searching for peace in El Salvador . However, the unity of the Salvadoran people should force the Fmln to search for peace . The unity of the Salvadoran people should close political space so the will stop its strategic games . all of us, United, should demand that the Fmln take the dialogue process seriously, equally as seriously as the Salvadoran government . We firmly believe we must search through peaceful means to have peace and calm in El Salvador . Salvadoran Brothers, let us not dismay . We have always said that we should not have excessive enthusiasm . This is not an easy problem, there will be obstacles, it is a difficult problem . However, we have always said you can be sure that your government is working for peace and will not cease to work for peace . May God bless you . good evening."
590,DEV-MUC3-0591,SAN SALVADOR,1989-10-20,"This has really been an agreement that reflects the government's interests, as well as the interests of the terrorist front . In this respect, we agree with the text of the San Jose accord . at a news conference held yesterday at the und, the Nationalist Democratic Union, it was said that the participation of two U.S. advisers and one U.S. military adviser prevented greater progress in the dialogue . How do you feel about that? we must never forget that terrorists try to confuse and try to foster an attitude and actions in the people solely to justify themselves . At no time was the military delegation, which participated as advisers in the dialogue, able to influence the decisions of the dialogue Commission . their role as advisers enabled them to give advice to the dialogue Commission, but it is absurd to think that the presence of our two military advisers and other advisers prevented real and complex positions from being taken at that meeting . There is no U.S. adviser...Moreover, we cannot .... no U.S. adviser accompanied our delegation . If there was one, he went strictly on his own . your question, therefore, is important, because it allows us to tell you that the Salvadoran military delegation never hampered the work of the government delegation during the talks . The Nongovernment human rights Commission presented the relatives of tortured and captured persons . It accused 1ST infantry Brigade commander Francisco Elena Fuentes and other officers of having ties to the death squads . I have been dealing with these kinds of reports over the past few days . friends--and here I am appealing to my friends--let us not allow the terrorists' desperate actions to confuse and convey a false message to the people . The fact is that this is part of the strategy of deceit, lies, and disrespect for the people and the country's democratic institutions implemented by the terrorists . Let me repeat that this is part of the above-mentioned strategy . We must not be deceived . We know full well who the persons are who are trying to sow mistrust and confusion among civilians . We are a responsible, serious, and formal institution . It is up to us to investigate all these violent incidents and deaths . We will do our duty by conducting an investigation."

After three days of substantive talks in Madrid, the two countries agreed``to lift all remaining restrictions""on trade and financial exchanges, said a joint communique issued here today . They also expressed a wish to normalize their ties``with a view to resuming diplomatic relations ,""it said . The discussions were held between British negotiator Crispin Tickell, Britain's ambassador to the United Nations, and veteran Argentine diplomat Lucio Garcia de solar . The talks, arranged after the two special envoys met in New York in August, were extended a day beyond its two-day schedule . They agreed to hold further negotiations to strive for the resumption of the two countries' diplomatic relations broken during the 1982 Malvinas war . the next substantive meeting will be held on February 14-15 , 1990 . During the Madrid talks, the two countries put aside the controversial issue of sovereignty over the South Atlantic Islands, which blocked their first reconciliation attempt in Bern, Switzerland, in 1984 . The communique said that the talks allowed both sides to hold their respective positions on the issue of sovereignty over the Islands and that nothing of their agreement could be interpreted as a change in their positions . As regards Fisheries, the communique said, both delegations had different positions but agreed``to set up a working group with a view to making proposals""to be submitted to further discussions . Argentina hopes for the lifting of the 150-Mile exclusive zone around the Malvinas Islands imposed by Britain after the 10-week war, which killed more than 1,000 people . A British trade mission will visit Argentina from November 27 to December 1, this year, and a new cultural agreement could be expected as Normalization advanced further, according to the document . links and contacts between the Falklands and the Continental mainland would be developed as beneficial . Britain also agreed to help Argentina establish its cooperative links with the European Community, which has rejected commercial ties with the Latin American country because of its Unnormalized relations with Britain . Britain is one of the 12 members of the European Community . describing the agreement as remarkable, Tickell, the British chief negotiator, said:``We have taken a very large step towards diplomatic relations...we are not there yet .""Argentine negotiator del solar expressed optimism for the resumption of full diplomatic ties and said:``My impression is that this will not be too long .""the Anglo-Argentine rapprochement was initiated by Argentina's president Carlos Menem, who took office in July . Menem said on the second day after his Inauguration that talks could be resumed on restoration of the two countries' diplomatic relations without discussing sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands . He voiced the hope that the diplomatic relations could resume by Christmas, a timetable that Britain said is extremely ambitious . However, observers here said the Madrid agreement has paved the way for Britain and Argentina to talk to each other without touching the thorny issue of sovereignty over the islands . by reaching the agreement, Britain and Argentina have taken a stride toward reconciliation, they said."

He said that the arsenal included a large quantity of explosives and high caliber weapons that were hidden in secret compartments of the Van, which was carrying furniture for a Salvadoran family . This demonstrates once more that the Nicaraguan government continues supporting the Fmln struggle and is directly supporting the urban Commandos, which are the Fmln death squads in this city . These manuals have been prepared in Nicaragua and bear the Fmln letterhead . They are intended for the urban Commandos and include tactical instructions as well as directions on how to use arms . In addition, Col Ponce showed a document that was seized at El Tigre Hill, Usulutan Department, on 30 July, dealing with military theory and urban war which, he said, the Fmln is carrying out in San Salvador . The document says the following in one of its paragraphs: the war against the authorities must be total and must reach their properties, families, homes, work places, and vacation retreats . We must always give priority to executions, but Harassment, psychological warfare, etc, are also part of this policy and may be carried out by the less experienced echelons to develop experience in using weapons . This shows that the claim that was made by the terrorist Ringleaders in Costa Rica is not valid . It is not true that they disagree with this line . According to Ponce's statements, the actions uncovered by military intelligence are totally at variance with the topics discussed at the negotiating tables in Mexico and Costa Rica, because they talk about reaching peace but their actions show the contrary."

602,DEV-MUC3-0603,BOGOTA,1989-10-24,"The possibilities for a dialogue with drug traffickers have increased in Colombia during the past few hours after the Extraditables announced they are willing to end the war . three of the leaders mentioned in the Extraditables' letter that contained a proposal to take part in a Commission that would reportedly begin making contacts for the dialogue today accepted the mission and said that they are ready to cooperate in the country's peace efforts . They are Medellin Mayor Juan Gomez Martinez, former liberal legislator Guido parra, and former conservative Minister Joaquin Vallejo . Meanwhile, Cardinal Mario Revollo said that``the matter must be studied .""the Extraditables proposed creating a negotiating Commission in a letter sent from Clandestinity to liberal Senator Luis Guillermo Giraldo, president of the National Congress . The possibility of a dialogue is under consideration by some political groups, despite the position assumed by the government of liberal President Virgilio Barco, who has repeatedly stated his opposition to any step leading to negotiations with drug traffickers and drug terrorists . Barco, through government Minister Carlos Lemos, has publicly said that a dialogue with terrorism is impossible, at least in the near future . In view of the situation, some political sectors have speculated on the possibility of negotiations between Barco's successor, who will be elected in free elections in May 1990 . Barco will leave power on 7 August 1990 . The mafia has promised to end the wave of terrorism unleashed several weeks ago if Barco's government SUSPENDS the Extradition of drug traffickers to the United States . They have also proposed accepting the decision of the Supreme Court of justice, which recognized the legality of the measures adopted to face the Mafias, but did not recommend Extradition by executive decree . The court ruled that international law prevails over Colombian law, and noted that Extradition through a state of siege decree is not compatible with the current Colombian-U.S. treaty . Colombia and the United States signed an Extradition treaty in 1979 which, although it is still in effect, cannot be applied because at the end of 1987 the Supreme Court itself invalidated the law that enforced it . However, several Colombian Jurists said today that only the Colombian foreign Ministry can determine whether to accept the court's decision or to continue acting by executive decree . in their peace proposal, the Extraditables demanded that the government``grant COLOMBIANS their legitimate right to defense, allowing them--as Deported foreigners are allowed--to exhaust all legal means under administrative law before renouncing sovereignty and turning them over by Extradition .""Vallejo, parra, and Gomez Martinez--the three members proposed by the mafia to participate in the negotiating Commission--said today that they are willing to work in favor of peace in the country . They agreed that differences can only be eased through dialogue .``I am willing to talk ,""said Gomez Martinez, Mayor of Medellin, where the Medellin cartel operates . over a year ago, Gomez Martinez was the target of an attack by the the Extraditables, who tried to Kidnap him .``I am waiting for the government's Okey to begin the dialogue ,""he added . Vallejo, who disclosed that in Mid-1988 he presented to Barco's government an initial dialogue proposal from the Extraditables, said that``I am willing to talk in order to achieve peace .""parra, a former parliamentarian and friend of Pablo Escobar, the Medellin cartel's chief, said that``I am willing to contribute to the peace efforts .""other sectors, particularly political groups, agreed that negotiation is the only way to put an end to terrorist violence in Colombia."
603,DEV-MUC3-0604,BOGOTA,1989-10-24,"The government said today that it will continue to Extradite Colombian citizens sought by the United States . The government will use administrative channels because there is currently no Extradition treaty with that country . in a communique issued by the national security Council, the executive branch also denied any possibility of participating in a dialogue with drug traffickers . The national security Council's communique States that the government policy is to struggle against Drug-Trafficking groups and their criminal organizations . The communique adds that the policy allows no room for transactions, negotiations, or dialogues . Therefore, the government REJECTS any proposal to Mediate with drug traffickers--even if the proposal is directly issued by the Extraditables or their spokesmen . The communique States that the government has announced that it will continue to enforce legislative decree 18-60 of 1989, which allows for Extraditions through administrative channels . This decree was unanimously approved by the Supreme Court of justice . The national security Council justifies its decision by recalling the many acts of terrorism perpetrated by drug traffickers--222 in 2 months--and the names of the victims . The communique says that the drug traffickers are now trying to disguise their criminal positions by claiming that they advocate peace . The discussions about the enforcement or suspension of Colombian citizens' Extradition was the main topic discussed today in juridical and political circles in our country and in the United States . journalists and lawyers carefully read the Supreme Court of Justice's ruling on the decree allowing for Extraditions through administrative channels . Everyone wanted to know why the Extraditables said, in a letter issued yesterday, that they fully abided by the court's ruling . The court ruled that, although the Extraditions via administrative channels are allowed by the Constitution in cases where there is already an international treaty, the Extradition must be carried out according to the treaty . The court believes that the ruling is quite clear . The government must decide if there is a treaty with the United States or not before it enforces the Extradition through administrative channels . Nevertheless, the court's ruling does not end the Extraditions to the United States because, even though the court believes that an Extradition treaty is still in effect with that country--the one signed in 1888--and that it should be enforced instead of resorting to Extraditions through administrative channels, the government clearly says there is no Extradition treaty with the United States . The 1979 treaty had been Annulled by the Supreme Court of justice, but according to the state Council, that treaty replaced--so to speak--the 1933 treaty signed in Montevideo and the 1888 treaty . Therefore, things are now the same as yesterday or the day before . Meanwhile, the bodyguard of El Espectador's chief of distribution in Medellin, Pedro Luis Osorio, was assassinated this afternoon in a downtown area of Antioquia's capital."

According to the police, unidentified persons drove up to the Soviet Embassy building and planted a bomb under a car belonging to one of our diplomatic personnel . They hardly had time to drive off before an explosion rang out . One car was totally destroyed and three neighboring vehicles were damaged . This happened at 2015 local time . and at 2030 hours a Volkswagen parked near the entrance of the Prc Embassy exploded after being packed with dynamite . Fortunately, there are no casualties and no members of the diplomatic missions are hurt .

It is in effect in 35 percent of the country's territory, particularly in Lima and the capitals of a number of departments . However, the wave of terrorism is showing no sign of abating--either on the part of the far right or the far left . in October alone, their actions claimed 200 lives .``Sendero Luminoso""is trying to intimidate the population and wreck the municipal elections planned for 12 November . They have partially achieved their aim . to the uninformed, Peruvian statistics are simply horrifying: in the last 3 years , 64 mayors of various small and medium-sized towns in the andes have been killed . Naturally, there are few brave enough to take the risk of holding this post . What kind of conditions are Soviet representatives in Peru living and working in? so far there have been no restrictions on our freedom of movement .

628,DEV-MUC3-0629,MANAGUA ,1989-11-01,"Mr President, regarding point no . 6 in which you spoke about specific results concerning the demobilization of the Contras, to what specific amounts is the Nicaraguan government referring to? are you saying that 20 percent , 10 percent or 50 percent of the Contras have to be Demobilized in order for the cease-fire to be implemented again? the important point is to begin implementing the plan . Then, the number of Contras that are Demobilized would be established according to the decisions made at the United Nations . that is, how many Contras can be Demobilized right away, how many of them will be returning to Nicaragua, how many will go to third countries . Therefore, to the extent the plan is being implemented, we will be willing to reinstate the cease-fire . Mr President, up until last week, the U.S. Congress discussed giving more aid to the Contras . No one even wanted to talk about the Contras, it was a stale issue . However, it has become a burning issue overnight and everybody is now talking about aid for the Contras and even the possibility of giving military aid to them . last night, the U.S. Senate issued a resolution strongly Condenming the Nicaraguan government . My questions are: first, why has there been such a sudden and unexpected change . Second, what is your message to the U.S. Congress . U.S . Congressmen are only concerned about their reelection . with the due respect that some of them deserve, U.S . Congressmen are only worried about their reelection . I have talked to many of them here and they are cynical . They tell me: I disagree with that but I have to think about those who elected me . If those who elected me have a different opinion, then I have to express support for their viewpoints and forget about my own opinion . Let us not mislead ourselves . You know very well how U.S . Congressmen act . Therefore, it was easier for them to simply approve funds for the Contras as they had done--because the Congress had approved the so-called humanitarian aid for the Contras and let the war continue, and leave the burden on the central American governments, especially on the Nicaraguan government and people who are suffering the effects of this war . Therefore, we have been reporting the killings, the assassinations, the crimes, the Contras attacks, and the Yankee Congress has remained silent . Therefore, we see an easy-going attitude in the U.S. Congress . Obviously, when we announce we are not going to extend the cease-fire the U.S. Congress reacts immediately . They react because they are fully aware that they are meddling in Nicaraguan politics . They will have to resume discussions on the Nicaraguan issue, and they do not want to discuss the Nicaraguan issue again . It was easy to set aside the Nicaraguan issue and to simply approve funds for the Contras so the Contras could continue killing Nicaraguans while everything else remains calm--let the peace plan continue as far as it can and as far as President Bush allows it to develop . The U.S . Congressmen can then forget about the Nicaraguan issue and work on other domestic or international issues in which they are more interested . However, when Nicaragua says: We will not extend the cease-fire, then they raise an outcry . Why do they raise an outcry? because they know they will have to resume discussions on the Nicaraguan issue . Moreover, there might be a feverish Congressman who will propose giving military aid to the Contras . Well, let them discuss military aid . do they want to discuss military aid, well that is their problem . We simply believe that the way the Yankee Congress actions will ease or hinder the electoral process . the development of elections on 25 February will depend now on the Yankee Congress and on the Yankee President . It will depend on them . We have the desire to do it . However, whether or not the elections are held on 25 February will depend on them."

However, it is regrettable that Fenastras leaders have been hindering the investigations that could clear up the attack . Nonetheless, the government REITERATES its determination to carry out a thorough investigation, and will even bring to the country some experts in this field so that with the help of modern science and technology they will help the investigative committee clarify this bloody and criminal attack and establish who is responsible . Likewise, the government has decided to appoint a Commission that will guarantee the investigations, and it will invite the following: one representative from the United Nations; one representative from the OAS; one representative from the Salvadoran bishops' conference; one representative from the political parties; two labor union representatives, one of them being from Fenastras; Dr Ignacio Ellacuria; the Attorney General of the Republic; and the Minister of justice . 2 . The government of the Republic has supplied evidence from the beginning that it is sincerely seeking peace . The dialogue Commission attended a first meeting with the Fmln in Mexico, and accepted a commitment, as follows, and I quote: both parties commit themselves not to withdraw unilaterally from the dialogue . The Fmln's withdrawal from the dialogue is not only a violation of the Mexico agreement, but also the Salvadoran people's hopes for peace . far from suspending the dialogue, the Fmln should understand that the search for peace is now more necessary than ever in order to halt the bloodshed . 3 . evidently, in situations like this one, the enemies of peace are trying to make the dialogue fail . The recent terrorist actions are an insult to the civilized mechanisms that have come up at the negotiations table .

639,DEV-MUC3-0640,CLANDESTINE,1989-11-04,"Commander Leonel Gonzalez, on Friday night Mr Alfredo Cristiani announced some measures which the government will adopt in connection with Fenastras and the dialogue . The Fmln announced it had suspended its trip to Caracas, but Cristiani said that the government Commission will go to Caracas regardless of our decision . What is your opinion on the government's decision? in my opinion, two positions on the dialogue and the negotiations process were made evident in San Jose . The government of Alfredo Cristiani and the armed forces high command view the dialogue as an opportunity for talking, buying time, and building a good image for themselves . on the other hand, the Fmln is working for a real negotiations process . The Fmln has opened a broader debate, a debate that includes discussions with and the participation of political parties, the social forces, the church, all the sectors . We have initiated a national dialogue . As we see it, the goal is part of a whole, it is not everything . the entire process of allowing the participation of the social forces is important also . In recent days we have seen actions unprecedented in the history of El Salvador . There was the attack on workers in which 10 workers died and 31 were injured . The Fmln cannot ignore this fact . This is part of the process . We have said that we are going to establish contact with observers and Mediators to analyze the situation, and we will discuss this process with the political parties and the social forces . What we want is to consolidate the negotiations process . We are not trying to enhance our image; our people know who is telling the truth . In San Jose we made a solution proposal that envisages democracy, human rights, and a process to find a way out of the Salvadoran conflict . on Monday and Wednesday of next week we are going to meet in Washington with OAS and UN representatives . also on Monday in San Jose, Costa Rica, we could be in contact with the Costa Rican government to analyze the situation . We will analyze developments to determine the position of the Cristiani government . If actions by the Cristiani government close the possibilities of Caracas, then we will adopt measures . What we have done is to announce a suspension to create conditions for making progress toward real negotiations, as the San Jose agreements establish . Then why is the government going to Caracas, commander? I believe that the announcement on the government delegation going to Caracas is aimed at enhancing the government's image, at creating a smoke screen around the massacre committed against the popular movement . Now that you mention the Fenastras massacre, what do you think about the creation of a Commission to investigate this case that Cristiani has announced? one of the points of our San Jose proposal calls for changing the Salvadoran legal system because it is vitiated and is in the hands of one single party . So, in this framework, conducting an investigation is like putting the case inside a forgotten drawer . This is what happened to the Monsignor Romero case, the case of the revolutionary Democratic front leaders, and the cases of thousands of workers who have been murdered and whose cases have been forgotten . The purpose of this Commission is to create a smoke screen around the grave human rights violations being committed by the Cristiani government . We believe that the persons who have been invited to form part of this Commission should not lend themselves to playing a part in the effort to hide what is really behind all this . what the Cristiani government wants is to divert away from Emilio Ponce all the accusations and charges, and Ponce is the one who is directly involved in this kind of attack .

He said that he has no evidence that those groups are responsible for the explosions in the Salvadoran workers National Union Federation and Comadres [committee of mothers and relatives of the past, the Army has been blamed, and later it has been discovered that Fmln terrorists had carried them out . Elena Fuentes recalled that a few days ago there was an explosion on the National University campus and he went there and it was established in front of student leaders that the explosion was caused by a grenade that went off in the hands of a young leftist who was handling it . by then, however, statements had already been made accusing the military . Elena Fuentes also referred to internal purges within Communist groups, purges like the case of Melida Anaya Montes, alias commander Maria; Salvador Cayetano Carpio, alias Marcial; and others . He said:``it would not be strange to find that these actions have been the result of a purge or a diversionary tactic by the Communists to attract political attention and gain the people's support, which everybody believes they are losing .""it was recalled, with all due respect, that the name of one of the victims of the Fenastras attack, Febe Elizabeth Velasquez, was mentioned in the investigations being carried out by international organizations over the embezzlement of aid from European countries that was to benefit the most needy people in our country, but that ended up in the hands of terrorist groups to be used for terrorist purposes . Elena Fuentes stated:``time and investigations will tell what really happened .""he said that the purpose of these attacks, especially the one on the defense Ministry, for which the Fmln - FDR claimed credit, as well as the attacks on Comadres and Fenastras, was to give the Fmln - FDR leadership justification to withdraw from the dialogue .

642,DEV-MUC3-0643,MOSCOW ,1989-10-05,"The us House of Representatives has approved by a majority vote an Anti-Nicaraguan resolution which grants $4 million worth of so-called humanitarian aid for the Contras . analyst Marina Petrovskaya discusses the subject . This resolution in essence allows the continuation of the dirty war against Nicaragua . The Somosa forces have lately increased their terrorist actions in several parts of Nicaragua by killing civilians and Sandinist soldiers . As witnessed by the, this has not happened by chance . Many Contras turned themselves into the Nicaraguan authorities when and amnesty was declared . They admitted that they received orders from their leaders in Honduras to cross the border and, by means of terror and threat, forced civilians to vote for the opposition candidates . Suprisingly, the Somosa forces have not aimed at more ambitious goals . Instead of being condemned by Washington they are receiving complementary aid from it . curiously, this new for the Contras coincides with the granting of $9 million to finance the electoral campaign of the Nicaraguan opposition, just when Mrs Violeta de Chamorro has received $3 million for herself . Such us government aid for the Nicaraguan rightist sectors alarms the Nicaraguan and the International communities . elections will be held in Nicaragua in a few months following the National democratization process which is being conducted in keeping with the commitments assumed by the Nicaraguan government, according to intelligence reports from Guatemala and Honduras . This democratization process cannot be normal since confrontations between Contras and are increasing, and these are the responsibility of the United States . As is known, the Sandinist authorities have been forced to suspend the cessation of military operation against the Somosa forces, which had been in effect since May 1988 . Meanwhile, Washington has accused the Sandinists of violating democracy and of hindering a political solution . such an evaluation of the Sandinist action is unjust in order to achieve peace and security in the region, including Nicaragua, it is necessary that all the parties involved in the conflict make an effort, not just one . look at the situation in El Salvador these days . It looked like the conditions for a cease-fire had improved and this is why we applauded the negotiations between the government . But the progress made was rejected by the rightist groups which refused to hold constructive negotiations . This is why the Fmln refuses to hold the third round of negotiations until the government officials change their old methods of solving internal problems without guaranteeing the security of the leftist forces . It seems to me that the events taking place in Nicaragua and El Salvador are similar because the peace efforts in the two countries are being obstructed by military forces financed by the U.S. government, which continues to keep a heated environment in those countries and to look for solutions from a position of force."

645,DEV-MUC3-0646,MOSCOW ,,"The country is experiencing one of the worst Anticommunist and terrorist campaigns in a long time . This campaign is similar to the one unleashed between 1964 and 1970 . The situation is further aggravated because it is taking place under a dictatorship that will stop at nothing to achieve its objectives . During his speech in Coihaique, Pinochet threatened to end the state of law . This has been followed by other threats by [deputy opponents, and by equally threatening statements and systematic aggression against Army members who criticize the dictatorial regime . Meanwhile El Mercurio and the Progovernment news media have orchestrated a campaign that is financed by Buchi's electoral managers . This campaign uses editorials, attributed articles, and paid ads that are aimed at Misinforming and manipulating public opinion . The objective is to create a mood of aggression toward the left and toward the Communist party, a mood that would justify any kind of provocation . The worst example was a recent paid ad published by Buchi's electoral managers on an alleged threat of Communist strike squads that were going to gun down the Progovernment candidate . It is well known that this statement, reportedly made by a young Christian Democratic party leader to La Segunda on 31 October, was later flatly denied by the Christian Democratic leader himself . Despite this denial, Buchi's campaign managers are still harping on the subject, trying to create an atmosphere of violence and unease . The brutal murder of Jecar Neghme, unsolved like so many others, has been followed by other serious events including the kidnapping of the driver of Volodia Teitelboim, the Secretary General of the Communist party . This was a threat to comrade Volodia Teitelboim's safety and physical integrity . There has also been Harassment of leaders and candidates of the Communist party and other Democratic parties, an increase in the number of arbitrary arrests of opponents in general, the establishment of a new joint command headed by the defense Minister . The alleged objective of this command is to fight crime, but the people have rightly guessed that it is a cover for political repression similar to that conducted by a prior organization that bore the same name . In this Anticommunist and Antidemocratic atmosphere, meetings have been held with officers and relatives of military men . During these meetings the audience is Misinformed, threatened, and urged to oppose Democratic changes . They are also urged to hoard staples and to take special measures to provide for extreme contingencies . There is yet another especially serious development about which we want to inform the people . We have received information from various sources to the effect that the crowning point of this Anticommunist campaign will be an attack on a High-Ranking Army officer who has been criticized for his involvement in human-rights violations . The charges against this officer made by Communist party candidates for senators, and the demonstrations held against him by the relatives of the victims, will be used to blame the Communists for this attack . We want to reiterate our absolute rejection of human rights violations and our demand for truth and justice . However, we also want to make it clear that we are struggling to have every crime and every violation investigated and the culprits tried . The atmosphere of fear and psychological warfare is aimed at twisting the popular will of the Chilean people and destabilizing in advance the next Democratic administration . We call upon the citizenry to be prepared to display unity and Democratic organization so as to guarantee the normal development of the ongoing electoral process and to be on guard against any provocation aimed at creating a climate favorable to an interruption of the process . We must deploy our forces if we are to ensure the victory of freedom and democracy in a landslide victory for Patricio Aylwin on 14 December and the election of a Congress capable of guaranteeing progress toward the government system that most Chileans want . signed: Chilean Communist party dated: Santiago , 2 November 1989"
646,DEV-MUC3-0647,CLANDESTINE,1989-11-07,"From this standpoint, the proposal brought by the Christiani government delegation to San Jose sought to gain time while keeping the image that the government was engaged in a dialogue . However, the government was not really seeking the path toward a negotiation . on the contrary, it sought to conduct under the shadow of the dialogue actions that will give it an advantage over the Fmln, including terrorist attacks like this one . The operation against the Fenastras leadership is part of the Cristiani government policy, and so is the wave of repression against the mass movement from the onset of this government . The proposal submitted in Costa Rica included mass groups as part of the enemy . all these things are part of the government policy . We cannot allow the government to hide this policy behind the dialogue, as this policy allows actions like the one at Fenastras to go unpunished and do not lead to a true solution of the conflict . that is why the Fmln suspended its participation in Caracas, but has not suspended its participation in the dialogue . In fact, the Fmln has undertaken bids to conduct a mediation so that the adequate conditions for a dialogue are created and actions like the one in Fenastras do not continue . deep down, we feel that in order for the dialogue to turn into a negotiation that will end the Salvadoran conflict...the progress of the mass movement in El Salvador with all the existing forms of struggle is what will compel the other side to really sit down at the negotiations table . so long as the other side feels that it can defeat the people, it will not be truly committed to negotiating an end to the conflict . When it sees that the people will defeat it, and that it is forced to negotiate, then a negotiation will truly take place in the country . commander Mario Lopez, the latest developments, even following the Fenastras attack, indicate that government policy does not seem to change regarding the human rights violations and threats to the mass movement . In fact, the Lutheran church, or rather its pastor Leardo Gomez, has received death threats . do you think an internal purge in the armed forces is possible? do you think that with that internal purge it can be possible to stop the extreme human rights violations in the country? the Fmln has proposed an internal purge in the armed forces as an important factor in the process of dialogue or negotiations, meaning that the armed forces themselves must get rid of the corrupt and criminal elements . However, the crux of the matter is the need to purge the armed forces . The Fmln has told them: purge yourselves . However, that is practically impossible . on one side, the need to have a true purge in the armed forces becomes apparent, because otherwise we cannot make progress and have true democracy in our country . recent developments are proving the Fmln is right . on the other side, it is clear that the criminal elements control the military power and have influence over the country's political power . The presence of La Tandona in front of the television cameras, following the dialogue session in Costa Rica, was meant to tell the people: We rule and can do as we please . Then the attacks came . I feel that the need to end that situation is evident to all, as well as how right the Fmln stand is . I now want to reiterate that we cannot achieve that goal unless we force the armed forces and the government to carry out that purge . by forcing them, I mean that the people's force must tell them to do that if they want to survive . The demand that Colonel Rene Emilio Ponce leave, as he is one of the chief culprits of the above-mentioned policy, will grow stronger . The people must press and are pressing this demand."

He said that U.S. assistance will depend . What do you think about his visit to our country? it is basically aimed at saving Cristiani's prestige and image, as this has been a matter of great concern for the U.S. government from the beginning . They need a Potable image, an image that portrays legitimacy, and an image of moderation that will not isolate the government internationally . The Fenastras incident undoubtedly unmasked Cristiani's government . Therefore, Aronson's visit is aimed at saving Cristiani's image and supporting Cristiani's initiative of creating a Commission to investigate those incidents, in order to foster hopes and credibility among some groups regarding the government's interest in clarifying the incidents . that was Aronson's intention . as a matter of fact, Cristiani's image is important for the aid itself . aspects related to human rights play a very important role in the debates at the U.S. Congress, where the aid is approved . Therefore, that aid would be endangered if the debates on violations of human rights in El Salvador are intensified . It could have an effect on that . So what they are really trying to save is the aid to continue supporting the war . in that regard, we must also remember that within the doctrine of low intensity warfare, the political aspects of the Counterinsurgency plan play an important role that will not appear to be in the extreme right; a government that appears to be more in the center than in the extreme right, in order to create expectations within some groups regarding the government's credibility, and also at the International level . While trying to defeat the rebels militarily and through repression, it is necessary to maintain an acceptable image of the government . You are a member of the Fmln's Political-Diplomatic Commission . as a result of the Fenastras incidents, our front cancelled its attendance at the Caracas meeting . What are the possibilities for restoring the talks and continuing the dialogue - negotiation with the government? the Fmln is interested in a real dialogue, a dialogue that will lead to a negotiated solution of the conflict; in other words, a dialogue that will lead to negotiations . We differ with Cristiani's government on this . from the beginning, arena has expressed its willingness to participate in a dialogue, but not to negotiate . They have a totally different concept."

It is directly in line with what I have said; that is, that the IMF's prescriptions cannot be accepted and applied to this country, for instance, because the people will not put up with measures like those which have been proposed by the IMF and endorsed by Honduran private enterprise . What about Flores' statements saying that relations with the United States will be different in his government? I do not know . The relations with my government have been relations of total unity .

What happens is that, in the case of aid, if there is a delay in payments of over 1 year on any program, the disbursements of all programs are stopped . There was a payment corresponding to military aid, or military commitments, that had not been made .

In view of this escalation of violence, the government on 7 November decreed a state of emergency in the 10 provinces of the Department of Lima, placing them under military control . This is the Peruvian Department with the largest population and with the largest number of voters . It has more than 6,000,000 people, and includes the port of callao .

657,DEV-MUC3-0658,BUENOS AIRES,1989-11-09,"The motor transport workers Union began an indefinite strike at midnight, Contradicting government orders which stated that the Uta and the Argentine Federation of automotive passenger carriers must solve the salary problem through negotiations . The situation on the third day of the stoppage is slightly better, although a large number of people are still waiting on the streets trying to get on the few buses being driven by their owners . a few minutes ago, deputy Secretary for transportation Nestor Fernandez announced that at midday only 30 percent of the usual number of buses in the Federal capital were working normally; because of this, measures will be adopted to ensure that at least 50 percent of the buses will run today . representatives of the Federal police, the Buenos Aires provincial police, and the National Gendermerie are meeting at transportation Secretariat offices to study ways of restoring normal bus service . subway chairman Jose Barbero reports that his sector's services have also improved, and five subway lines are functioning normally . Although the subway personnel are members of the Uta, they have decided to suspend their strike . The railroad service is normal . more coaches will be put into service, and the number of trains in service will be increased, but trains of the Roca line connecting Constitucion to La Plata through the Temperley stretch are delayed because of a Derailment . Uta Secretary General Juan Manuel Palacios has confirmed that the indefinite strike will continue and that the Uta will not accept compulsory negotiations because this is not a legal solution to the conflict . He says that this would merely put off the problem for a month or so . Palacios added that it would only create more difficulties for the workers . Fatap director Luis Carral asserted that the business sector will double its efforts to put the buses back into service . Carral said that in view of compulsory negotiations Fatap will urge workers to return to their jobs unless they want to be dismissed . Transportation sector businessmen have informed the transportation Secretariat that a few drivers are returning to work . businessmen believe that in a few more hours 40-50 percent of the buses will be functioning normally . President Carlos Menem commented this morning on the Uta attitude: This is an emergency situation . We cannot pay more than we have . I believe that the businessmen have offered a basic salary of around 75,000 Australes per month . until yesterday this amount represented nearly $100, and this is a good increase . evidently, there is a political infiltration of ideas that are not shared by all Argentine people . I do not believe the infiltration comes from Peronist or radical movements . This is the work of the Ultra-Left . Menem asserted that those who want to work and who are sacrificing themselves for the benefit of the people will be rewarded . He urged them not to leave their posts . Menem added that yesterday many members of the public asked him not to give in . The President said he has decided not give in, not because he is stubborn, but because people who need the public transport services cannot be defrauded . Asked if the railroads that join the strike will be closed down, Menem said: the railroad lines that strike will be closed . But many people will be left without transportation . We will find a way of getting these people to their jobs . We cannot accept this type of attitude . or would you prefer to see the country explode? at 1700 this afternoon the cabinet meeting that started last night will be reconvened . The cabinet members attending the meeting will analyze the difficulties created by the Uta decision to continue the strike . The meeting will be held at the room under the chairmanship of interior Minister Eduardo Bauza . Justicialist leader Antonio Caffiero will attend the meeting . Pres Menem will not attend . It has been reported that 50 bus companies have been urged to return to normal work; otherwise decree 429, which provides for the temporary Confiscation of buses, will be implemented . This decree, which has been mentioned by President Menem, establishes that buses will be confiscated and driven by National Gendarmerie personnel . in a Justicialist party communique signed by Antonio Caffiero, the party expresses its support for the decisions made by President Menem . commander Adalino Barberi, the National Gendarmerie director general, has reported that the transportation Secretariat officials are still studying the measures to be taken to Confiscate the buses from the owners who fail to follow government instructions."

It also made an appeal so that no accusations lacking scientific support are made in order not to generate speculations that Politicize this case . in an official communique, the government made the preceding statement because of the``Biased propagandistic campaign being developed by the Fmln and other political and labor union organizations, seeking to create a distorted view of the recent terrorist attacks in the country .""the communique recalls that on the same day of the terrorist attack against Fenastras, the government condemned such criminal action .

The government has decided to create a Commission that will be composed of representatives from the United Nations, the OAS, Cedes, political parties, labor union organizations--including one from Fenastras--Dr Ignacio Ellacuria, the prosecuting attorney's office, and the justice Minister . However, Fenastras leaders have continued hindering the investigation at the site of the incident, the communique adds . The government communique States that the Fenastras refusal to participate in the Commission could be interpreted as``an intentional plan by Fenastras leaders to prevent the investigation to determine who is responsible for this terrorist attack .""therefore, the government communique requests the abandonment of such an attitude . The government, the communique adds, believes that the investigation is legal and that Fenastras has the moral duty to help in the investigation to clarify this case . The government of President Cristiani reiterated its appeal to citizens to abstain from making accusations lacking scientific evidence, in order to prevent speculation that hampers the normal development of the judicial process that has already begun . The government reiterated that``its true objective is to clarify this barbaric action and to punish those responsible, no matter who they are .""`` We request all citizens to abstain from issuing speculative opinions, and, should they have something to report that would help clarify this regrettable incident, they should do it within the judicial process ,""the official government communique States .

661,DEV-MUC3-0662,CLANDESTINE,1989-11-09,"What does this tell us? What message does this convey? it tells us that these organizations, the so-called support organizations--the Coprefa calls them fronts--are components of the enemy side in the war . When they sit down to talk to the main representatives of the enemy, the Fmln, and when they negotiate issues like the end to hostilities, the government immediately make demands and all these political, ideological, psychological, etcetera, etcetera, actions stop . The message this conveys is that as far as the government is concerned, all those organizations are part of the enemy side in the war . What happened later was the creation of many such fronts . The repression has been going on for quite some time and had increased . However, the government had never presented an idea like this one . Once it did, everything became very clear . all the past actions are part of the government's and the Army's war actions against all these expressions and demonstrations by the Salvadoran people . The Fenastras massacre was part of this plan . The killing of 3 members of the Mpsc in Sonsonate carried out by the 6th military detachment in front of witnesses--they left messages on the bodies stating that they were traitors to the homeland--was carried out with the clear intention of sending another message . The message is: not only in theory do we consider you components of the enemy side . You are the enemy and that is why we are killing you . regarding the visit to El Salvador of Bernard Aronson, assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American affairs, commander Jorge Shafik Handal said: the heads of the armed forces and military units who carried out these crimes remain in office . those who gave the orders remain in office . Then how can an investigation be carried out? a chain of command must be followed in the military . If a subordinate is going to be Interrogated, one must first ask permission from his superior, and they are the superiors . Besides, no one knows who the subordinates who participated are . that information must come from the Army . that is why we have said that the least they can do before they begin investigating this incident is remove Colonel Rene Emilio Ponce . that would be the right thing to do . I would even add that there are a few others who should be removed . If we were living in a country with a Democratic political system and with labor unions, that would be common practice . It would not even be necessary to bring this up at a public debate . The first thing the President should have done as Commander in chief of the armed forces--he is involved in these crimes because he is commander in chief of the armed forces--is remove them and not say that he was not consulted on this matter . He claims he knew nothing about this, but we have our own sources of information and we know that he knew . But if he wants us to believe him when he says that he did not know, then the first thing he should do is what any man with any self-respect would do: ask for an investigation . However, he is hindering the investigation, which is what is always done when something like this happens . When things like this happen, a few--those who want to see matters clarified--resign, while others are removed."

How can they know who the bombs, rockets, or shots will hit? it is a truly dangerous situation . I urge the international community--just as it becomes concerned, carries out campaigns, and makes statements when the Nicaraguan government ADOPTS harsh measures--when these events are taking place in El Salvador to draw attention to the situation . The international community must speak out and prevent the bombing of Salvadoran people and cities .

No one must be mistaken about this . .

At 2000 on 11 November, the Fmln launched the military - political plan drafted by the general command consisting of a national military maneuver called:``out with the fascists! Febe Elizabeth lives!""the plan began with an attack from at least 50 directions on the enemy positions in the city of San Salvador . Since that time, our units have been waging fierce combat with the enemy forces, occupying positions in various parts of the city that we are still holding . other groups later joined the maneuver and attacked in the cities of San Miguel, Zacatecoluca, Usulutan, Santa Ana, Chalatenango, and the Comalapa International Airport . There were also dozens of attacks against positions in towns and highways of the country . After 18 hours of combat, the following are the estimated results: over 400 casualties on the armed forces, including killed and wounded; 12 armored vehicles have been destroyed; 3 helicopters and 1 or 2 small small airplanes were destroyed on the ground; and 2 helicopters were downed; tens of thousands of cartridges, over 50 rifles, Machineguns, and other types of weapons have been recovered . These results greatly exceed the expectations of this maneuver due to the impact and effectiveness of the fighting . Our fighters have fulfilled this part of the plan in a daring, courageous, and effective manner, proving their high combat morale . Now they must hold the positions they have taken, thus guaranteeing that the goals of the plan are achieved . We denounce the indiscriminate bombing by the Salvadoran Air force . We call on the people to protect themselves from the bombing . to do this, the people are counting on support and guidance from our fighters . We also call on the country's civilian population to join those who have already joined the combat or are helping our forces . We call on the soldiers and officers forced to fight against their own people to suspend the bombing, to refuse to carry out a Genocidal action, and to desert and join our forces . We urge International humanitarian organizations and relief groups to help protect civilians who are being harassed by the Army or who are in any other emergency situation . out with the fascists!

699,DEV-MUC3-0700,SAN SALVADOR,1989-10-13,"Colonel Francisco Elena Fuentes, commander of the 1ST infantry Brigade, today refuted the charges raised by the nongovernmental human rights Commission that his Brigade has death squads and clandestine jails . The charge, which was raised on 13 October by the nongovernmental human rights Commission, links the 1ST infantry Brigade with the death squads . The Commission presented the testimony of Cesar Vielman Joya Martinez, a former soldier in the 1ST infantry Brigade, who described in a Video report filmed in Mexico how the clandestine structures in that military Garrison operate . According to Joya, these clandestine structures are directed by High-Ranking officers who Kidnap, murder and cause the Disapperance of labor union members . After denying all charges against him and his Garrison, Col Elena said that Joya indeed served in the 1ST infantry Brigade; that he deserted when he was placed under investigation for overriding his authority; and that it was proved later that on 5 July, at Tres Ceibas Canton, in Apopa, he murdered a peasant and tortured another one who died later at Rosales hospital . This man is a murderer, Deserter, and thief . immediately after we learned about the abuses of authority he committed at the 1ST Brigade, we placed him under investigation . He fled from the Garrison when he realized that the high command had ordered the investigation . I wish to state that there is no group of death squads as was stated in a certain newscast because we are professionals and do not have these kinds of forces, which we might call obscure . We act according to law . This is what I can tell you . I also wish to state that I have here in my hands a record that was built since the first day this individual committed the abuses of authority . He was taken to an operation in the Nejapa area where he captured eight people and murdered one . He then took them to the 1ST Brigade and one of them was severly beaten . The National Guard is in charge of investigating these murders and the case is at the 1ST peace court, according to Col Elena . The Deserter was recruited during February 1989, committed the murders on 5 July, and deserted from the 1ST Brigade in August . based on the Video report, he may be living in Mexico, from which--it was hinted--the former soldier's Extradition may be requested . Finally, Col Elena denied that any clandestine jails have ever existed in his military Garrison . He also denied that a Fenastras woman leader by the last name of Chan Chang is being held prisoner there."

We repeat, two soldiers were captured at 6th East street in San Miguel . one of the soldiers surrendered to the people because he was wounded .

Our Army respects the Geneva agreements . We continue our San Miguel reporting . At 1030 today, we destroyed a light tank on 6th North Avenue thereby increasing the number of light tanks that we have destroyed all over the country .

702,DEV-MUC3-0703,SAN SALVADOR,1989-11-12,"Good afternoon, Salvadoran people . On 19 March, our government was elected by the Salvadoran people, who demanded political stability, peaceful coexistence, as well as judicial and social security in our country . These irrational actions that the Fmln has unleashed in the last few days, and particularly as of yesterday, make it necessary for the government of the Republic to take action, to take firm action within the legal framework of our country . We must accept the people's mandate of 19 March, and the government must now respond with firm action, within the legal framework . We must respond because the Fmln is attacking the civilian population--more than anyone else--in a brutal and savage manner . The Armed forces of El Salvador are controlling the situation, and they have controlled the situation . However, these Fmln terrorists, who already feel they have been defeated by the armed forces, are now beginning to carry out indiscriminate acts of terrorism . They are even going as far as entering innocent homes to pressure families who are trying to live through these harsh times that all Salvadorans have experienced . that is why we must act firmly but within the law . to this effect, Salvadoran people, the Council of ministers met at 1400 in the Presidential house to try to solve something we are completely sure is what the Salvadoran people want . When we sat down to talk with the members of the cabinet, we recalled article 2 of our Constitution, which says: all persons have a right to life, physical and moral integrity, freedom, security, work, property, and the right to be protected and have their lives and possessions defended . that is why the Council of ministers this afternoon made a decision, based on the legal mechanisms granted to it by the Constitution . First, Salvadoran people, I will read article 29 of the Constitution, which reads as follows: article 29 . In cases of war, invasion of the territory, rebellion, sedition, catastrophe, epidemic, or other General calamity, or in cases of grave disruption of the public order, the guarantees Estalished in articles 5, article 6, subparagraph 1, article 7, subparagraph 1, and article 24 can be suspended, except when referring to meetings or groups for religious, cultural, economic, and sports purposes . The suspension can affect the entire country or part of it and will be done through a decree issued by the legislative branch or the executive branch, as appropriate . The guarantees contained in article 12, subparagraph 2, and in article 13, subparagraph 2, of the Constitution can be suspended, when the legislative branch so decides by a three-fourths majority vote of the elected deputies, but the administrative suspension Detencion Administrativa should not be longer than 15 days . The suspension of the constitutional guarantees will not exceed 30 days . Once this period expires, the suspension can be extended for a similar period of time, through a new decree, if the circumstances that led to it continue . If that decree is not issued, the suspended guarantees will be fully restored . As you will see, this article States that it is the legislative branch or the executive branch, as appropriate...for that purpose we act based on article 167, no . 6, which reads: it is up to the Council of ministers to suspend and restore the constitutional guarantees mentioned in article 29 of this Constitution if the legislative assembly is not in session."
703,DEV-MUC3-0704,SAN SALVADOR,1989-11-12,"In the first case, the Council of ministers will immediately notify the legislative Assembly's directorate board of the reasons for such a measure and the actions that were carried out in regard to the measure . Salvadoran people, in accordance with the judicial norms stated in our Constitution, today the Council of ministers has decided to declare a state of seige as a measure to protect the Salvadoran people, who are being unjustly attacked by the irrationality and savagery of the Fmln's terrorism, which the government of the Republic cannot and must not allow . tomorrow we will submit to the legislative Assembly's directorate board the minutes of the meeting in which the Council of ministers today decided to suspend the constitutional rights stated in article 29 of the Constitution of the Republic . In this regard, we wish to issue an appeal to the political parties . This is not the time to remain doubtful . Now is the time for all those who intend to work within a democratic system to state--in a categorical manner--that they abide by and support the Republic's institutions and the democratic process that allows them to work and peacefully wage a struggle to attain power . We can no longer allow political parties to question whether or not the Fmln is or is not trying to do away with the rights that the Salvadoran people have demanded time and again in a democratic way . We also urge the diplomatic Corps to tell their respective peoples and governments of the true nature of the Fmln and how it wants to subjugate the Salvadoran people . They must also listen and condemn Daniel Ortega for what he has been saying these days . He should be condemned because he has been trying to confuse the international community by saying that in El Salvador the government has been carrying out indiscriminate bombings . However, everybody here knows that the Fmln has been planting bombs, and so far 8 civilians have been killed and more than 100 have been wounded as a result of that indiscriminate terrorism . It is necessary to condemn Ortega and make him responsible for sending the weapons used to kill and to bleed the Salvadoran people to death . He should no longer be allowed to continue these actions while trying to hide them and to deceive the international community . It is also time to openly condemn the Fmln for its irrational actions . Everybody knows that since the 1ST day of this administration, the government of the Republic offered to begin a dialogue process . It offered to solve this problem through rational and peaceful means, since that is what the Salvadoran people wanted and that is what they demanded on 19 March election day . We can no longer allow the Fmln leaders to travel freely throughout the world in an attempt to Disinform the international community, which instead of falling into the trap of Disinformation should categorically condemn the Fmln's irrational actions . We are not issuing this call to the diplomatic Corps on behalf of the Salvadoran government . We are making this call on behalf of the Salvadoran people, who are subject to the savagery of indiscriminate terrorism . We issue this call because we believe and we are convinced that the Salvadoran people do not deserve this fate . The Salvadoran people do not deserve to be attacked with terrorist bombs . They should not be facing the threats the Fmln is trying to carry out . The Salvadoran people have shown the world during these long 10 years that they want peace, democracy, progress, and do not want to live under systems that are already obsolete in history, that are no longer justified or accepted at this time when the world is evolving toward peace and democracy . on behalf of the people, we are asking you to condemn the Fmln's irrational attitude . We also want to tell the Fmln that the armed forces are supporting their people and will never permit terrorist actions to lead to anything else but the destruction of that movement that has tainted our history . We want them to know that the way to solve problems in El Salvador is through reasoning and peaceful means and that the government of the Republic will continue trying to achieve peace as soon as possible and within that framework: through reasoning and peaceful means . Salvadoran people, again we urge you to remain calm . The Armed Forces are controlling the situation . We will soon live normal lives again . However, at this time we ask all of you to support the peace process, to join forces in order to achieve peace . The Fmln should feel the people's pressure against its irrational actions . We are sure that with you--the Salvadoran people, armed forces, and government--we will achieve peace in El Salvador . God bless you all."

The Army is beginning to have trouble evacuating its wounded, because in the capital episodes are now taking place which had been only seen in Morazan before; that is, helicopters flying in to pick up the wounded, as they did in the valleys and the Plains . This is happening now in the capital because the Army troops cannot advance into certain areas to pick up their dead and wounded, who are very, very numerous . The helicopters now have to land in soccer fields and in other places to evacuate the wounded . Such is the situation in San Salvador .

The Genocidal and cowardly attitude of the Air Force, bombing areas just like Anastasio Somoza did during the last days of his dictatorship, is showing the world : 1 . The Fascist nature of Alfredo Cristiani's regime . The Fascist nature of La Tandona has removed the civilian mask off the government's face and shown its real military and Fascist face . 2 . These bombings prove that as the hours go by they become more desperate and have lost total control of the situation .

The population must remain calm and go to work, while at the same time making sure that you are in your respective residences when the Curfew goes into effect at 1800 . 4 . The Salvadoran population must remain in their residences and stay off the streets, even upon hearing that an Antisubversive operation is taking place nearby--this is particularly necessary for minors . 5 . The Salvadoran population engaged in commercial activities, particularly the sale of staples, must remember that there is a decree that forbids marking up prices, since this would be an Antipatriotic action during these crucial times for the country . 6 .

President Ortega said that the Salvadoran government is attacking the people when the truth is that the Fmln unleashed this terrorist escalation by using weapons and Ammunitions supplied by the Sandinist government . The international community should investigate the Sandinist government's meddling in this criminal attack on the Salvadoran people more closely . the public knows that major crimes have been planned on Nicaraguan territory, even against Fmln leaders . The late top Fmln leader, Cayetano Carpio, ordered the murder of Melida Anaya Montes, whom the rebels called commander Ana Maria from Nicaragua . Fmln commander Joaquin Villalbos, who ordered the murder of Marxist poet Roque Dalton Garcia, continues to live in Nicaragua . The Marxist - Leninist conspiracy which wants to subject the Salvadoran people to a totalitarian dictatorship is planned, led, and implemented on Nicaraguan territory . However, the Salvadoran people, who have suffered for many years from the Bloodthirsty Fmln attacks, know that Fmln is the one who has cruelly murdered children, women, and the elderly, and has not respected sex or age . This is the Fmln that is mercilessly attacking the Salvadoran people . At present, the Salvadoran armed forces are fulfilling their constitutional mandate to protect and defend lives and the properties of Salvadoran society . The Fmln has failed in its terrorist offensive . It entered the city, the way all cowards enter to kill by surprise and in cold blood defenseless people . However, the people's armed wing, namely, the Salvadoran armed forces, have repelled the aggressors who are being directed from Nicaragua with professionalism . so far, not one of the cowardly Fmln leaders has shown up in Salvadoran territory . These criminals have pushed their murderous Hoardes to Indiscriminately fire at the entire civilian population . The Salvadoran people have condemned, rejected, and Repudidated the Fmln's terrorist attack . The murderous leaders believed that the people would rally behind and accompany them in their failed rebellious offensive; they tried to hand out weapons in some towns . just as the people turned their backs on the terrorists at the polls, they reject them now once again because they know that the Fmln is responsible for their hunger, poverty, and suffering . to the free peoples of the world who respect the principle of nonintervention in the internal affairs of States, the Salvadoran people and government demand the condemnation of the meddling by the Sandinist government with its logistical support to the Fmln and that Nicaragua stops lending its territory for the aggression against this nation that wants to live peacefully in democracy based on a respect for the law and full liberty."
724,DEV-MUC3-0725,SAN SALVADOR,1989-11-13,"Colonel Ponce, what is the current military situation in San Salvador and in the other departments? good evening, Salvadoran people . The Armed Forces want to publicly recognize and thank the people for their cooperation during this time when the Fmln terrorist hordes are carrying out an armed aggression against all of our people . The situation in San Salvador can be summarized as follows: fighting is ongoing in the northern part of San Salvador--in Mejicanos, Cuscatancingo, and the Zacamil areas . There are also some clashes in the Northwestern area of Soyapango, in the residential areas of Bosques del Rio, Monte fresco, El Petete, and San Jose . There is some sporadic fighting in Ciudad Credisa, as well as in Santa Marta . that is what we can tell you at this moment about the fighting in the area of San Salvador . in the other departments, on Saturday , 11 November, there was fighting in San Miguel, Santa Ana, Zacatecoluca, Usulutan, and some sporadic fighting in Chalatenango . of all these places, the terrorists increased their aggression today only in Zacatecoluca . The terrorists, unfortunately, took over the hospital in Zacatecoluca, killing one soldier who was receiving medical treatment . The Armed Forces have regained control of the first and second floors of the hospital . approximately 10 to 15 terrorists are on the third and fourth floors, and the trouble is that there are sick people on those floors . So, we believe that the armed aggression, the indiscriminate terrorism that the Fmln has launched at this time in an irrational manner against the Salvadoran people, has been controlled . The Armed Forces are fighting in a professional manner against these terrorists . to sum up, we could then say that there are only a few guerrilla resistance pockets in the areas that you have mentioned . This contradicts the reports from the clandestine radio stations to the effect that they control certain areas . I must also add that there is also some fighting in Ciudad Delgado . I can categorically state that the Fmln does not control any point in our national territory . They are shouting abroad that they control certain points in San Salvador . The people themselves, the media, and the diplomatic Corps are witnesses to the fact the Fmln does not control any places in San Salvador or in the other departments . There are still some Fmln Redoubts, which we are currently controlling in order to expel from the urban areas the terrorists who are attacking the civilian population . Naturally, we have some combat limitations in the urban areas, because the terrorists are shielding themselves behind the civilian population and are holding many families hostages in their own homes . The terrorists have also placed snipers on some tall buildings . that is why the armed forces are asking for the people's understanding . If we were to use our military power, as we could do in a combat zone, we would kill many innocent people."
725,DEV-MUC3-0726,SAN SALVADOR,1989-11-13,"And we not want to do that . We want to resolve this situation in a cautious way, always respecting and protecting our civilian population . that is why we ask those persons who have been kidnapped or are being held hostage by terrorists to be patient . The Salvadoran armed forces are making an effort to reach all the areas where this situation prevails so that we can rescue all of our Salvadoran Brothers . These remarks are intended to reveal the professional nature of the armed forces and reaffirm something many Salvadorans have in mind . regarding this military offensive, has the Fmln received military and personnel aid from abroad? sure, Nicaragua has always supported the Fmln . President Ortega is doing this . The Nicaraguan foreign minister, who is currently in Mexico, is giving his full support to the Fmln . He says that the revolutionary forces have already achieved their victory in El Salvador . The Fmln are liars . They follow the same Communists' slogans: lie, lie, and lie . Here no one believes that . A truck loaded with weapons in Santa Ana was driven by an East German . Some of the captured people are foreigners . I cannot tell you where they come from . your remarks confirm the presence of mercenaries in the current armed struggle, which would be .... I can also add that we received information before 10 November that a group of terrorist fighters had come to the country's Eastern zone from Nicaragua . They may be participating in this terrorist action . As for the total number of casualties inflicted on the Fmln now, can you tell how many Fmln rebels have died in this offensive? nationwide, we counted 230 terrorists killed, and 136 terrorist wounded; 72 terrorist were captured . One terrorist was presented to the press . can the number of civilians killed and wounded be totalled now? that is the most regrettable aspect of this irrational Fmln action . This action has imperiled the people who are not involved in the armed uprising . We regret that 17 people have died and 86 have been wounded . This figure is really regrettable . many people have been tuned into this national network . We have heard many telephone calls reiterating support for the current government and the armed forces' actions . In case of an emergency in areas where the Curfew was ordered . What suggestions can you offer people in the capital city? to report an emergency they can dial 3 if they have a telephone available . Otherwise, or if they do not have a telephone, it is important that they leave their homes with their arms up carrying some white flag or cloth and go to a nearby unit to get aid . people must keep in mind the armed forces are the friends of the people and will serve the people . trust and go to your armed forces . These were the remarks of Col Rene Emilio Ponce . He is now leaving this national radio network . I can tell you that a large number of weapons have been seized . We can confirm the meddling of some Communist bloc countries in this . We seized Russian and North Korean weapons which probably entered through Cuba and Nicaragua . I can also tell you that since the Fmln fired mortars from the National University on Saturday and Sunday morning, we had to remove the terrorists from several points . We found weapons, explosives, and a large amount of medicine inside the National University . Some men were killed with their rifles in their hands; we also captured others who were inside the National University . I also want to ask the civilian population for its understanding and to trust their armed forces . These armed forces belong to the people and serve them . We are acting in a professional manner . be patient, remain calm, and we will move ahead with God's blessing and help . Also, I want to publicly recognize the military Chiefs, officers, enlisted men, security Corps officials, and all the armed forces' active personnel for their heroic work in defending our people, democracy, liberty, and peace . your actions have been heroic, and all of us recognize this . May history do you justice tomorrow . You must feel proud because you are doing what every Patriot must do, defend the Fatherland."

Two columns of some 100 Salvadoran Army troops, armed with rifles and artillery weapons, started to attack about 150 guerrillas who control ample positions in Mejicanos where some 125,000 people live . During that hour, strong explosions were heard near Mejicanos; they later stopped when a heavy rain fell for about 30 minutes . There are no telephone communications with the area; therefore, it has been impossible to determine the balance of the government's counterattack . Meanwhile, it was reported that in the Conacaste neighborhood of Soyapango, also in northern San Salvador, five private homes were Straffed by Army helicopters . The number of casualties has not been determined yet .

We presented dozens of negotiating proposals in which we increasingly made our positions more flexible, even though the military reality demonstrated that we were invincible . We presented to the current nationalist Republican alliance government a proposal that had real possibilities of bringing about peace . However, the response we received was an escalation of repression by means of torture and murder, which culminated with the massacre of the workers of the Salvadoran workers National Union Federation . The government rejected our formulas for negotiation in word and in deed, and instead deepened the causes behind the war by worsening the social crisis and reducing the range of activity of the popular sectors . faced with a dangerous situation that threatened not only to shut off a peaceful solution to the war, but instead to increase the killings and other flagrant violations of our people's democratic rights, the Fmln decided to launch a forceful and strategic military offensive that would put a halt to the fascists and open up a possibility to bring an end to the war . Consequently, at 2000 on 11 November our forces entered into combat against all the targets designated in our offensive plan, despite all the preventive measures and arrangements set up by the Army to try to halt us . Our experienced fighters, in spite of the disadvantage in forces and arms, have fulfilled our goals beyond our expectations, carrying out one of the most glorious military battles in the history of the people's war . In under 15 hours, we gained control over strategic territories, wiped out dozens of enemy troops, took prisoners, recovered weapons, and destroyed armored vehicles and airplanes . After 4 continuous days of fighting, our forces have rejected all Counterattacks by the enemy and have gained new positions . thousands of residents of the cities have staged popular uprisings to support our forces, which have been augmented by new fighters . faced with this situation, the arena government and the clique of corrupt military officers known as La Tandona who command the armed forces, have ordered criminal bombings of the civilian population with the purpose of putting down the popular uprisings . This has brought about more support for our forces and redoubled the people's rage against the government led by Cristiani and the Army . a situation has thus come about which demands that our forces carry out the decision to continue the offensive that our forces and the people have unleashed until its final consequences."

The enemy of the people and all of our country's social and political forces is La Tandona, who have enriched themselves with war, and the arena death squads . They are the enemies of peace and democracy . They are the ones who do not want a regime of justice .

They are cowards who have Treacherously attacked and bombed the people . a few hours ago, the liar terrorist Joaquin Villalobos, from his hotel room in Managua--where he has air conditioning and lots of food--said that the Fmln has seized positions, which is not true . All towns in the country are under the government's political control and under the armed forces' military control .

He said that a political solution was being sought in Central America and with this action, we had broken the political path and sought other options . I think the people who broke the path are the United States . We must recall that while we were holding talks in San Jose, Costa Rica and demanding the removal of La Tandona and demanding justice against the death squads in order to find a political solution and participate in elections, the U.S. government approved more aid for the Fascist sectors, the very sectors that were in fact repressing the people and carrying out such dramatic and horrible actions as the one perpetrated against the Fenastras building . These actions continue and have been repeated every day in El Salvador . Therefore, the first ones to bury the political possibility were the United States . The first ones to give weapons to the fascists to continue killing people were the United States . The Salvadoran people cannot wait for the fascists to kill them all . that is no way to attain peace, much less democracy in El Salvador . that is what the United States did . right now when we are involved in an offensive, who are the ones guilty of genocide against the people? the United States . Those bombs and those rockets that are falling on civilians are bombs and rockets provided by the U.S. administration to the Salvadoran Army . The ones who have blocked the possibility of peace and negotiation in El Salvador are the United States .

748,DEV-MUC3-0749,SAN SALVADOR,1989-11-14,"Good evening, Salvadoran people--if I may say, so despite the circumstances affecting the capital city . It is regrettable and inconceivable that the Farabundo Marti National liberation front should persist with the aggression it has unleashed against our capital city and surrounding municipalities . Our population has suffered the most from this Fmln aggression . This aggression, Salvadoran friends, must be seen as an act of desperation by the Fmln, as this is the only way we can explain their irrational actions . I have used the word desperation because the Fmln knows that it is out of style and that its attitudes are no longer accepted in the world . We can see in Europe that countries have passed from totalitarian regimes such as the one that the Fmln wants to implement here, and walls are open for liberty and democracy . We are sure that this is what the Salvadoran people want: liberty and democracy . that is why they have not supported and will never support the Fmln terrorists who want to subject the Salvadoran people to totalitarian regimes, to Dictatorships of oppression, repression, and violation of human rights . I was saying that this is a desperate act because we cannot see how anyone who is not desperate could cause so much harm to innocent people and to the civilian population . There are already more than 100 dead or wounded because of the Fmln's irrational actions . of course, to that we must add that they destroyed many homes which they entered and have held families as hostages . They have damaged the electricity, Potable water, and telephone systems, depriving the population of those essential services, not to mention the lack of food affecting the civilian population in the areas where they are holding hostages . In addition, it is appropriate to see how far the Fmln terrorists' irrational minds can go, because they have carried out acts of savagery that we cannot understand . How can there still be anyone like the Nicaraguans--and I am talking about the Nicaraguan government, of course, not all Nicaraguans--and the Cubans, who support such acts of savagery . holding civilians as hostages, putting them in the middle so that they will be the ones who are hurt, and shielding themselves behind innocent people is an act of savagery, Salvadoran people . taking over a center for orphan children in order to protect themselves behind little children who do not have a father or a mother is an act of savagery, Salvadoran people . They even did something worse at the Zacatecoluca hospital and the people witnessed this . When they entered the hospital in Zacatecoluca, they murdered, at Gunpoint, a soldier who was receiving medical attention; they placed bombs inside the hospital and then fled . Salvadoran people: the Fmln is already a desperate beast . This is the only thing we can say about such irrational minds . However, we must realize and understand, and above all, be sure that the majority of our people repudiate the Fmln terrorists . The people must know that they can count on their armed forces which have advanced slowly, but surely . It is advancing slowly because it wants to fully protect the lives of civilians . The Armed Forces could drive those terrorists out of where they are; however, there are civilians there, and we would never want to expose those civilians to the danger the Fmln is trying to lead them into . The Armed Forces have continued to advance . They have effectively advanced, using professional means . for example, neighborhoods such as Bosques del Rio are totally calm now, because the armed forces have already entered and forced the terrorists out . We know that all of you would like to see an end to this terror that the Fmln wants to create . However, we must also understand, particularly those of us who are not as anguished at this moment as those families that have become Fmln hostages . They too, deserve that we do everything we can to achieve our objective; however, we must do so respecting the lives of those innocent people . The Fmln failed to achieve its objective."
749,DEV-MUC3-0750,HAVANA ,1989-11-15,"Commander in chief Fidel Castro Ruz, first Secretary of the Communist party of Cuba and president of the councils of State and ministers, last night granted an exclusive interview to our reporter, Oscar Suarez, at the inauguration of the Madrid restaurant in Habana Vieja . today is an important day . today, when we are commemorating the 470th anniversary of Havana, we received the news of the crushing triumph of the South-West African people's organization in the Namibian elections by 57 percent . It is a very good percentage . on the other hand, we also received the news .... we admire the heroism with which the Salvadorans are fighting . It is something very impressive . It is a like a lesson to imperialism which is euphoric and thinks that the world is at its feet . They think that...which is terrible . I believe the actions that the Salvadorans are presently carrying out are one of the most extraordinary feats that have ever been written . Despite the 10 years, the billions that the United States has invested in creating the Salvadoran Army and supplying it with the most modern types of arms, notice how those people can fight . notice what is being done . How are they using the Yankee bombs and planes? they are being used to massacre the Salvadoran people . Just notice how they are Indiscriminately bombing the people's neighborhoods which are in the hands of the Revolutionaries . what the imperialists are doing is something repugnant . However, I think that what the Salvadorans are doing is amazing, admirable . what they are doing is showing the imperialists that the people are far from kneeling before them . their actions are showing imperialism that the people will continue fighting without caring about the euphoria that currently overcomes them under these circumstances . commander, what else can you say on the subject of why we have so many friends? we, the Cubans are what we are because we are a mixture of Spanish and African . I think we have the friends we do because we have followed a policy of principle . I think the friends we have are basically due to the prestige of the Revolution, the respect the revolution merits, the ethics of the Revolution, and the principles of the revolution . Now, the fact that we are also a mixture of Caribbeans, that is something else . that has nothing to do with politics . reasons we can have congeniality . However, congeniality does not always turn into true friendship . There could be congeniality but it does not result in friendship . friendship is more a result of recognition, admiration for a country . do you believe that...this small country was facing the Empire, it became a bastion of dignity for the world . I think this merits certain recognition and liking . We can be proud of that and of the friends we have . I appreciate these friends who are friends of Cuba despite Yankee pressures . They are friends of Cuba despite Yankee threats, intrigues, and campaigns . This says a lot . The Yankees wanted to bury and discredit the revolution with the media agencies they own . However, they have not been able to achieve that . that is why under these circumstances we really appreciate the friendship and solidarity that other nations render us . aside, from that, we are Caribbeans . We are a good mixture . We are a mixture of which we are proud . We are a mixture of Indian, African, and European . that mixture has turned out to be very good . We also have Chinese mixture in us . that is true, you are correct in reminding us of it . I think this mixture has also helped to enrich the virtues of our nation."

This absurd massacre and the Genocidal bombings against heavily populated areas in San Salvador and San Miguel have been ordered by Alfredo Cristiani and the armed forces' high command, and are part of a Counterinsurgent plan to destroy the political opposition and create a state of terror among the civilian population . public death threats were made against priest Ignacio Ellacuria over the armed forces national network .

We feel that these incidents further complicate our country's critical situation . groups or minds want to hamper the democratic process, especially the peace process that the government of the Republic has tried to advance and will continue to pursue . from the start we ordered an investigation because we believe that now that the people and all of the country's institutions have supported the peace process, it is no longer possible to continue having these savage incidents take place that are aimed at blocking this process . We have made preliminary investigations that merely tell us how things happened . We have already taken some procedural steps, such as where the impact was felt and where the crimes were perpetrated . In sum, we did the things normally done at the start of these kinds of investigations . There is a possible witness to these crimes, but, unfortunately, he has not been located so that he can be questioned by the investigators . They will certainly make every effort to locate him so that he can provide information that will clarify this regrettable incident . I suppose the Jesuits' provincial will host a news conference . You have many of the details, so we are going to skip them . The only things we have found are fingerprints that are being studied and Shell casings from Ak-47 and M-16 rifles . We will submit them for ballistic tests . We will also conduct Forensic tests, which will begin soon . Another important detail is that inside the building there was a room or library with Video cassettes . It was like a studio . This room looked like it had been burned after being ransacked . all these things and other details have been reported and submitted to the investigators . We also talked to the Jesuits' provincial and told him that we were determined to get to the bottom of this . We asked him for his help, and he expressed his readiness to assist in the investigation . We are grateful for this help because in the past cooperation with the authorities has not always been forthcoming . We hope that with this help and with the remarks by Msgr Arturo Rivera Y Damas, with whom we also spoke this morning, this case will not be politicized and justice can be served, avoiding reaching hasty or Biased conclusions by any of group or party . We think and agree with Msgr Rivera Y Damas that this is how a serious investigation should be conducted . We hope that this investigation will lead us to the heart of the matter . regardless of who the Perpetrators are, we want punishment for those attempting to hinder the process of peace and democracy in El Salvador . and so we begin the questions . Perhaps Mr Sandoval or Ana Maria may Wanto help us to put some order . First, the government communique repeats ECO ECO reports, which mention unknown terrorists . regardless of the side that is involved, this is the way to describe these actions . These are terrorist actions because of their overall context, no matter who . Let me repeat: We have comments by church officials who were giving versions that have not been corroborated . We have been told there were several persons wearing uniforms, to cite these versions verbatim . I do not want to excuse or accuse anyone, but I feel that is not a categorical proof . today, many people who do not belong to the armed forces are wearing uniforms . Let me repeat: one cannot say one thing or another, but I do think this must be investigated . If members of the armed forces are found to be involved, they will feel the full weight of the law."

The bodies of Ellacuria and his Jesuit companions Ignacio Martin Baro, Segundo Montes, Juan Ramon Moreno, Armando Lopez, and Joaquin Lopez, as well as domestic Elba Ramos and her 15-year-old daughter, were riddled with bullets, while some also had their skills crushed . The death of the priests, five of them Spaniards, who were always in favor of a negotiated solution to the crisis, has increased the fear and desperation felt by the Salvadorans since the past weekend, when violent fighting broke out between the guerrillas and soldiers in the northern part of San Salvador . The priests were killed by some 30 men wearing olive drab uniforms who broke into the place, according to witnesses who were there, Tojeira explained . The priest recalled that over the weekend the government radio network``launched fierce attacks against the, saying that a few priests had to be killed in this country or that they had to be placed in front of the cathedral so that the people could kill them by spitting at them ,""Tojera noted . Also, he added that on Monday armed forces members raided the homes of Ellacuria and companions .``on that occasion they were quite correct, according to what father Ellacuria told me ,""added Tojeira, who was quite upset during the news conference .``apparently the men said they had reports that there were weapons in the residences . of course they found nothing, and father Ellacuria invited them to return on Tuesday and go through the Uca campus, but they did not do so .""also, Tojeira confirmed that on Wednesday afternoon and evening there was tight security in the vicinity of the Uca in the Southern part of the capital .``I do not know if the soldiers left the place later, but up until 2200 on Wednesday, hours before the horrible massacre, the soldiers were there ,""Tojeira added .``these are the facts . Therefore, we share the opinion of Archbishop Arturo Rivera--that the ones responsible are the same ones who assassinated Msgr Romero ,""he added."

In San Miguel city, the 3D infantry Brigade command has been operating in a professional manner, and it has avoided harming the civilian population; therefore, there are terrorists in the neighborhoods . also in Usulutan last night and early this morning, but at present only some explosions and some sporadic firing are heard in the vicinity of the city of Usulutan . In Zacatecoluca yesterday we managed to control the population completely . We dislodged the terrorists from the 27 September neighborhood . We have had serious problems in the capital city . The Fmln has waged its greatest efforts here . They are terrorists, and they should be considered as such . In some neighborhoods in the northern area, the Mejicanos, as of Sunday , 12 November . In some as it was yesterday . Although it is true of the capital city . In Mejicanos, in the neighborhood, North of the Guadalupe and Soyapango neighborhoods, Reparto Santa Marta, and Altos del . In this area, the armed forces have carried out actions to defend the Salvadoran people to neutralize this Genocide . on the national level, I would like to announce some partial results . The Armed Forces have sustained the following : 177 dead and 251 wounded . Among the terrorists there are 655 dead and 491 wounded . We have captured 92 Fmln members, and 6 Fmln terrorists have turned themselves in . As for the civilians, we regret 47 persons have died, and 153 have been wounded .

I also want to inform you that after visiting this afternoon the various areas where we are, the morale of our troops and officers is very high . and there is a reason for this, because they are fighting to defend you . The Fmln terrorists have a very low morale, many, because they are now aware of their casualties and . I want to avail myself of this opportunity and on behalf of the armed forces, to strongly condemn those who this morning massacred six Jesuit priests . We regret as well the deaths of other civilians, innocent people who have nothing to do with this conflict . We also regret the deaths among our Armed Forces . It is also important to mention that the government, the people, and the armed forces general command are proud of the professional work being done at the various Garrisons of our Armed Forces . Salvadoran people, on behalf of the armed forces, we ask for your support . You must continue going to work and continue working .

Today we completed an arch of freedom in San Salvador by extending and connecting several areas under our control, after Repelling and swamping the government's special battalions in five Counterattacks supported by armored vehicles and aerial bombings . Our fighters displayed singular heroism during the occupation of the Cuscatancingo headquarters and the commands in Mejicanos and Ciudad Delgado, where we captured a large arsenal of weapons and ammunition, and during clashes in, Soyapango, Ciudad Merliot, and . The Fmln also has forces along the leading routes to the capital city; these forces harass and hinder Army Deployments on the Pan-American highway, and on the San Salvador-Santa Tecla highway .

We stress our permanent Harassment of enemy forces in Zacatecoluca, Chalatenango, Santa Ana, Apopa, San Martin, San Marcos, Nueva Concepcion, Santa Elena, and other towns . Transportation has been paralyzed since the Fmln declared a stoppage, and most of the country is without electricity due to sabotage . The critical deadline the high command set for itself to recover our positions has passed, and our forces have assaulted headquarters in controlled areas and have requisitioned weapons and ammunition . hundreds of youths continue to join our Army . Without popular support the Fmln would not have achieved Political-Military victories of such dimensions as to take the enemy by surprise and earn the world's admiration . in the past 2 days the Fmln has inflicted dozens of casualties among the Army's officers and troops, and it has taken five prisoners of war, among whom are a captain and a lieutenant, whose physical and mental well being has been respected . The Fmln has seized 63 rifles , 4 Machineguns , 3 grenade launchers , 5 Prc-77 radios, , and thousands of rounds of ammunition from the occupied headquarters and commands . We call on all the people to join the uprising against the Fascist Genocide . We ask the officers and troops not to continue serving in an Army that is behaving like a foreign occupation army, the civilian population, executing priests, and Massacring labor leaders . in the cities and countryside, a sea of guerrillas."

This could save the lives of the persons arrested this morning by the National Guard, a Bloodthirsty guard that is reliving the last days of the Somozist guard . The killing of priests and now the arrest of two priests and several missionaries further CONFIRMS that the regime is on the verge of collapsing, that it is desperate and no longer cares about the international community, pressure, or requests for an end to the bombings and bloodshed .

Codeh has done nothing to promote peace and respect for human rights, because it is supporting and promoting the recruitment, training, and actions of guerrilla groups, which are destabilizing and sowing violence among Democratic peoples .

774,DEV-MUC3-0775,CLANDESTINE,1989-11-17,"We recently heard U.S . Ambassador William Walker on a Salvadoran television newscast . He said no one knew exactly who had planned the murder of father Ignacio Ellacuria and the other Jesuit priests who were assassinated early yesterday morning . radio Venceremos tells William Walker that his cynicism is beyond the limit . William Walker knows perfectly well which General staff office issued the order to assassinate the Jesuit priests . William Walker knows that on the night of 11 November radio Cuscatlan urged the people to assassinate Ignacio Ellacuria, Ruben Zamora, and doctor Guillermo Ungo . The whole world .... the International media has featured the recording in which radio Cuscatlan--the armed forces general staff's radio, meaning the radio controlled by the armed forces general staff, the radio in which not a single word, not a single comma goes out without the approval of the censors which have been imposed on radio Cuscatlan - - death . Therefore, William Walker knows perfectly well where the order came from; he knows the exact time that 40 uniformed men left in Curfew, a few blocks from Colonel Rene Emilio Ponce's office . William Walker's cynicism went beyond the limit when he said that he does not know or who planned Ignacio Ellacuria's assassination . William Walker is doing a historical imitation of the filibuster who came to Central America in 1856 to subjugate our people and become president of a central American nation, meaning Nicaragua, who decreed that English be the official language, and that the U.S . flag become the occupation forces' flag . Wiliam Walker is Re- editing a shameful chapter in Central America's history . William Walker, the U.S . Ambassador in our homeland, is Re-Editing--in the form of a caricature--a historical event which occurred in the 19th century . However, we want to tell something to the new William Walker, who has been featured in press and television news reports giving figures which differ even from those given by Col Ponce; the new William Walker, who thinks he is president of the Republic and is better than Cristiani and Col Ponce, so he gives invented figures on guerrilla casualties; the new William Walker, who evaluates the nation's political and military situation, even before Cristiani and Ponce do so, even Contradicting Col Ponce's figures . William Walker said 40 members of the Fmln were captured, yet the Bleary-Eyed Col Ponce last night talked about 9 Fmln members . where, then, are the rest of the captured Fmln fighters? humanitarian groups should pay attention to that contradiction between President William Walker and his subordinate, Col Ponce . Red Cross International, green cross, and amnesty International must demand that William Walker say where the captured guerrilla fighters are, because Col Ponce only mentions nine fighters . Col Ponce talks about nine and the other one talks about dozens . The international community must pay close attention to the contradiction between President William Walker and his subordinate, Col Ponce . where are the other captured fighters? most of them were surely civilians who have nothing to do with the conflict . They must have been caught in the war zones and then presented to the media as dead guerrilla fighters . We demand, before the international community, that Ambassador William Walker clearly say how Col Ponce could have been mistaken when admitting that only nine guerrilla fighters were captured--while the U.S . Ambassador personally revealed the figures that should have been revealed by President Cristiani a long time ago--even if they were imaginary figures . William Walker must answer this question: where are the guerrilla fighters?"

776,DEV-MUC3-0777,HAVANA ,1989-11-17,"Fighting continues today in San Salvador, and for the first time, the Triumphalist tone of the Salvadoran Army begins to change . An ap Cable we received this morning in our Newsroom says the following: the armed forces have acknowledged they have serious problems in various suburbs of this capital . This is what the ap Cable says Textually in its headline . In addition to this situation, there is another fact in the battlefield to which the news agencies have not paid much attention, which is also a reflection of the type of combat that the Salvadoran forces are fighting . ap itself says the following: the war became dirty with the murder of six Jesuit priests and two women by unidentified terrorists who acted during the Curfew . Furthermore, the Cable says that the Canadian embassy in San Salvador reported that 12 workers from the Lutheran Church were arrested by uniformed security individuals in downtown San Salvador . at the beginning, the Cable said that the six priests had been murdered by unidentified terrorists . later, they are identified as uniformed individuals . Among the priests murdered was father Ignacio Ellacuria, Rector of the central American university and director of a magazine which reflected the peoples' thoughts, not only in El Salvador but also in the rest of Central America . none of these priests belonged to the Farabundo Marti National liberation front . Furthermore, Ellacuria himself on several occasions expressed opinions which did not concur with those of the Fmln . However, he felt that a solution to the Salvadoran problem could not exclude the people's inclusion of the Fmln . The assassins who acted under the protection of the Curfew are from the Salvadoran Army, they are not unidentified terrorists, like the ap Cable says . They are assassins of the Salvadoran Army, the same Army which has all the support of the U.S. government . In this, we can also see the double standard of the Bush administration . on the one hand, all its publicity apparatus says to the world that Washington is in favor of democracy and respect for human rights . However, in practice, it supports the assassins of priests and supplies bombs and rockets so that the Salvadoran Army--which has planes and helicopters provided by the United States--can bomb the Salvadoran civilian population . These are the facts . This is the truth that Yankee propaganda is hiding and manipulating."

We repeat, Mr ambassador to El Salvador, the following is our clue: find out who ordered the arrest of the priests and missionaries, including a U.S. citizen . find out immediately, and you better move quickly, otherwise they could be killed . There lies your answer . ask whether the two priests were arrested by the Fmln or the armed forces . We insist, if there is a single drop of decency left in you, check the Elena Fuentes statements against the church monitored a few days ago . Mr Ambassador William Walker, if there is a single drop of decency left in you, check the recordings the U.S. Embassy has of radio Cuscatlan and listen to what they said about father Ignacio Ellacuria, Msgr Rivera Y Damas, and Msgr Gregorio Rosa Chavez on the night of 11 November and earlier . gentlemen at the U.S. Embassy who are monitoring us, help the ambassador . go to your files, find the radio Cuscatlan recordings and take them to the ambassador's office . monitors at the embassy, help that Absentminded Ambassador . monitors at the embassy, give him a hand; it seem that the ambassador's memory is failing him . monitors, you who are so efficient, we ask you to help the ambassador regain his memory . take him Col Elena Fuente's recording accusing the Church of having ties with the Fmln . take him Col montano's statements, take him Col Zepeda's statements, take him Roberto D'Aubuisson's statements, accusing father Ignacio Ellacuria of being the director of the war in El Salvador . help us U.S. Embassy monitors because it seems that Mr William Walker has a very short memory."

He died a few minutes ago at Rosales hospital . The Fmln terrorists do not satisfy their instincts by killing civilians and the Uca Jesuits, now they are aiming their criminal Machineguns at journalists . The Salvadoran government and the people, together with the glorious armed forces, repeat their call to the international community to repudiate the Fmln assassins . The civilians who gave Blundy first aid have told us that the newsman was hit by an Fmln sniper when he was greeting an officer of our glorious armed forces in Mejicanos . This action once more confirms the treacherous and flagrant human rights violations of the Fmln assassins, who are being repudiated by the Salvadoran people."
779,DEV-MUC3-0780,CLANDESTINE,1989-11-17,"Comrade Villalobos referred to the bombings and the killing of the Jesuit priests . This is the question he was asked: in the past few hours, several governments and humanitarian organizations have pressured the government to stop the bombings and the bloodshed in our homeland . However, despite this international pressure, the Jesuit priests were killed in San Salvador . Therefore, what is the intention behind the bombings? What intention did the armed forces' general staff have in killing the Jesuits? commander Villalobos replied: first, it must be said that the killing of the Jesuit priests by the Cristiani government was a harsh blow to the possibilities for an effective democracy in our country . The Jesuit priests are a sector of Salvadoran society that has made and continues to make great contributions to our people's education . They taught us how to debate, the need to reason things out, and the need to have political pluralism . However, it is evident that the Salvadoran armed forces, the sectors, and Mr. Cristiani cannot stand intelligent people, the debates, the analyses, and the people's reasoning . This is why they committed this crime . The responsibility for this crime becomes evident, not only based on direct circumstances such as the fact that it was carried out by uniformed men during the Curfew period and that a few days before the crime a group of military men checked out the place where they were going to commit the crime--clearly intending to prepare a plan--but because of accusations against the Jesuits made over the national network . We must also bear in mind that this crime was a political mistake made by the dictatorship . It was a miscalculation on the part of those who made that decision . We have already mentioned that the armed forces have been unable to stop the Fmln . They could not stop the Fmln plan . Once we began to implement the plan a very critical situation . within the framework of this critical situation, they took the wrong step . The day before the crime the armed forces began a strategy to wear out the Fmln, Logistically . We must not ignore the fact that the armed forces' calculations were based on the assumption that the Fmln forces would become exhausted . We would have made a serious mistake if we had begun this plan without Foreseeing all these circumstances . However, the armed forces based their calculations on our possible exhaustion . Consequently, based on those calculations, they figured that they had 3 or 4 days to launch a counterattack . So, the day prior to the killing of the Jesuit priests, they launched several offensives--I rather call them Counteroffensives--to try to dislodge us from our positions . their tactic was to make us waste ammunition . They were not really trying to make us abandon our positions yet . However, our fighters, in addition to saving our ammunition, have the material and human resources so they inflicted many casualties on the armed forces and wore them out . But it seems that the armed forces did not realize that and felt that they could launch a big counterattack to annihilate the Fmln forces . based on that, they came up with a plan that was not only military but political . The U.S . Ambassador, the U.S. advisers, the Bush administration, and who knows who else were informed about this plan . They made the wrong interpretation of the calls made by the International Red Cross and other humanitarian organizations on the need to have a truce to evacuate civilians . They thought that we made these calls and based on that, they felt that they could proceed to a Counteroffensive . based on that, let us analyze the propaganda and information disseminated on the day prior to the killing of the Jesuits . The U.S . Ambassador himself explained a war report and gave an update on the situation . Thus, they thought that the Fmln was going to suffer a great political and military defeat in the next few hours . They had an overall plan."
780,DEV-MUC3-0781,CLANDESTINE,1989-11-17,"The Army carried out a large bomb attack on northern San Salvador in an effort to weaken our positions . They thought they were going to have a victory there . But it just so happens that, aside from all the propaganda they used and the plan to weaken us militarily, the armed forces attacked Union offices and the homes of leaders of popular movements in various sectors . apparently, everyone had gone into hiding and they only found the wife of a university leader and they killed her . They also found the Jesuits . It seems that in view of recent talks with Cristiani, father Ellacuria had become very trusting . He thought that nothing would happen to them . This situation so they did not protect themselves in the face of the danger of a possible action such as this crime . on the same night when the entire northern San Salvador area was being bombed, the Jesuits were killed . What was their intention? they thought they were to obtain a military victory and set out to carry out a witch Hunt . They set out to kill all opposition members that one night, with the idea that they were going to wipe out the Fmln, militarily . based on that assumption, they decided to carry out this action to guarantee for themselves a few more years of stability through the peace of Cemeteries, regardless of the consequences . What really happened? the day after they committed the crime, they launched their offensive to annihilate the Fmln . They thought this was going to be their decisive day, but the offensive failed . their attack was repelled, they sustained many casualties, and loss much materiel . their troops were further beaten and they did not obtain any effective military results . Consequently, their Counteroffensive was rejected and the blow they thought they were going to deal to the leaders of the popular movement failed, on the one hand because some of these leaders were hiding and on the other because they committed an horrendous crime and it Backfired . It was a crime by the general staff and Mr. Cristiani knew about it . Cristiani clearly and probably even the U.S. Embassy could be involved in this . They thought that by killing all opposition members, they were going to achieve definite peace in El Salvador . This is very clear . But this action Backfired . It was a painful incident, but it is an incident that is going to BACKFIRE for the government . It is going to result in great isolation for the regime, at a moment when the Fmln is stronger . at a moment when the Fmln has a political, military, and strategic advantage . The murder of the Jesuits is suicide for the regime . I really do not understand it . They made a very serious mistake . In addition, they confirmed a truth we have been maintaining: they are Fascists and assassins . They must leave power . They have created a situation in which the possibility for an Fmln victory is great . They have created a situation in which the disappearance of the most conservative Oligarchic sectors of the Salvadoran society will be caused by their own mistakes."

Chavez MENA, who was the Pdc presidential candidate in the past elections, said that one of the ways to solve the Civil War problem would be for the government to rectify its stand and initiate new negotiations . We should all sit down to find a solution, he told newsmen, adding that neither side will achieve a military victory . Meanwhile, Centeno stated that the bombings in Densely populated areas and the murder of six Jesuit priests are factors that are wearing out the government and the armed forces high command .

Although there is not a general consensus, the political and labor groups have said they are in favor of a negotiated solution and the resumption of a dialogue with the presence of the OAS and the United Nations as well as the central American Presidents as guarantors of the agreements . However, the petition might not be received well by a government that is apparently not willing to negotiate a cease-fire with the rebels who continue occupying the neighborhoods in the northern area of the capital city."

Cristiani's government and the Salvadoran Army have lost control over their actions because of their desperation over the Fmln's victorious advance . The Fmln forces have not only maintained their positions, but have also increased them in San Salvador and throughout the remaining Salvadoran territory . acting out of revenge, Cristiani's government and the Salvadoran Army began a series of criminal actions aimed at all those who have identified themselves with the fair causes of the Salvadoran majority . as a result, early on the morning of 16 November, six Jesuit priests and two humble women who worked with them were brutally murdered . We share the enormous pain of the Salvadoran people and that of the Jesuit communities . We add our protest to the voices of all those who have protested against such a vile murder .

The fighting waged in San Salvador, San Miguel, Usulutan, Zacatecoluca, Santa Ana, and other parts in the country have been possible thanks to the leading role played by the people who have supported and joined the struggle . The 7 days of our offensive have exposed the military Fascist dictatorship to the eyes of the world . The dictatorship has removed its civilian mask, and it has shown its barbaric nature as it bombed cities and murdered Jesuit priests, who were members of a national conscience that is seeking social changes and peace in El Salvador . These crimes committed by Cristiani and Colonel Ponce definitely isolate them from the rest of the world, which condemns them and recalls the last days of Somoza . in the meantime, the U.S. Congress discusses cutting military aid to the regime .

The Fmln looks favorably on these efforts, and it has already actively joined these national sectors who are opposed to the genocide being carried out by the high command in a suicidal attempt to preserve the war that it has turned into a business deal .

The crime committed today was sponsored by the same ones who are now planning general Manuel Antonio Noriega's murder . There is only a difference of time and place . Instead of bombing Densely populated neighborhoods, these people are resorting to attacks on certain figures and leaders . because of the enormous size of the Latin American crisis, it is evident that the church cannot escape the demand that modern times impose on all groups of deciding whether to be on the side of patriotic and libertarian causes or to become accomplices of local and foreign oppressors . like Msgr Romero, father Ellacuria and his companions in martyrdom represent the church that is born from the homeland and that struggles along with the people . Panamanian general Omar Torrijos also decided to work along with the people from inside the armed forces . These Martyrs deserve the same solidarity they gave to the Latin American cause of national liberation, because they challenged the Oligarchy, imperialism, and even the reactionary groups of their own church . Now, when all the weight of the Latin American crisis and foreign aggression falls upon the Salvadoran and Panamanian peoples; now that the Salvadoran people are Massively repressed; and now that the government in Washington orders the CIA to attack Gen Noriega, those who struggle in El Salvador and those who Patriotically resist are in fact doing so for all of Latin America . Thus, Ignacio Ellacuria's and his partners' sacrifice, as well as the previous sacrifice of Msgr Romero and that of Gen Noriega, will bear fruits of liberation, justice, and sovereignty . These fruits will be plentiful and more delicious if all those who have been next to and learned from these people continue struggling with their example in mind . The sacrifice they have made for all of us deserves praise and solidarity . We offer them that praise and solidarity by reaffirming our commitment to work and struggle for the definitive liberation of our own people .

809,DEV-MUC3-0810,CLANDESTINE,1989-11-19,"Commander Roberto Roca, the repercussions of the Jesuits' were not long in coming . one of the most significant ones was the editorial of an important U.S . newspaper, the New York times, on 18 November . The editorial says, among other things, that if President Alfredo Cristiani does not order a quick, thorough, and genuine investigation to catch the assassins, he might lose the United States' economic aid . The editorial also States the Democrats in Congress have said that the military aid should be suspended if El Salvador cannot control and punish the death squads . They add that if he does not heed the warning, the next statement might be issued by both parties . What are the implications of this important statement by an influential U.S . newspaper for Cristiani's government and the Salvadoran armed forces? actually, the New York Times States the feeling pervading the entire United States . It is a way of confirming that the Fascist groups prevail within the government and arena, and they are deciding the regime's policies . political opinion in the United States has undoubtedly been shaken by this massacre planned by Alfredo Cristiani's government . We believe that U.S . politicians will progressively come to support the U.S. people's feelings and will demand that Cristiani's government order the investigation . We know that this will not be easy in El Salvador, because, as the editorial points out, similar assassinations have been perpetrated innumerable times . These cases have been surrounded by absolute secrecy; no culprits are found; and witnesses have testified many times that the actions were carried out by armed forces members, either dressed as civilians or in uniform . However, the policy of the armed forces and the government protects the culprits . We believe that this civilian assassination, meaning the assassination of the Jesuit priests, the fact that practically all the leaders of the labor movement were sought out that same night to be killed, plus the fact that the killing of the cooperative members was carried out within the framework of the great battles being fought in El Salvador's urban areas, will eventually convince U.S . politicians that the government they have been supporting is clearly a Fascist government which has absolutely no interest in any kind of democratic consolidation."
810,DEV-MUC3-0811,CLANDESTINE,1989-11-19,"Real life is making it evident that in El Salvador we must find a Democratic solution to the terrible crisis being endured--to the war . This Democratic solution means isolating and excluding the fascists from power because they are against democracy . Mr Cristiani cannot say under these circumstances that he shares no responsibility in the murder of the Jesuits . in the framework of his frustrated attempt to stop the guerrilla offensive, he unleashed the dogs of war--all the Fascist elements--so that they would commit all the outrages they have committed . This includes the Fascist elements in the Air force and their indiscriminate bombing of the civilian population, as well as the death squads, who were unleashed so they would murder people who best express the Democratic feelings of the people and, as in the case of the Jesuit priests, to eliminate a valuable sector of the Salvadoran intelligentsia at the service of democracy and social justice . As we all know, the Jesuits had continuously denounced the unjust system in El Salvador and had called for clearing up all crimes . The Fascists, in their hatred, put an end to the lives of these Jesuits believing that they can hide the sun with one finger . The indignation of the Salvadoran people will be increasingly backed by the U.S. people as a result of their indignation and by U.S . politicians who have become aware of the fact that it is necessary to put an end to Fascist outrages in El Salvador . The Fascists represent a barrier that must be destroyed and defeated to have democracy in El Salvador . commander, if the United States decided to cut off military and economic aid to the Salvadoran government, what impact would this have on the armed forces? we have said on many occasions that the Salvadoran armed forces would have lost the war some time ago were it not for U.S. support and financing . As we have stated in all our proposals for a political solution, our objective is neither the destruction nor the elimination of the armed forces . What we want is for the armed forces to get rid of the Fascist elements that have turned it into a tool that acts against the people and democracy . We believe that sensible Salvadoran armed forces officers, those who have not lost their heads, must take into consideration indiscriminate bombing, the political defeat of the Cristiani government, and the military defeat of the methods and tactics."
811,DEV-MUC3-0812,CLANDESTINE,,"Therefore, the Western European press, political parties, labor unions, and general public are very strongly rejecting Cristiani's regime . The Congresses and parliaments of many Western European countries are saying that the cooperation the Salvadoran regime receives should be Reevaluated . comrade Salvador Samayoa, the government network is reporting that U.S. aid to Cristiani will continue . The colonels have also said that the Fmln cannot defeat the armed forces because the latter has military and economic aid from the U.S. government . returning to this point, comrade Samayoa, what is your view? What options does the U.S. government have concerning El Salvador, and what impact has the new situation had on U.S. policy toward El Salvador? as I said, the U.S. government must take into consideration that a new internal situation of generalized popular, political, and social discontent is taking shape, and that from this moment on its policy in El Salvador will undergo isolation and will be rejected by the American people, and even by very important sectors within the house and Senate . so far, the U.S. administration has stubbornly continued providing aid and support to a regime that is obviously criminal and Genocidal, and that policy is currently a very strong debate in the United States . The options available to the U.S. government are to sink with the Cristiani regime, which is obviously moving toward defeat and military and political destruction despite all the propaganda it has made, or to change its opinion while there is still time . The alternative of a change of government, a replacement of Cristiani's regime or the military hierarchy, is already under discussion . These, therefore, are the two alternatives available to the United States: either change its policy in time and replace Cristiani, or the government will sink because its propaganda is not working . The U.S . Ambassador has made a fool of himself . He said the guerrillas had 1,500 men in San Salvador, and he has listed casualty figures according to which the Fmln suffered over 500 deaths, over 400 wounded, and others captured . According to the figures quoted by the U.S . Ambassador, who provides government war bulletins and has almost become the Salvadoran defense Minister, the Fmln only has 200 men left in San Salvador . What I find inexplicable is the government's need to use 40 or 50 war planes and helicopters, along with its artillery and elite battalions, to bomb and destroy cities, especially San Salvador . that is why their propaganda has Backfired on them . in the United States the press and general public know full well that the Fmln offensive is in full force and is moving forward, and that the U.S. policy is reaching the point of total failure . to conclude, comrade Samayoa, what is your message on radio Venceremos to the comrades who have maintained their positions in San Salvador, San Miguel, Zacatecoluca, Usulutan, and various points of the National territory? What is your message to the fighters and the people? to all the comrades who are fighting in trenches throughout the length and breadth of our country, I must say that the affection and admiration you have generated throughout the world, the solidarity with your struggle, and the surprising strength and heroism you have displayed are now receiving support from almost all of the countries of the world . Therefore, our struggle not only is not alone, but it has now achieved maximum support of all types: political, material, economic . solidarity has multiplied Hundredfold over the past few days, and it will be an inexhaustible source of support that will contribute to completing the Fascist regime's destruction . The people of the world admire the struggle the comrades and fighters in all the cities in this country are waging, and they very clearly understand that the struggle is for a just cause and against a completely illegitimate, Fascist, and criminal regime . The comrades can rest assured of this international support, which is currently very great . It is impressive to see all of the affection and admiration that our fighters are receiving from all over the world . Thank you very much, Salvador . Our greetings to all the other comrades . Thank you, . Thank you very much."
812,DEV-MUC3-0813,CLANDESTINE,1989-11-19,"Attention . We have reports that there is heavy fighting going on in the northern part of San Salvador and in Apopa . pay close attention . The Farabundo Marti National liberation front has intensified fighting against special battalions in San Salvador . We also report that during this fighting in San Salvador, at 1600 this afternoon, our anti-aircraft crews downed a Salvadoran Air Force helicopter . We hit the helicopter near Saquiro in Arce Street and it crashed . We are to receive more details and a report about the crew's fate later . We repeat, a Salvadoran Air Force helicopter was downed in San Salvador at 1600 today . This is the second helicopter we have downed in urban combat . at the beginning of our offensive we reported that a helicopter had been downed and one of its pilots had been killed."
813,DEV-MUC3-0814,CLANDESTINE,1989-11-19,"Comrade Salvador Samayoa, we have heard reports on statements by the U.S . Ambassador in San Salvador, William Walker, who said that despite the bombings his government, the Bush administration, will continue giving military aid and support to the Cristiani government . However, it seems the situation has changed following the assassination of the Jesuits . at this moment, how does the United States perceive the new situation in El Salvador? at the level of the U.S. people, there is a total repudiation of the Fascist criminal government and of the Salvadoran armed forces because of the bombings--which have become a true genocide--in various Densely populated cities and neighborhoods in El Salvador, as well as because of the assassinations perpetrated by the Salvadoran Army against the Jesuit priests at the central American university . There have been very radical demonstrations expressing much indignation by various U.S. social sectors . Moreover, in some of those demonstrations, the police barricades were broken . important U.S . political personalities such as Jesse Jackson, one of the most prestigious leaders in the United States, participated in the demonstrations . There have also been demonstrations in Boston, Chicago, New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles . in at least 20 cities in the United States people have expressed all their repudiation and indignation over the Cristiani government and the U.S. policy in El Salvador . Since the assassination of the Uca priests, a large number of important U.S . Senators and representatives are saying that U.S. military aid to the Salvadoran armed forces and government should be cut and suspended . Senator Kennedy in particular made a very strong statement, saying the Salvadoran armed forces' attitude simply expresses the failure of 10 years of U.S. policy--which has been spent feeding, training, arming, and financing an armed force that carries out assassinations . In addition to Senator Kennedy, there are many U.S . Senators and Congressmen who are requesting the total suspension of military aid to El Salvador . at this time, the Cristiani government and armed forces have the highest level of repudiation in the United States in the past 10 years . However, the U.S. government, the State Department, and the White House continue supporting the criminal regime and giving it further emergency aid . comrade, yesterday we learned about articles published in the main U.S. newspapers the New York Times and the Washington Post, which strongly question the government, specifically President Cristiani, the chief of the Fascist dictatorship . What is the situation of the Cristiani speech and his alleged legitimacy, not only in the United States but also at the level of the European Community? the alleged legitimacy of Cristiani collapsed . in the United States, they said Cristiani was had good intentions, but the right-wing and the death squads did not let him work . The speech failed because it is now clear that as Commander in chief of the armed forces, Cristiani is responsible for the genocide in San Salvador and other departments in the country . The media have also reported the arrest of U.S . religious men and of Swiss, French, Spanish, and Japanese citizens . The Salvadoran government is a government accusing everyone of cooperating with the guerrillas, and this has caused a total loss of the government's prestige . editorials on 18 November in the main U.S. newspapers Cristiani is not more than . At embassies and Consulates in most countries in Western Europe--in Italy, Spain, the Frg, France, Sweden, Denmark and everywhere--there have been demonstrations called by labor unions, political parties, and people's movements in those countries to express repudiation . in London, one of the most prestigious human rights organizations, amnesty International, urged everyone to stage demonstrations in front of all Salvadoran embassies and Consulates."
814,DEV-MUC3-0815,CLANDESTINE,,"The guerrilla offensive has not been defeated and cannot be defeated . International reports indicate that the revolutionary forces have become strong in the city, that they are making tactical movements, and that in spite of the Barbarism with which the armed forces has been operating, the guerrillas maintain all of their operational capabilities . The situation cannot defeat us . There must be a solution, and the Salvadoran people are increasingly, and in different ways, becoming involved in the revolutionary process to defeat the fascists and the Genocidal tactics they are using . We believe that what is happening is having an impact on international public opinion, and this undoubtedly will have an effect on the armed forces and could result in an effort to save the institution . We believe that in the armed forces there are officers and soldiers who reject Fascism . There have been many Desertions in the Army files . Many orders are being disobeyed, orders of a Genocidal nature usually . This is the starting point of an event that will Stun political opinion in El Salvador . We believe that if this savage killing of people does not stop, the military institution will be signing its own death sentence . The people cannot tolerate a military that functions under a most savage and Despotic regime, and the Cristiani government is in hot water, we could say . The revolutionary offensive, as I have noted, is being developed . We have solid positions in four of El Salvador's main cities, and as we have said before: no one is going to push us out . victory for democracy has been assured . the world will back us in the face of the savage genocide by the government forces, especially by the Fascist military elements in El Salvador . to conclude, commander, the funeral rites for the the priests who were murdered in San Salvador are taking place at this moment, around noon time, and Alfredo Cristiani and his wife are attending this ceremony . do you have any message for the Salvadoran people, for the students from the Catholic university, for the Christian people, for the people in general, who are mourning the death of these worthy Jesuits? we have already expressed, and I will reiterate it now, the deep sorrow of the Fmln Militants and the people in general over the loss of these worthy Jesuit priests who have been consistent Strugglers for democracy and peace in El Salvador . We share the feelings of the Salvadoran religious community . I would like to note that the presence of Cristiani at the burial for the Jesuit priests calls for a national and international outcry in demand for punishment for the persons responsible for this atrocious assassination . Cristiani cannot go to that burial and do nothing about people to whom he opened doors so that they could commit these killings . Everybody must demand that Cristiani respond to the people's indignation by punishing the persons responsible for the crime . Cristiani cannot speak about having moral authority for attending that burial unless he punishes the people who are responsible . It is not enough to punish the assassins . There must be a thorough investigation of the wave of crime that has been unleashed in El Salvador . The most notorious crime has been the killing of the Jesuit priests, but in the past 8 days many common people and community leaders have also been murdered . The bombing has been intense . The Salvadoran people are enduring much pain and they demand that the people responsible for it be punished . We again reiterate the pain of the people over the death of the Jesuit priests . We believe that the Catholic Church must bravely and loudly demand justice in the face of these crimes."

The Lutheran Bishop said that six Germans, four U.S. citizens, a Canadian, and a Spaniard were arrested by the Treasury police 2 days ago in a church in San Salvador, where the troops were looking for``guerrilla collaborators .""the foreigners were detained after having helped to aid civilians who took refuge in churches in San Salvador after fleeing from the bloody clashes between the military and rebels in the Mejicanos, Cuscatancingo, Zacamil, Ciudad Delgado, San Jacinto, and Soyapango neighborhoods, located in the northern and northeastern parts of the capital . Several priests, including Daniel Lopez, a Spaniard, had to evacuate their parishes, which are located in the embattled areas, after the churches were surrounded by soldiers . Lopez had to leave the Santa Maria de Los Pobres church in the La Chacra slum area in Eastern San Salvador after it was bombed by the Air Force, according to one of Lopez' assistants, who is also a Spaniard . religious sources told the press that Treasury policemen assaulted some 50 refugees in the San Roque shelter, located in Southern San Salvador, when they were searching for a priest named Cortez . The religious leaders said that the persecution was stepped up after the start of the guerrilla offensive in the capital, which began on 11 November and so far has left some 1,000 dead, including 6 Jesuit priests who were assassinated."

Armed Forces, do not fear the enemy . go forward with your resolve and spirit . Our faith in God and our Christian principles give us the truth and the strength to continue destroying the forces that are trying to wipe out our history, tradition, values, and citizens' principles . for each officer and soldier lost in the struggle, there is no other mission but to defeat the enemy, to destroy the terrorists' plans, and to once and for all wipe out this maneuver, this attempt to destroy the Institutionality of El Salvador . This is a timely occasion, Salvadoran people, to say that the armed forces as an institution at society's service deeply regret and have been dismayed by the incidents at the Jose Simeon Canas Central American university . We condemn, point at, and deeply reject these irrational and violent actions, which are aimed against Salvadoran intellectuals . We, like the Salvadoran people and the international community, also point to, question, and totally reject these actions which only bring mourning and grief and, Furthermore--as the terrorist forces have done on other occasions--create confusion, deceit, and further torment the Salvadoran people who have already suffered so much . The Armed Forces convey their deepest condolences to the national and international Jesuit community, and we are willing--as the government has pointed out--to carry out thorough investigations, so that sooner or later we will find those responsible for this situation and apply to them the punishment they deserve for such irrational, violent actions that only bring grief, tears, and blood to our Salvadoran people . Salvadoran people, I believe the time has come to further demonstrate our stoicism . I believe this is the time to define, in a true citizen's spirit, our resolve to defeat, our resolve to win . within a short while, a few hours, or a few days, we will join the Salvadoran people to celebrate the victory of democracy, justice, and peace over the irrational violence unleashed by the Fmln . This may also be a timely opportunity to point to the terrorist forces that are still trying to hurt our civilian population, to tell them that their cause, the cause of violence, irrationality, and disrespect for the people's will, is lost . to this effect, the armed forces are urging the terrorist forces to surrender, to lay down their weapons, to stop the violence, and to join civilian life in society, in peace and harmony, so that we also--as the armed forces and as an institution--can respect their lives and incorporate them into society, and so that together--today, tomorrow, and always--we can build a country full of love, Well- being, peace, and faith in God."

After 6 days of intense battles between the Army and the terrorist criminals of the Fmln, the Salvadoran armed forces have shown their professionalism by achieving total control in the capital . The locations where there were the biggest problems--the slopes of San Jacinto hill in the South and Soyapango, Ciudad Delgado, Mejicanos, and Zacamil--have been Retaken by the Army during the weekend . Even though the Army had dislodged the Marxist - Leninists from Mejicanos, civilian access to that area has not been permitted because the guerrillas mined the Entrances to several neighborhoods and several houses of people who did not cooperate with them . In Ciudad Delgado, armed forces soldiers fought small groups of guerrillas who had hidden in houses and who put up some resistance, which was quickly controlled by the armed forces . The Armed Forces maintain absolute control over Amatepec and Ciudad Credisa neighborhoods . onward brave soldiers . continue fighting to keep our Fatherland free with guarantees for all honest Salvadorans."
821,DEV-MUC3-0822,SAN SALVADOR,1989-11-20,"The Salvadoran capital, which has been the scene of fierce fighting between the Salvadoran Army and guerrillas over the past week, is slowly returning to normal . for the first time in 9 days many businesses and workplaces opened their doors and many buses were operating . After many days in which most vehicles on the streets were Ambulances, official or military vehicles, and vehicles belonging to newsmen, the capital awakened today to heavy traffic with buses, taxis, trucks, and private vehicles . The 24-hour``Curfew""decreed by the armed forces in the Densely populated neighborhoods of Ayutuxtepeque, Cuscatancingo, and Mejicanos in the Northwestern part of San Salvador was suspended, Salvadoran President Aflredo Cristiani announced on television last night . The``state of siege""and``Curfew ,""however, will remain in effect, from 1800 in the evening until 0600 in the morning . in two outlying neighborhoods of the capital, guerrilla Redoubts and soldiers have continued to clash, particularly in the neighborhoods of Apopa, Ciudad Delgado, and Soyapango . private vehicles cannot operate in much of Mejicanos neighborhood, one of the main guerrilla Bastions last week, as a result of the trenches dug by the rebels and debris piled on the streets from destroyed buildings and homes . The situation is also returning to normal in some parts of the Interior, except for some cities such as San Miguel in the East and Zacatecoluca in the South where there is still fierce fighting in which elite Army units are involved . in the capital city, the Red Cross and other Humantarian assistance organizations are beginning the tasks of cleaning up the rubble and rebuilding thousands of homes affected by the fighting and bombing, according to the preliminary assessments . International Red Cross sources said that some 50,000 persons have had to abandon their homes and are lodged in churches, Stadiums, schools, and other buildings set up as temporary lodgings . International emergency assistance has also begun to arrive bringing first aid for the many civilians who were wounded and are being treated in the hospitals where hundreds of the more than 1,000 who were treated last week remain, according to Salvadoran hospital sources . President Alfredo Cristiano reported on a radio and television network that``a few Redoubts""guerrilla Redoubts remain, that the armed forces have continued to advance, and that``the situation will be totally controlled soon .""he said that the war victims will be given economic assistance and that his cabinet will implement``reconstruction programs ,""with which he invited the private sector to cooperate . The state radio is celebrating the``defeat of the Red hordes""of the Farabundo Marti National liberation front in a tone of resounding victory, constantly rendering tribute to the leaders and soldiers of the battalions that have participated in expelling the guerrillas from the capital and other cities .``the terrorists fled in disarray ,""according to the state radio, which commented on the military situation that circles close to the Fmln interpreted as a``tactical withdrawal .""the fighting and bombings in the capital and other parts of the country have left a toll of more than 1,000 dead, hundreds wounded, and tens of thousands homeless."
822,DEV-MUC3-0823,CLANDESTINE,,"A friend of the Jesuit priests, the first to arrive on the scene, said that he counted some 500 or 600 bullet holes . He said that these shots were fired from some distance, with a machinegun set up on a tripod . The priests were also later shot in a garden nearby . According to information that the society of Jesus received following their own reconstruction of the crime, which they have released to the authorities investigating the case, the killers, approximately 30 men in uniform, arrived shortly before 0230 . They Machinegunned the house before entering, dragged the priests out, put them in front of a wall that is still stained with blood, and shot them . The priests were also shot in the head with a long-range weapon; however, these shots were fired from some distance . a lawyer, helping in the investigation of this case and who has asked to remain unidentified, said that this was determined because there were no gunpowder marks on the victims . at the time the crime was carried out, a Curfew was being observed throughout the city . and the house where the priests lived was surrounded by soldiers . together with this information, gathered by several institutions and prominent persons to prove that the murder was carried out by soldiers, we must stress that the house was also searched by the soldiers 2 days before the crime was committed . A Jesuit priest who was describing the scene said that only the area previously searched by the soldiers was destroyed . He said that the library was burned and the rooms had been ransacked . According to the priest, $5,000 that father Ignacio Ellacuria had received in Barcelona--part of an award given the University--were taken from one of the rooms . the use of long-range weapons would also explain why the brains of the dead were scattered about . This was seen by the first persons who arrived on the scene . others said that the bodies were destroyed because Ak-47 and M-16 assault rifles were used in the attack . The bodies were so utterly destroyed that Embalming was not possible . This was reported to Acan-Efe by society of Jesus superior Jose Maria Tojeira . regarding the two murdered women, the cook Elba Julia Ramos and her 15-year-old daughter Marisela, all indicates that they were Machinegunned in the small room where they slept . There was so much blood that it seeped under the door, and a Vertebra and pieces of a skull can still be seen under a sofa in the small room . The preliminary investigations seem to indicate that the victims were not tortured as earlier reports had stated . Meanwhile, Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani reportedly said yesterday that the armed forces high command has not ruled out the possibility that the killers of the six Jesuit priests could have been soldiers . They have not ruled out the possibility that soldiers could have killed the priests, and they are determined to investigate the incident and punish the responsible parties . This was said by the Salvadoran president in statements to Acan-Efe and other foreign news agencies . Cristiani, who insisted on the need to avoid unfounded conclusions, added that the military does not think it will be affected by something done by individual members of the institution . We can clearly see now that there are some contradictions . at this moment there are three positions . There is the position of U.S . Ambassador William Walker--he is like an Ostrich with its head buried in the sand . There is proof that rules out all doubt . How can 40 men in uniform be in a Militarized area for 60 minutes and not hear shots being fired and bombs exploding? Why did the Army not send in troops to find out what happened only a few blocks from Colonel Rene Emilio Ponce's office? the 40 men were in the area for a whole hour . They had already searched father Ellacuria's home . Our question for William Walker: if this was not done by the armed forces, then why were they there searching the premises for a whole hour and even stealing $5,000? they searched drawer by drawer . The disorder they left behind was quite evident in the clips shown on television . They searched the area for an hour to see what they, the murderers, could find to steal . However, Ambassador William Walker says that he does not know if the Army committed the crime."
823,DEV-MUC3-0824,CLANDESTINE,,"As we said earlier, there are three positions . This proves that there are contradictions surrounding this case . There is William Walker, acting like an Ostrich with his head stuck in the ground . and there is Cristiani's position--the death squad member who wears a tie, who after the international community, and who said that rash judgment should not be passed and that no one should be in a hurry to accuse the government or anyone else . and there is also the general staff and defense Ministry position blaming the Fmln . Why? If it is true that there is a civilian government in El Salvador, then why can the defense Minister appear before the television cameras Contradicting Cristiani, going against what Cristiani had said? who gives the orders here, Larios or Cristiani? If Cristiani gives the orders, then the defense Minister must obey Cristiani and refrain from making accusations before a serious investigation is held . However, this is not the case . This further proves what we have been saying . The civilian mask fell on Saturday . The defense Ministry holds the real power in the country . The defense Ministry censors the press . The soldiers are the ones Censoring the television stations, and not the arena followers or other civilians . The general staff, the soldiers, are gagging the press, imposing the state of siege, giving the final orders . It is important to look into this closely because Gen Larios, in an empty speech--we heard him deliver a Rhetorical and empty speech--accused the Fmln of killing the priests and said that the Army controls the country . We point out these contradictions . by saying that they did not do it, that the armed forces did not do it, the defense Minister admitted that he did it, that he is one of the killers . that is what Gen Larios is saying, that is what he said in his public statement . No doubt, and the international community has . We do not believe in the government's investigations because we have past examples of it . We have Monsignor Romero's case and we have the case of the revolutionary Democratic front leaders, who, a few years ago, were arrested in broad daylight during a police operation . However, not a single soldier has been punished . We do not believe in Cristiani's justice . The international community is putting on the pressure and Cristiani will have to do something . He will probably put up some act . The U.S. Congress also has its eyes on El Salvador . They are debating the issue of aid to El Salvador . There is something else the U.S. Congress must think about . The U.S. Department of state said that it is pleased with the way Cristiani acted in the face of the Fmln offensive . This means that the U.S. Department of state has approved the dropping of white phosphorus over Zacamil and the destruction of 500 homes . This means that the U.S. Department of state has approved the killing of the Jesuit priests, and also the massacre of several Salvadoran citizens who were taken from their homes and killed on the same black night when the Jesuit priests were killed."

The sources added that the circumstances surrounding Guillermo Rojas' death have yet to be clarified."
825,DEV-MUC3-0826,CLANDESTINE,1989-11-20,"Here is a very important point that U.S . Ambassador William Walker should take into consideration . Ambassador Walker seems to be a very bad investigator, as he is still in the dark as regards the cowardly murder of the Jesuit priests . after the funeral of the Jesuit priests, the U.S . Ambassador still expressed doubts regarding the authors of this crime . Well, we have received a report stating that the murderers of the Jesuits fired more than 500 shots and stayed in the residence of the Slain priests for 1 hour . In other words , 40 men in the uniform of the Salvadoran Army were a few blocks from the general staff participating in shooting that lasted several minutes, and remained in there for 1 hour, in an area under the Army's control, in an area under the control of the general staff . We have a question for the U.S . Ambassador . How could 40 men in Salvadoran armed forces uniforms, and with police and Army patrols only a few meters away from the Jesuits' residence, remain in that place for 1 hour if they were not members of the armed forces? Ambassador William Walker, if you still have any shame, tell the world and answer this question: if the armed forces general staff did not kill the Jesuit priests, how could the murderers--as this International dispatch says--remain in the residence for 1 hour after the heavy shooting, after killing the priests with Machineguns in tripods, as the Cable says? we will read this dispatch which is being read all over the world . Maybe William Walker does not even read International dispatches, because he cynically said after the priests' funeral that he had no evidence or indication that the crime was committed by the armed forces . Well, Ambassador William Walker, we will read this dispatch to you: the in uniform who killed six Jesuit priests and two companions in San Salvador on Thursday fired more than 500 shots and remained at the scene of the crime for almost 1 hour . We repeat: they were in the priests' residence for almost 1 hour, according to private investigations conducted by various institutions . a few hours before the funeral, the scene of the crime reveals some of the circumstances concerning the Machinegunning of the priests."

I consider it particularly important because the latest reports we are receiving state that the guerrillas are carrying out a tactical retreat, a tactical redeployment . I would like to ask you, Castro, what the objectives behind this tactical retreat or redeployment of the guerrilla movement are . [Castro) following 10 days of fighting in various places in the country, especially in San Salvador, where the regime conducted criminal bombings, going as far as using Phosphorous bombs, and to avoid further loss of civilian lives, that is, of people directly involved in the fighting, the Fmln has decided to carry out a tactical retreat in order to concentrate its forces to continue to strike in other places against the enemy: the Salvadoran Army . Castro, does this mean that the Political-Military maneuver has already ended? no . The Political-Military maneuver continues . The objective is to open areas for negotiations and, if possible, to create conditions that would be conducive to Dislodging that criminal government which is today making our people suffer . After nearly 10 days of fighting, does the Fmln consider that the operation has achieved its political objective? We believe that this operation has achieved several objectives . in the first place, we have shown the Salvadoran Army and the world our political, military and diplomatic capabilities . The enemy claimed that we are weak . They even stated that it would be impossible for the Fmln to hold a position in San Salvador for 1 day . We have held more than 10 positions for 10 days and they had to use all of the sophisticated weapons delivered to them by the U.S. government to force us to retreat, to carry out a tactical maneuver in order to avoid more deaths and to be able to continue to take actions in other areas of the country, including the capital itself . We are concerned about one thing: there is a group of guerrilla fighters, of rebel forces that are retreating from the capital . isn't the Salvadoran Army in a position to surround them, to annihilate them? no . It is impossible for the Army to surround or to annihilate our comrades . We have demonstrated our great maneuvering skills in the course of this war .

This is not right . is this is the democracy you people want to exist here? But you people are wrong, Mr. Walker . It will be impossible here because the people are a volcano in eruption . Whoever puts his hand in the fire will get burned, Mr. Walker . stop sticking your nose into someone else's business . You should rather send away, once and for all, those countrymen of yours who have been sent here as advisers . They are advisers, all right, but of the death squads . I have just one piece of advice for you . understand once and for all that Whoever puts his hand in the fire will get burned . The lava of this erupting volcano is boiling, Mr. Walker . understand that the people will not take one step back . all for peace . We have been reading the summary of our news monitoring . U.S. Pentagon military officials and many Nonmilitary analysts are surprised over what they call the Farabundo Marti National liberation front's offensive capabilities . a report States that Pentagon officials are very surprised over the Fmln maneuverability and offensive capabilities . The Fmln actions of the past days has spoiled all the intelligence reports that Salvadoran military men sent to U.S. officials containing information on the Fmln Manpower-Weapons ratio and our military ability to operate . The Fmln has never lost its military capabilities . Some analysts view the Salvadoran war as a war between two armies . that is a mistake because the Salvadoran war is not a war between two armies . It cannot be viewed as if it were a regular war such as the Iran-Iraq war . El Salvador is living through conflict that is mainly social in nature, a conflict that is rooted in social injustice . The Fmln did not emerge from a military school with a rearguard in another country, but it is made up of the people themselves . Fmln combatants have learned to fight in actual clashes . They have gained ground inch by inch; it has organized the people . The Fmln does not forcefully recruit people . Therefore, it is not periodically renewing its ranks as the Army does through forceful recruitment . to the Fmln, the main goal is to organize the people, to get as close as it can to the people . because of the economic crisis, social injustice, and lack of democratic opportunities in Salvador, thousands of Salvadorans have no other option than to take up arms and fight to achieve better living conditions in the face of the government's brutal repression, economic injustice, and unemployment . to change this situation, thousands of Salvadorans decided to take up arms and learn to wage war by fighting Daiily . that is the history of the Fmln . Therefore, it cannot be said that two armies are fighting each other . The logistics apparatus of the Fascist government' forces is not comparable to our forces . They bring to our country tons of bombs, rifles, boots, and material through ports and military airports . Although the governments of Nicaragua, Cuba, and the USSR could help the Fmln, as many are saying, the firepower of our forces could never be compared to the Army's . Nevertheless, the Fmln has opened in all countries, including the States, the necessary ways for us to obtain our arms and ammunition . We have the right to this . How does the Fmln learn to fight--by fighting . We are now fighting in cities . Every military analyst knows how difficult it is to fight in urban areas . The Fmln fighting in San Salvador, San Miguel, Zacatecoluca, and Usulutan has shown the organization's tremendous ability to wear out the enemy, take and hold positions, and maneuver in the city just as it has done in rural areas . The Fmln ability has surprised the military analysts at the Pentagon . Our front has always had this ability . But now we have changed our strategy and tactics to defeat the enemy plans . The forces have a specific plan regarding the actions by patrols, special operations . The Fmln had to change its strategy to strike at the small forces that tried to infiltrate our zone under cover . only thus could we annihilate and defeat these forces and their strategy . and this is what we did . This is what must be observed, how the Fmln has changed its military strategy to face the one used by the forces . of course, we have accumulated great experience over the years, which we have applied these last days in combat in Salvador and Miguel . armored personnel carriers are being destroyed in streets and avenues; helicopters are being shot down; soldiers are being taken prisoner; and arms are being seized . military analysts are wondering how a guerrilla Army can operate for so long in an urban area . In addition, logistics must be taken into consideration . The forces are constantly getting ammunition through the Ilopango base . The Fmln has been able to carry out this operation because of the people's support . thousands of capital residents cooperated by keeping silent when they saw the guerrilla columns pass by . They did not warn the forces . Why? because the people see in these guerrilla columns their own Army."

In this way, Gen Bustillo replied to statements by San Salvador Archbishop Arturo Rivera Y Damas, who said the Army's response to the Fmln offensive in San Salvador was excessive . Many comments can be made but what must be asked is why did the rebels seek the urban areas? What is their justification? that is the Condemnable aspect . The Salvadoran people and the media should not be confused about whether we acted strongly as Msgr Rivera Y Damas said . It is true we have been strong and we will continue to be strong . But we must understand that the terrorists began the action, that is how the problem began . that is what must be judged and not how we reacted . Gen Bustillo said the main role of the Air force is the defense of the Fatherland . He added: there is no room here for guerrillas and much less for those of the Fmln who call themselves defenders of the people . Gen Bustillo said this Fmln offensive was not prepared in the last few days . Instead, he said, it must have been prepared at least 18 months ago . He said it has taken time to oust the rebels because the armed forces have not wanted to harm the civilian population, among which the insurgents hid . It is difficult for us to annihilate these terrorists when they take people as hostages . that is why for years they began infiltrating and establishing the means to use the people as a cover . We can see that what they have been doing in the mountains and the villages for the past 9 years, they have now carried out here in San Salvador and other big cities . They have taken cover behind the people, and that is why it has been very hard and difficult for us to annihilate them . We had to be careful so as to cause the least harm to the people . He also said the seizure of the Sheraton hotel is an isolated incident that only SEEKS international attention . Bustillo said a negotiated solution has just been a game for the rebels so no one in El Salvador should consider it as a solution to a 10-year-old war that has left more than 60,000 dead . The dialogue and a negotiated solution have been a tactic used by the Fmln for several years . We can now clearly see that neither the people, armed forces, nor the politicians should consider them as an alternative . It can be clearly seen that all this time during which some individuals of this administration and the previous administration had been seeking a solution through dialogue, the Fmln had just been preparing for this offensive . Asked what plans the armed forces have in the face of another Fmln offensive, the general was emphatic: annihilate them . annihilate them . that is the only thing we can do . The general made these statements to this newscast after he listed the weapons that were seized and the casualties sustained by the Army . Bustillo said four officers of the paratroopers Battalion were killed and several were wounded . He said 20 soldiers died in the military actions."

The only thing the Fmln has managed to achieve is to earn the Salvadoran people's scorn .""`` We want to talk about a cease-fire and negotiate a cease-fire but we believe that the ending of hostilities should be the first gesture because that is the only way we can talk to the Fmln . If this does not occur, I do not think that one single Salvadoran will trust the Fmln in the least . We, meaning the armed forces and the government of the Republic, do not want to .""the President said that there is a possibility that the Curfew will be modified, particularly in places where order has been completely restored . He also explained that his government has never sought a military solution to the armed conflict because that is clarified in the Constitution . Cristiani``We have never sought a military solution . The Fmln is the one which has opted for a military solution . We have not government of the Republic with weapons and we have not sought the armed forces to do it . The Fmln is the only one trying to seize power with its weapons . The Armed Forces has only fulfilled its duty, which is to counter an armed action .""`` Furthermore, we believe that this aggression is Nicaragua and Cuba, because Nicaragua and Cuba the Fmln would have no possibility of peace in El Salvador .""the President asserted that his government will continue with the dialogue process but it must be fully convinced that the Rebel groups are willing to put down their weapons and join the democratic process in a peaceful and voluntary way . He explained that the government's role in Caracas, Venezuela, was limited to notifying his counterpart, Carlos Andres Perez, about the Salvadoran situation and reasserting the government's position given the Fmln delegation's absence--which confirmed their lack of willingness to achieve peace."

Well, we would like to ask William Walker--who has said in the United States that the Fmln peace proposals are not feasible because they violate the Salvadoran Constitution--if the Constitution does not prohibit foreign troops from coming to our country without the government's approval? we would like to ask the Cristiani government and the legislative assembly why U.S. Army special forces came to El Salvador, as President Bush himself announced? we saw these special forces in the streets of San Salvador, violating the Constitution that you people claim to defend . We want to ask the patriotic officials: Why are there three armies right now in this country? there is the Fmln Army, the La Tandona Army, and President Bush's Army . So, what is the answer? whenever we propose a political solution to the conflict, we are told it is impossible because it violates the Constitution . However, President Bush violated the Constitution that the government and the legislative assembly claim to defend when he sent a foreign military force to this country . He also violated the sovereignty of this nation . Therefore, gentlemen of arena and of the high command, this love for the Constitution and the laws that you claim to have is false . We want to ask Colonel Ponce: why is there a foreign military force in our country right now? doesn't the Constitution that your armed forces claim to respect prohibit it? in other words, when the nation wants a political solution for the sake of peace, you people say it is impossible because we must respect the Constitution . However, when President Bush arrogantly ANNOUNCES in his Presidential plane that his forces have carried out operations in a San Salvador hotel, then the Constitution is worth nothing . We want to appeal to the armed forces officers to think about this situation . There are officers being killed on the battlefields . for example, an officer from the Morazan Battalion died in Altos de la Cueva in San Miguel; lieutenants have been killed in San Salvador city; dozens of lieutenants have been wounded or killed in the last 10 days . officers, you know about this . So we want to call on the lieutenants, the captains, the patriotic officers, to think about this situation . You are being told you are defending the Constitution . What Constitution? after all, a herd of Gringo Rambos is here; and with their Yankee boots, they have trampled on the Constitution . So officers, what are you defending? What do you think about this? this situation is unacceptable for any Salvadoran Patriot . officers, we know you are listening to us in the Garrisons to find out what is happening, because the government network is hiding this information from you . You must think over this situation, officers . You are shedding blood, losing arms and legs in the battlefields, sacrificing your lives, seeing how the capital city is being destroyed by the bombings, and you are told this is being done to defend the Constitution . However, Mr Bush decided to send a herd of Rambos who are good for nothing . After all, they did nothing, except cover their faces like common criminals . So, officers, what are you fighting for? What is at stake here? is it communism, or this or that? is it because Msgr Romero was a Communist and therefore murdered? was it because the Jesuits were Communists and therefore murdered? Now it is said that the Christian Democratic party members are Communists . others say that the journalists, the teachers are Communists; everyone is a Communist . is this a nation of Communists? What is this? we must start to think about this situation at this critical hour for the nation."

The text of the note reads . NOTE no . 122-Dsm Tegucigalpa , 23 November 1989 his Excellency Mr Miguel D'Escoto Brockmann foreign minister Managua, Nicaragua Mr Minister: my government has noted with great concern the concentration of Nicaraguan troops at various points of the border with Honduras, as well as the announcements made by Nicaraguan government spokesmen about beginning military actions against their armed opposition, regardless of location . taking into consideration the danger represented by the concentration of troops at the border, my government hereby warns that it is a violation of international law, particularly to Inter-American law, to resort to threats or the use of force and to violate the Soverignty and territorial integrity of other states . As your government is fully aware of--and this has been verified by on-site inspections by the International Commission of support and verification--approximately 15,000 Hondurans live in the border sector currently threatened by the Sandinist people's Army and artillery . the security of those citizens is the primary responsibility of my government . However, in that sector there are camps of disarmed former combatants from the Nicaraguan resistance . Many of them are war crippled and their relatives, most of whom are children, women, and the elderly . to carry out indiscriminate bombings against the Honduran civilian population and to violate that sector of Honduran territory would be a barbaric action against humanity . If you are referring to an alleged right to Cary out military actions against your armed opposition``no matter where they are ,""I remind you that this would be an intentional massacre, because most of the people in that area are civilians and the rest are disarmed former combatants . This situation has been verified by the Ciav . Therefore, my government demands the immediate withdrawal of the Nicaraguan troops concentrated in the border areas with Honduras . up until this time, the Honduran government has not increased the number of troops who regularly compose the border security forces . Nevertheless, my government is not giving up its right to repel any action that violates Honduran sovereignty and territorial integrity and to carry out the consultations it deems necessary, to adopt the individual or collective defense measures the situation requires . My government also wants to state that it views with astonishment the proposal presented by the Nicaraguan government to the Counterrevolution--during the talks promoted by the Ciav in the United States--in the sense that the Nicaraguan internal armed conflict be solved by withdrawing the armed opposition to Honduras . This proposal clearly violates the Esquipulas II agreement and the agreements signed at the Tela summit, which contain provisions for democratization, national reconciliation, demobilization, and repatriation."

865,DEV-MUC3-0866,SEOUL ,1989-11-22,"At a time when the world's attention is Riveted on the democratization movement in Eastern Europe, we hear a gloomy news report that the protracted Civil War between El Salvador's governmental troops receiving U.S. assistance and leftist guerrillas has recently once again intensified, and has taken many lives . The Soviet Union is now prodding the countries in Eastern Europe, which were once known as Soviet satellites, to democratize and to reform their state systems; why does the United States increase its military aid to El Salvador and cause the Civil War to intensify? like many central and South American countries before they became democratized, the political and economic situation in El Salvador is such that it is plagued by an extreme form of the gap between rich and poor, by military dictatorship, by right-wing terrorism, and by abuse of human rights to the point where it could be engulfed by revolution at any time . How can a country where more than 2.5 million out of a population of 5.4 million are on the border of starvation, and where roughly 20 percent of the population enjoys 66 percent of the country's gross national product, be in peace? after a large-scale peasant uprising in 1930, the leftist forces in this country formed a unified guerrilla organization in 1980 and began the armed struggle in earnest . The Oligarchic ruling class, which is said to consist of 15 to 240 families with high income, launched a``clean-up operation""against guerrillas in collusion with the military, and openly massacred the leaders of workers and peasants by organizing an extreme right-wing assassination group called the``death squad .""they even went so far as to assassinate intellectuals and clergymen who championed social reform and human rights . films such as``Romero""and``Salvador""that have been shown in our country in recent months are clear evidence of the brutality committed by such an assassination group . This group was unquestionably behind the recent assassinations in which 10 labor union leaders were mercilessly massacred and another 8, including a Jesuit priest, were brutally killed . The problem is that the United States lurks behind the military and right-wing forces that are bent on suppressing those who call for social reform and respect human rights, not stopping at a``cleaning up""of the leftist guerrillas . While sending a group of military advisers to El Salvador to help the government troops mop up the guerrillas, the United States is now also supplying the country with weapons, including assault helicopters, worth U.S. $103 million . How long will the United States retain its old policy of ignoring social reform and democratization in a neighboring country and of giving military aid to its incompetent government in order to defend its own interests? with our eyes on the democratization movement in East Europe, we are compelled to think once again of the democratization in central and South America, and of the outside intervention there blocking the democratic process . drawing a lesson from the defeat it suffered in Vietnam and in Iran, the United States should cease interfering in the internal affairs of other countries."

We are informing the national and international community that such bombings have yielded thousands of refugees and destroyed thousands of homes belonging to humble families in San Salvador, San Miguel, Usulutan, and Zacatecoluca . In rejecting a cease-fire, the government has turned its back on the international community . 2 . that in view of the rumors that the Fmln is planning to attack U.S. citizens to not attack U.S . personnel and installations . that policy was evident during the Sheraton hotel incident in which, although our forces enjoyed an advantage over the green Berets trapped in that hotel, and despite the prevailing tension, they rigorously adhered to that policy with discipline . 3 .

We can no longer continue doing nothing in view of this Genocidal, Interventionist action, and more than anything, a traitorous action by Daniel Ortega . that is why we resolved on 25 November, Salvadoran people, to make the proper charges against Ortega and his government before the UN Security Council and the OAS Security Council . Second, we will suspend relations, be they diplomatic, commercial, or of any sort with Nicaragua . We will withdraw our mission from Nicaragua . Third, at the next Presidential summit, El Salvador will not go to Nicaragua . right now, it will ask the other three Democratic Presidents of the area to transfer the site of that meeting to another Fraternal Central American country . We will demand there, before the central American countries that they truly honor the Esquipulas pact and condemn Daniel Ortega for supporting the Fmln we can appreciate, very frankly, what the Fmln is . They are nothing more than the puppets of the Communist aggression . Mr Castro and Mr Ortega are resisting all of the changes that are taking place in the Soviet Union and in all of the countries behind the iron curtain which are attempting to democratize themselves and give their people liberty . They are the only two who seek to continue to remain in power through the rifle and by war . Salvadoran people, we cannot permit our country, our small El Salvador, or our noble Salvadoran people to be the victims of that Communist aggression which Daniel Ortega and Fidel Castro seek to launch . in that sense, Salvadoran people, in view of this new situation, we want you to reflect on that artificial cease-fire which the Fmln launched a few days ago . What is the Fmln up to with that cease-fire? it made that proposal after it was removed from the city that it had attacked . The people were resuming their normal activities and everything was under the control of the armed forces in those areas . Why did they call for a cease-fire when they had already been defeated in the offensive by the Salvadoran people who had repudiated their terrorist actions? they had no real objective ahead, other than to continue to destroy, to assassinate, and to continue to generate terrorist actions here in our country . Therefore, the Salvadoran government cannot permit itself to fall into another trap of the Fmln . If they went to Mexico and Costa Rica with a sincere desire for peace, as they tried to make us believe, we realize today that those actions were just another farce . This aggression was not planned in 2 or 3 days . This aggression had been planned several months back . knowing that they were going to attack the Salvadoran people, they had the gall to attend and make the entire world believe that they really wanted peace . Therefore, we cannot, I repeat Salvadoran people, fall into another trap of the Fmln . They have no right to demand territorial rights in our country when they are a band of terrorists and are puppets of Ortega and Castro . Let us see if the people who receive support, as they are, will owe Ortega and Castro favors . If they succeed, they will owe loyalty not to the Salvadoran people, but to Communist dictators such as Daniel Ortega and Fidel Castro . that is why the government has Establsihed a clear position."

How could I welcome in Nicaragua the representative of a government that kills priests and bishops, that killed Monsignor Romero; a government that kills clergymen, that has killed nuns and members of other churches, Catholics and evangelists; a government that kills workers, peasants, laborers, and leaders of political parties, that has killed more than 600 Christian Democratic party leaders . They were killed by arena, the ruling party in El Salvador, and the Salvadoran Army, which is the same thing . I kept asking myself: How can I welcome them in Nicaragua? it would be like welcoming Somoza . All I could come up with was to find an excuse not to hold the meeting . It would have been terrible for the Nicaraguan people to have to welcome and have as a guest the representative of a government that kills priests, nuns, workers, laborers, peasants, intellectuals, professionals, and workers . Therefore, this news made me happy . It made me happy because we have avoided the problem of having to welcome, in Nicaragua, the President of that government of international killers and common criminals . The truth is that we should feel proud . as a Nicaraguan I feel proud that that murderous government has broken relations with Nicaragua . that is something to be proud of, because it means that they know perfectly well that we are on the side of the Salvadoran people, on the side of the Salvadoran peasant, on the side of the Salvadoran worker, on the side of the Salvadoran church and priests, that we are on the side of peace, justice, and democracy in El Salvador, and that we oppose tyranny in El Salvador . I can see that the time has come for me to speak clearly to you . I believe that it is necessary to speak clearly because diplomatic jargon can sometimes confuse things . It is time that we speak clearly . the least the Nicaraguan government can do in response to the attitude assumed by the Salvadoran government is to ask and demand of the international community and the world that it break relations with that murderous and criminal government until those who killed the priests have been punished, until those who are killing the Salvadoran people have been punished . that is what we are going to demand . that is going to be our answer . The international community is uneasy because of what is happening in El Salvador . Cristiani is no tame dove . He has become an accomplice and instrument of this policy of death implemented by the Army, by men like Ponce and Bustillo . They are murderous Guardsmen just like those you knew, the Somozist Guardsmen . Bustillo, Ponce, and a few others are just like that . However, not all of them are like that . There are some honest soldiers in El Salvador, soldiers with honest positions."
877,DEV-MUC3-0878,CLANDESTINE,1989-11-26,"A few days after the start of the Fmln offensive, the results are completely positive . First of all, we are seeing the total political defeat of the democracy and Counterinsurgency plan because the Cristiani government has been unmasked as a Fascist dictatorship . The U.S. Counterinsurgency model tried to Legitimize, through an electoral process, a quote, democratic, Unquote, government which would leave the growing popular insurgency in El Salvador with no reason to exist . that model has overwhelmingly failed because, instead of an even timidly democratic government, what has been installed is a regime that does not even tolerate the Christian Democratic party, which it views as a great traitor to the Fatherland . a regime has been established which does not permit the most minimal opportunities for the free expression of thought . It does not tolerate the existence of an objective and independent newscast, such as that of television Canal Doce . It is a regime which demands that the highest leaders of the church leave the country because it does not guarantee their security . It is a regime that issues totally undemocratic laws and closes all political opportunities . In short, it is a regime in a state of emergency . It is a Fascist regime with all its components . that is the final result of the U.S. efforts to establish a Counterinsurgent Democratic regime in El Salvador . The little legitimacy that the Cristiani government at one point enjoyed was destroyed when it had to cover up and permit the assassination of six Jesuit priests to go unpunished, and when it Indiscriminately bombed the more Densely populated areas of the country . a few days of the offensive have been enough to tear down the foundations of the erroneous U.S. policy in our country . and the validity of that policy has begun to be seriously questioned in the United States . a second great achievement of these first weeks of the offensive has been a radical change in the theaters of operation . We have placed the war in its final phase, in its phase of strategic definition . There has been an abrupt change in what had appeared to be an endless war and an unbreakable balance of forces . The transfer of the theaters of operation to the cities has resulted in a strategic siege of the cities, which are the weak spots of the political, economic, and social power . in turn, as we have previously pointed out, this has brought about an accelerated political breakdown of the regime."
878,DEV-MUC3-0879,CLANDESTINE,,"The enemy is left like that, hanging from a thread--a strategic thread which can break at any moment and result in a military setback for the Army . The phenomenon which ensued after the masses joined the offensive in its early stages forced the enemy to Indiscriminately use the Air force to prevent a general uprising and to curtail the insurrection . Nevertheless, the effort exerted to launch a nationwide offensive has been based on a large-scale peasant and suburban insurrection process . Our ranks were considerably increased to render the offensive effective, and this was possible thanks to the people's great interest in fighting in the cities and speeding up the outcome of the war . The people also joined our ranks during the fighting which occurred in the cities . Furthermore, the germ of a new social explosion has been created by the government itself, with its indiscriminate bombings and repression . Even though some people may blame the Fmln for the Army's brutal reaction, few can feel any sympathy for those who have bombed them . This has created a social situation which guarantees the continuity of the Fmln's offensive until victory is achieved . all the people displaced by the bombings are dissatisfied people who will join the struggle sooner or later . We remember the phenomenon of the displaced people and refugees caused by the bombings in the Salvadoran countryside . The brutal attitude of the Army and Air Force has legitimized the armed struggle . The other party, meaning the enemy, had to grab all the resources of a conventional war: airplanes, helicopters, and heavy artillery . This Legitimizes the people's armed struggle and self-defense . a third great achievement of the national and strategic effort exerted against fascism has been the liberation of large zones of the National territory . a new, emerging power now controls eight departments of the country . The Army is spread thin and it had to abandon the zones where it cannot keep its men--compromised as it is in the Strategic defense of the cities . This puts the Army throughout the National territory in a situation resembling a cloth with many holes, stretched to the limit and threatening to rip at any point . The tear can occur when least expected . large groups of people are now in those liberated territories, engaged in a reconstruction effort and organizing a rearguard for the March on the cities . There is a fourth element to consider: one of the first and most important achievements is the fact that there is now a better balance for negotiations . all of the government's demands and proposals at the negotiation table are completely null and void . The pretense of demanding the Fmln's surrender is untimely given such a show of strength . No one in the world would now be willing to bet on that position."
879,DEV-MUC3-0880,CLANDESTINE,,"There is no longer room for the idea of dialogue without negotiation . Now we must negotiate in earnest . that demand has been made by several governments and international forums, and even by some influential sectors in the United States . Yet Cristiani has opposed this universal current . Cristiani's tactical, propagandistic, and delaying moves around the negotiations table will no longer have a chance to succeed . on the other hand, it will now be an indispensable condition that dialogue and negotiation be expanded and that the real Decisionmakers be the ones who sit at the negotiating table . Finally, following the offensive launched by the Fmln, the analysts, especially in the United States, have admitted that there is a need to carry out an in-depth study of the value of the U.S. government's policy toward El Salvador . The debate on the conditioning, and even the total suspension, of military aid to the Salvadoran Army is very intense, and it has already shaken the foundations of bipartisanship regarding U.S. support for the Cristiani government . You will recall that the debate has not continued because the U.S. Congress has declared a Recess; however, it will soon become the center of the U.S. Congress' debates . In summary, we could say that the enemy has lost ground and legitimacy, and the basis for its support, the U.S. aid, is being seriously threatened . In addition, the Army has been reduced to the Strategic defense of an important center, the capital city . Therefore, it is only logical to say that today we saw a very worried, even desperate, Cristiani . Cristiani's speech on the radio and television network shows an attempt to Retouch the picture . Cristiani tried to lower the level of the water that has reached his neck by diverting the world's attention from the bombings and the deaths of the Jesuit priests to Nicaragua . In this desperate effort, all that Cristiani has done is to take the war to other and more dangerous levels . He is attempting to Regionalize the war, and this will undoubtedly isolate him even more from the world . The outcome of this situation depends on all these factors that can accelerate the decomposition of fascism in the country . However, they depend mostly on the vigor and strength that all the Salvadoran people place on this ongoing and irreversible struggle."

Aeronautic authorities reported that a plane with registration number Hk-1803 traveling from Bogota to CALI took off at 07:13 from the Bogota airport . a few minutes later, witnesses reported to Bogota radio stations that the plane exploded in the air, broke in two, and burst into flames . Octavio Fonseca, a witness who was near where the plane fell told Cadena radial Colombiana that``the plane exploded in the air and broke in two .""he added:``I have already gone to where the plane fell .

881,DEV-MUC3-0882,CLANDESTINE,1989-11-27,"Attention . pay close attention . attention . pay close attention . As we have already reported, U.S. officials, important persons, and politicians in the United States have issued statements affirming that the Salvadoran armed forces are directly linked to the case of the murdered Jesuits . The testimony given by the lady who witnessed the central American University crime has caused political upheaval that is also being felt in the corridors of the U.S. Congress, the White House, and the Pentagon . Even Elliott Abrams, former assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American affairs, has stated on the face the nation television program on 27 November, that the murder of the six Jesuits, a woman, and her daughter was an action by the Salvadoran armed forces and not the Fmln . Abrams, a former Reagan administration official, stated: based on 10 years experience on the Salvadoran conflict, I presume that the death of the priests was not the work of leftist guerrillas, but an action by forces of the Cristiani administration . We do not have a record of guerrillas taking this sort of action, said Elliot Abrams . He added that, in the past, many military officers have been associated with the so-called death squads and the rightist sector in El Salvador . These were the statements by Elliot Abrams . VOA has reported the statements by the woman who witnessed the crime . at this time in the United States, the Salvadoran top military command, Colonel Rene Emilio Ponce, and President Alfredo Cristiani are being pointed out as the persons directly responsible for this Abominable crime . in relation to this, we want to denounce the following to the international community, the people of the United States, and the International media . over the past few hours, the Cristiani administration has tried to divert the attention of the United States that is presently centered on the case of the murdered Jesuits and the involvement of the Salvadoran government in this crime . We denounce the arrest of U.S. citizen Jennifer Cazolo as part of a Salvadoran armed forces plan to attempt to divert the attention of international public opinion from the Jesuits' case . We also denounce the arrest of Jennifer Cazolo as a repressive act . Also, the armed forces is trying to link humanitarian aid for El Salvador, human rights, and U.S.-Based organizations to the Fmln . It is trying to link these organizations and these persons to the Fmln . The Fmln completely denies that it has any link with U.S. citizen Jennifer Cazolo . We denounce this accusation as a clumsy set up by the armed forces command, which is trying--we repeat--trying to repress these humanitarian organizations and foreigners . This is a set up by the armed forces to repress foreign citizens and--we repeat--it is a smoke screen to divert U.S . attention from the case that is presently on the table . It is a set up to not attend the international community's demand for justice in the case of the Jesuit priests . If Elliot Abrams, former Secretary of State for Inter-American affairs, who knows so much about El Salvador, says that it was not the Fmln and that the crime was committed by military units and persons linked to the Cristiani administration, his statements will have strong repercussions in the United States . The Armed Forces command and the Cristiani Administration are trying to do all they can to throw a smokescreen here and there to try to divert the attention of the international community and, especially, the people of the United States . In conclusion, we Reafirm: We deny the armed forces' accusations against U.S. citizen Jennifer Cazolo . We state that the accusation is a clumsy set up to hide and not respond to the question everyone is asking--where are the murderers of the Jesuits? behind the clumsy set up with regard to the U.S. citizen, we also see that they intend to continue to repress humanitarian organizations and different sectors that have expressed solidarity with El Salvador . In short, all this set up attempts to do is throw a huge smokescreen to repress these organizations and foreigners."

Ernani Valda, the director of the radio station, has reported that so far the damage is estimated at 2.5 million pesos . The bomb was placed in the office of political commentator German Gamonal, who is also the press director . five people were working at the offices when the explosion occurred; one of them was injured . We spoke with reporter Hermogenes Carrillo, who arrived at the radio station offices after the attack . One person suffered minor injuries and the offices of radio Mineria were substantially damaged during the bomb attack here at the intersection of Providencia and Tobalaba streets this morning at 0510 . The radio station was off the air for 45 minutes, during which time Carabineros personnel inspected the site to confirm that there were no other bombs . Gope personnel arrived later . According to their specialized personnel the bomb contained Tronex, and it had been placed by one of the windows on Providencia street . at least two or three people were involved in the attack . They somehow climbed to the second floor, placed the bomb, lit the fuse, and fled . No warning was received nor has any subversive movement claimed responsibility for this attack so far . We have received telephone calls from our listeners across the country . We have also received important political personalities, including presidential candidate Hernan Buchi and interior Minister Carlos Caceres . Among others, we have received a call from Osorno from Francisco Javier Errazuriz and another call from Santiago from Ricardo Lagos . This is all we can report for now .

883,DEV-MUC3-0884,BOGOTA,1989-11-27,"Police sources have described the Annonymous telephone call to radio Cadena Caracol blaming``the Extraditables""drug trafficking group for the explosion on board an Avianca Boeing 727 as``lacking credibility .""the plane was on a flight from Bogota to CALI with 107 persons aboard . The Annonymous caller said that``the Extraditables""had planted a bomb on that plane because``five Informers""were aboard . However, police sources consulted by Efe were skeptical, describing what the Annonymous caller had said as lacking credibility . Another police source told Efe that the Annonymous phone call blaming``the Extraditables""for the explosion sounded more like a joke in bad taste . He added that the call does not follow the normal pattern used by that group when claiming responsibility for its actions . The group usually sends communiques to the media . These communiques are written on paper with the group's letterhead and are duly signed, and at times include the fingerprints of those responsible for sending the communique . A spokesperson at El Dorado International Airport in Bogota, from where the plane took off, said that it was practically impossible for someone to have evaded the strict security at the airport . The source added that the passengers and the luggage underwent routine but rigorous security checks . These security checks include hand checks and the use of electronic equipment and Explosives-Detecting dogs . The source added that nothing unusual was noticed .``the Extraditables""is an armed group under the Medellin cartel that for the past 6 years has been fighting against the Extradition of COLOMBIANS to the United States . up to now the crimes that the group has claimed responsibility for, and others for which it is blamed, have all fallen under the category of selective murders but never an indiscriminate attack like destroying a plane . Civil Aeronautics directorate sources said that the black box has been found and that its contents will probably reveal what happened . The sources added that 8 hours after the tragedy, there are still no clues that would allow them to be absolutely sure whether this was an attack or an accident . Most of the passengers on board the plane were government and private businessmen who were traveling from Bogota to CALI, in the southeastern sector of the country, for business purposes."
884,DEV-MUC3-0885,MANAGUA ,1989-11-27,"The alleged Nicaraguan pilot that was killed in El Salvador is alive and well, in Managua, talking with us . The Salvadoran government said Mauricio Quiros Garcia was killed in an alleged transshipment of weapons last Saturday , 25 November when a Cessna plane crashed . Mauricio Quiros Garcia , 36-Years-Old, is here, next to me . He is married and has children . good evening, Mauricio . good evening . I am so surprised and astonished over this report, that I really do not know how to explain how I felt when I was called . At first, I thought it was a joke . However, after receiving several telephone calls from several newsmen, I started to think seriously about this . I want to clarify and explain that this report is totally false . Mauricio, the Salvadoran government says you are a former pilot of the Sandinist Air Force, FAS . is that true? that is true . I was in the FAS for 2 years, and now, I have been working with Aeronica for the last 8 years . What types of flights do you make? to where do you fly and from where? they are international flights . I am the captain of a Boeing 727 . We fly to Panama City; San Jose, Costa Rica; Mexico city, and Guatemala city . Where did you go to school? in Mexico . were you ever involved with the Fmln, are you familiar with any type of weapons? the reports mention sophisticated equipment . did you just unload all that in El Salvador, and turned around so quickly, that you were in several places on Saturday? I do not have the slightest notion about sophisticated weapons, or anything else . My job is to pilot a plane, and that is what I do; I pilot the Aeronica plane and that is it . Mauricio, do you know the Fmln well? no, I do not know anyone from the Fmln . I have no relations with anyone linked at all to the Fmln . So why should anyone want to report that you were killed early in the morning in Usulutan Department? well, as I said before, that report has surprised me . frankly speaking, I do not know . This shows that certain governments sometimes issue totally false reports in order to hide or, I do not know that report is totally false . that is all I can say . As you can see, I am very concerned, and just as surprised as you are."
885,DEV-MUC3-0886,MANAGUA ,1989-11-27,"El Salvador has carried out a constant and permanent aggression against Nicaragua and Nicaragua has never suggested breaking relations with El Salvador . Nicaragua has not even thought about breaking relations with Honduras . on the contrary, we have always tried to follow a policy of negotiations to solve problems . I do not believe in fooling ourselves . The real problem here is that the central American Presidents made a commitment, and that commitment must be fulfilled . The central American Presidents made a commitment to mobilize the Contras; that commitment must be fulfilled . The central American Presidents also committed themselves to respecting human rights in Central America, and that commitment must also be fulfilled . El Salvador must fulfill that commitment . The Salvadoran government is not respecting human rights in El Salvador, they are killing people in El Salvador, they have bombed the Salvadoran people and they have killed the Jesuit priests . In light of all this, the Nicaraguan government must express its solidarity with the Salvadoran people; the Salvadoran people are the ones who are suffering . We cannot be in solidarity with an Army that is killing the Salvadoran people . Let us wait and see how many governments will support that Army which is killing the Salvadoran people, an Army that is bombing the Salvadoran people, an Army that has killed the Jesuit priests . Let us wait and see how many governments will support the Army . I assure you that most of the peoples of the world, all the peoples of the world will express their support for the Salvadoran people . shortly before coming here this evening, I was watching the news via satellite, and I saw protest Demostrations in the United States . The people are protesting the killing of the Jesuit priests and the bombings in El Salvador . Christians, Catholics, clergymen, and priests are protesting in the United States . Therefore, our position is quite clear . We do not renounce the peace agreements . We continue to defend them, and we will demand that the agreements be fulfilled . We are going to demand that the Salvadoran government respect those agreements and respect human rights . What is needed in El Salvador is a cease-fire . a real cease-fire and negotiations are needed in El Salvador to reach an agreement that will allow peace and democracy in El Salvador . No one can be happy with that kind of a Democratic regime--like the U.S. government and the Salvadoran government describe it . that government is known for killing people, for killing clergymen . human rights must be respected in El Salvador . I am grateful to all the comrades who came from the various regions to be here tonight to attend this meeting during which, in addition to discussing several matters of interest for all the Nicaraguan people, we also honored our Evangelistic Brothers who have worked here in Nicaragua for the past 7 years and gave posthumous recognition to our Jesuit Brothers, the priests brutally murdered in El Salvador . We are determined to continue working with the Christian people, the preachers of the gospel, the evangelists and all the churches in our country, for a Nicaragua in peace and democracy . Once again I wish to reiterate: between Christianity and revolution, there is no contradiction."
886,DEV-MUC3-0887,MOSCOW ,1989-11-27,"The Salvadoran government has Rejeted the proposal for an immediate cease-fire that the Farabundo Marti National liberation front, according to Mauricio Sandoval, Salvadoran Minister of culture and communications . Sandoval was interviewed by the U.S. news agency Upi . The Salvadoran patriots made this proposal in response to the OAS recommendation regarding the Salvadoran situation . The recommendation calls for an immediate return to negotiations . Bishop Gregorio Rosa Chavez offered his good offices . Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez has also joined the group of people who are trying to stop the violence in El Salvador . on Tuesday , 21 November, Perez met with officials of the Cristiani administration, namely justice Minister Oscar Santamaria and Minister of Presidency Juan Padela . According to Carlos Andres Perez, he also talked with his Salvadoran counterpart Alfredo Cristiani on the phone . in the course of this talk he offered to host a Caracas meeting between the Salvadoran government and the rebels . It would seem that because of the negative attitude of Cristiani's administration, all these efforts have not yielded the expected fruits . The fact is that the Salvadoran government is trying to worsen the terror . with this in mind, the government is drafting a law to punish the opposition . as a preventive measure, Congress has already approved Antiterrorist bills . These bills allow the arrest of people on suspicion of Antigovernment activities . A Salvadoran deputy has labeled these bills unconstitutional and contrary to human rights . Meanwhile, these bills have encouraged the Acursed death squads . Americas watch, a human rights organization, has reported an increase of, arrests of and threats against foreigners who work for religious and humanitarian organizations in El Salvador . The Salvadoran human rights Commission believes that the crusade against foreign missionaries is encouraged by the Ultrarightists who are operating under the protection of the government . The government guarantees the Reactionaries their impunity . death squads, working closely with reactionary military men and the Cristiani administration, are most certainly to blame for the recent disgraceful murder of six priests in El Salvador, according to the U.S . publication the Boston globe . The paper States that this is obvious to all and that the Salvadoran regime and the Yankee government are the only ones that refuse to admit it . from their point of view this attitude is reasonable . Washington's policy toward El Salvador is based on the Ultrarigthwing forces . The Boston globe adds that every year the taxpayers take out of their pockets $500 million to finance the assistance that the U.S. government gives to El Salvador . Some of this money goes to the death squads which are guilty of thousands of murders Commited amid Hellish tortures . It is a significant piece of information . The thing is that U.S. officials prefer to lash out at the fictitious shipments of Soviet weapons to El Salvador, fictitious because there have been none at all . on the other hand, the use that successive Salvadoran regimes have made of U.S. aid, has always been downplayed . However, it is obvious that without the hefty U.S. subsidies, the Salvadoran conflict would have been resolved a long time ago and the nearly 100,000 Salvadorans who have died in the struggle, would still be alive."
887,DEV-MUC3-0888,MOSCOW ,1989-11-22,"According to some sources, in the past few days more than 1,000 people have died in El Salvador after the intensification of the fight between government forces and the guerrillas . Mikhail Mayorov filed this report: the horrifying reports published by the New York Times give an appropriate idea of the tragedy in El Salvador, where a Civil war is ravaging the country . on the outskirts of San Salvador, where the fight is being waged, the people are forced to burn dead bodies right in front of their houses . The victims are not only soldiers and guerrillas, who are directly involved in the conflict, but also civilians, whose houses are hit by bombs and projectiles . The civilians are constantly threatened by the bullies of the so-called death squads, who murdered six Catholic priests at the San Salvador University campus . The Salvadoran situation, which has caused serious concern, cannot be regarded as something which is commonly referred to as . The interdependence of the world now seems to be stronger than ever . We have finally understood the meaning of the old saying that there is no isolated tragedy . We feel increasingly responsible for what is happening in the so-called hot spots of the planet . Obviously, the first thing to be done to normalize the situation is to stem the direct and indirect flow of military supplies to both sides . Moscow has already taken this position . However, U.S. President George Bush has termed Inadmissible the possibility of halting the aid to the government of Alfredo Cristiani . If we compare the Salvadoran and the Afghan situations, why does the U.S. administration so bitterly Repproached us for helping the Najibullah regime? we have Unfortunately not yet adopted general criteria . Our foreign policy is consistent, Mayorov says . In my opinion, Soviet diplomacy has a more flexible attitude toward the current situation in El Salvador . The Soviet government has abandoned its conservative stand, which made us support just one side . in the final analysis, the war is a tragedy for all the people, and the magnitude of the tragedy grows as the conflict becomes more serious . The Salvadoran conflict will reflect the willingness that Moscow and Washington have to help a small nation, which is tired of a Long-Standing conflict, find a way towards peace . all of us are waiting for the Soviet-U.S . summit which will be held off the coast of Malta . It is difficult to imagine the issues that will be on the agenda because the meeting will be unofficial . There are many issues that may be addressed in a bilateral summit . It is highly desirable, however, that both sides reach an understanding and that they identify the possibilities of cooperation for the resolution of the central American problem."

We have his identity, he is Affilitated to the Fmln, but we will not release his name while the investigation is under way . The Salvadoran people are the best witness to the Fmln aggression against our people . Ponce also said that the terrorists carry out these actions as part of their strategy to scare the population . We want to say that conditions to enable Marxism and the Fmln to win are practically nil . The people completely reject them . The Fmln are using that lying and losing Venceremos radio station to fool their own Cadres . In Nicaragua, there were some stations that were in network with this lying and losing Venceremos radio station, broadcasting false reports about El Salvador . This is also part of the aggression . to allow their so-called High-Ranking Fmln commanders to be in Nicaragua is also part of the aggression . No one can ignore the aggression that the Sandinist government has been exerting for a long time against the Salvadoran government and people . having found these sophisticated weapons, does it mean you may expect the aggressive Counteroffensive these groups are launching may widen? definitely not . We believe their Cadres are decimated . This could affect mainly our air force; however, we are taking the proper tactical and technical preventive measures . What should be very clear to all Salvadorans is that for the Fmln to attain power, which is their goal, they will have to climb over the body of the last armed forces soldier . Ponce also said that the missiles and other weapons sent by Ortega for the Fmln are Agressions against the Salvadoran people, explaining that it was a Nicaraguan who lives in this capital who identified the man who piloted the small aircraft carrying the weapons for the terrorists . He said that it was Quiros Garcia . However, that evening he called back and said that the pilot should have part of his thumb missing, and to please check him out . The body we have was checked and one of the thumbs has a part missing . to us this is Irrefutable proof . We all know of Ortega's Cyncism . on the one hand, he made promises at Esquipulas II, signing agreements he was not prepared to implement; he would not do it since he was really doing these other things . He is the same as the Fmln . The Fmln was discussing peace at a dialogue table while it was preparing for this offensive . It is a mockery of the people, because their desire for peace has been fooled with . domestic and international public opinion have been fooled . Finally, Ponce said the subversive groups have low morale and are desperate, because if Daniel Ortega loses the elections, they, too, will lose, and forever . Additionally, the Salvadoran people do not support their irrational actions that only produce death and destruction."
892,DEV-MUC3-0893,SAN SALVADOR,1989-11-28,"There is profound indignation over the murder of Dr. Francisco Jose Guerrero, president of the Supreme Court of justice . The murder was committed by terrorists at about 0930 this morning . According to witnesses, the terrorists drove a yellow Volkswagen . President Alfredo Cristiani ordered a complete investigation to determine who murdered Dr Guerrero and to bring them to trial according to the Salvadoran penal code, which was modified a few days ago . Both private and public sectors have spoken out against these crimes, because they only bring more grief and pain to the suffering Salvadoran people."
893,DEV-MUC3-0894,SAN SALVADOR,1989-11-28,"At least 9 people have died and 13 more were wounded--including soldiers, rebels, and civilians--in the armed confrontations during the past few hours in San Salvador and 2 departments in the North and east of El Salvador, according to military reports . four guerrillas died and two soldiers were wounded in confrontations that occurred early this morning in the cities of Mejicanos and Ciudad Delgado, located north of San Salvador, according to the same reports . The confrontations, in which carbines, mortars, and explosives were used, began at 0230, when the rebels``tried to enter""the northern suburbs of San Salvador, but they were``repelled""by government troops with the support of the Air Force, according to the Army's press office . Another four guerrillas were killed and two were wounded in armed confrontations in Tonacatepeque , 16 km north of San Salvador, and in Chalatenango and San Miguel, located in the northern and Eastern parts of the country, respectively . The Army has acknowledged that one soldier died and another five were wounded in those places . The Armed Forces have stated that four employees of the Rio Lempa hydroelectric executive Commission were wounded by explosives that had been placed by the rebels in a technical Institute located in the Zacamil neighborhood, which had been occupied for some days by the rebels during the recent offensive . The Army also indicates that the rebels set fire to a car and another two vehicles in San Salvador and San Miguel."
894,DEV-MUC3-0895,SAN SALVADOR,1989-11-28,"In light of the terrorist armed aggression launched against the Salvadoran people by the Fmln with the open support and direction of the Sandinist government headed by Daniel Ortega on 11 November, the Salvadoran government advises the international community that on the day the current government assumed office, it expressed its firm desire to seek, through the civilized path of dialogue, a comprehensive solution to the conflict because the Marxist - Leninist group's cause brings bloodshed to our people . In this sense, president Cristiani's government promoted the process of dialogue that began in Mexico city on 13 , 14, and 15 September 1989 . At that time, government and Fmln delegations signed an agreement committing themselves to seek an end to hostilities within the spirit of the agreements signed by the central American Presidents in Tela, Honduras . based on the agreement reached in Mexico city, the issue to be broached during the second round of talks to be held in San Jose, Costa Rica, on 16 and 17 October would be the end to hostilities based on proposals presented by the government and the Fmln . At that time, the Fmln did not allow the discussion of the topic previously agreed on and presented a series of proposals, deliberately complex in form and content, with the evident purpose of preventing the main and only topic on the agenda from being discussed . On 11 November, the Fmln launched an aggression against the Salvadoran people, an aggression that was obviously planned at least a few months before it was launched . This proves that while the Fmln was talking peace and negotiations around the negotiating table, it was, with the political, logistical, and military support of Ortega's government, preparing the criminal attack against the Salvadoran people . Since the beginning of the terrorist aggression to date, certain things have happened that prove the Sandinist government's involvement in the genocide implemented by the Fmln terrorists . The Salvadoran government has proof that the Fmln is a puppet of Daniel Ortega's deadly plans who, faced with an imminent electoral defeat and in conjunction with Fidel Castro, is attempting to Regionalize in Central America an armed conflict to try to save the Sandinist regime . In light of the aforementioned and having established the participation of the Sandinist government in the terrorist aggression experienced by the Salvadoran people, the Salvadoran government agreed, on 26 November 1989, to suspend diplomatic and commercial relations with the Nicaraguan government and recalled its diplomatic mission for consultations . In light of these serious actions which violate international law, the Salvadoran government has presented formal charges before the United Nations and the OAS so that immediate and efficient measures will be taken to repudiate these terrorist actions and so that the Nicaraguan government will be diplomatically and politically pressured to stop the aggression it has unleashed against El Salvador, and thus stop a possible conflict of unpredictable dimensions . How is it possible that at a time like this, when around the world moments of political freedom are being experienced in places like Poland, the GDR, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, here, in El Salvador, because of the Fmln's irrational actions--with Ortega's support--attempts are being made to drown a nation which, despite 10 years of war, is trying to consolidate a democratic process? the Salvadoran government and people are United during this historic test to achieve peace within the democratic system."
895,DEV-MUC3-0896,SAN SALVADOR,1989-11-28,"Deputy defense Minister Colonel Juan Orlando Zepeda has said that the armed forces structure remains intact and that the Fmln terrorists have no possibility of launching another offensive . Col Zepeda said that the Communist's indiscriminate attack was launched against the civilian population and not against the military . According to the military chief, the terrorists were trying to encourage an uprising among the people; however, they failed in their attempt because the people turned their backs on them and gave their support to the armed forces . Col Zepeda said that the support of the people for the armed forces has been essential and very important to neutralize the Fmln's Communist attack . The deputy defense minister said that thanks to this total support, the armed forces have been able to locate a lot of weapons and ammunition . Col Zepeda mentioned the Altos de la Cueva case in San Miguel, where approximately a million rounds of ammunition were found . Zepeda called on the people to maintain their trust in the armed forces, adding that the armed forces' morale is high, very high."

Our units entered the Manuel Jose Arce neighborhood inhabited by High-Ranking military chiefs and occupied several houses there . Our forces found arsenals in some of the houses and clashed against enemy troops . Our forces seized many weapons including rifles, Machineguns, ammunition, and other war material . all those weapons were found in the houses of several High-Ranking military chiefs in the Manuel Jose Arce neighborhood . We also have reports on clashes in the area of Antiguo Cuscatlan where military detachment no 6 reinforcements refused to advance . The Sonsonate troops refused to advance toward our positions in the area of Antiguo Cuscatlan . Similarly, our forces are holding positions in Soyapango, Mejicanos, Cuscatancingo, and Ayutuxtepeque . Our forces also have control of the northern trunk highway and other important routes leading to San Salvador . There are clashes against Bracamonte Battalion troops in La Sultana neighborhood, San Francisco, and Antiguo Cuscatlan . The enemy has reacted in four different ways . The enemy sent Bracamonte Battalion reinforcements in one direction, but their advance was neutralized and halted at the Escalon neighborhood . We repeat . The first high command response to our incursion into Northwestern and Western San Salvador residential neighborhoods including Bracamonte Battalion reinforcements has been neutralized . Our forces ambushed and neutralized those Bracamonte Battalion reinforcements . a second enemy response to our incursion into and control of Northwestern and Western San Salvador moved along the Southern highway and was ambushed with Rpg-7 rocket launchers and therefore neutralized . The enemy's third response moving through Santa Tecla was also attacked by our forces and has been neutralized with an ambush near La universal and Guadalupe gardens . These Atlacatl Battalion forces were also neutralized . We are receiving this report from San Salvador . The high command's first and belated response included four movements, which were all halted by our forces . those four high command defensive movements have been attacked and neutralized . both the Bracamonte and the Atlacatl battalions have been neutralized . Meanwhile the troops coming from Sonsonate refused to advance in southwestern San Salvador . clashes now cover a large area from the highway linking Santa Tecla and San Salvador and through La Mascota, Las Palmas, San Benito, Maquiligue, Campestre, Lomas Verdes, Escalon neighborhoods, continuing to the San Salvador volcano and moving through the entire northern San Salvador including Ayutuxtepeque, Cuscatancingo, northern Mejicanos, and Mejicanos itself and then moving to Ciudad Delgado, Soyapango, and the Southern section of the Pan-American highway, where our units maintain positions and are advancing toward enemy forces . In other words, at this hour the Fmln has formed the largest arch of attacks during our forces' entire occupation of San Salvador."

It was reported that hundreds of little soldiers have been placed as cannon fodder outside the general staff installations . This gives us new intelligence data on the morale of Col Ponce, how the crisis is affecting him . without any military criterion, he has placed a wall of soldiers around the general staff Instalations . This is a good piece of intelligence given to us by Col Ponce, concerning his physical state and concerning the upset being suffered by the strategic armed forces general staff command . We call on the inhabitants of the country club, the Maquiliguas, San Benito, and Escalon neighborhoods to immediately abandon that combat zone . The fighting will get worse and the Air force will bomb the Fmln positions in San Benito and Escalon neighborhoods, therefore its inhabitants are urged to abandon that residential district in San Salvador . a report from Usulutan indicates at this time that the Fmln units are advancing and fighting in the sector of Gaviria, El Manguito, and Los Pilotos neighborhoods in the city of Usulutan . Also, in the area of Santa Elena there is fierce fighting . your attention please . We have another report from San Salvador . important information is being received from Lomas Verdes . in the strategic zone of Lomas Verdes in the Northwestern part of the capital, an Army armored vehicle was destroyed and its 50-Caliber machinegun was seized, as well as many rifles and Machineguns from the national police and cavalry troops . your attention to this report from San Salvador . fighting in the exclusive Lomas Verdes neighborhood indicates that an armored vehicle was destroyed .

The report reads: the Salvadoran guerrillas today unleashed a new offensive in San Salvador with attacks on military installations and fierce clashes with the Army in several neighborhoods in San Salvador, which continue up until Mid-Morning on 29 November . The Acan-Efe report adds: the guerrillas' actions affected Escalon, San Francisco, and San Benito neighborhoods where the residences of President Alfredo Cristiani and U.S .

This has been an Acan-Efe report on the situation in San Salvador."
899,DEV-MUC3-0900,CLANDESTINE,1989-11-29,"The fighting in the San Salvador residential areas brings up substantial differences in the form and content of the war in El Salvador when the fighting takes place in the neighborhoods of the poor and when the fighting takes place in the neighborhoods of the rich . today, when the fighting took place in various parts of the capital city, including places such as the Escalon, San Benito, San Francisco, and general Arce residential areas where U.S . diplomatic personnel live, where the military officers and government officials have their residences, where the Salvadoran high society has its residences, then the repercussions are very different . U.S. government spokesmen reacted quickly and without delay . Marlin Fitzwater, James Baker, the State Department, Ambassador Walker, everyone was very worried over the fate of U.S . personnel . They expressed angry words against the Farabundo Marti National liberation front . If there is someone in the world that is well informed of the war situation in El Salvador, it is precisely the Pentagon, the State Department, and the U.S. Embassy, because they have financed and given advice to the Salvadoran Army . It is not our presence in the San Salvador residential areas that jeopardizes U.S . personnel . on the contrary, it is the U.S . presence, the U.S. meddling in El Salvador that is jeopardizing its staff . they cannot ask us to get out of San Salvador so that the Americans will not be trapped in the crossfire . It is the U.S . intervention in the country that must come to an end, so that we Salvadorans will be able to settle our problems among ourselves . This is our land, our Fatherland . The war was imposed by the injustices, the Slaughters, the Dictatorships, and to a great extent, by the Americans who spend $1.4 million daily in this war . This is a crucial moment for El Salvador . that is why we demand that the U.S. administration, that is, the Bush administration, the U.S. Congress, and the U.S. people carefully think this over and act sensibly so that we will be able to put an end to this war . It is imperative that the U.S. government--the Bush administration--think this over and promote changes in its policy toward El Salvador, and thus make feasible a solution to the conflict . We have publicly and officially said, as one of our many gestures of good will, that the Fmln will not attack U.S . diplomatic installations or personnel in El Salvador . In addition, we have instructed our units, our fighters, and commando groups not to attack diplomatic sites, because naturally they are not military targets for the Fmln . We hope that in the same manner, both the U.S. Embassy as well as the other diplomatic representatives will instruct their security guards so they will not become involved in the fighting, thus preventing confusion that we would all regret . The U.S. government can play a positive role in defining the conflict . The U.S. Congress and other international organizations, such as the United Nations and the OAS, are already discussing the true situation of our country . We believe this is the moment to change policies . The U.S. government cannot continue to finance and support a regime which is bombing the civilian population in the cities, a regime which murders priests, which publicly threatens the bishops . The U.S. government must use its good judgment and contribute to the end of the war, and not continue to support a Fascist regime that is not acceptable in our Fatherland, El Salvador."

Nevertheless, armed forces spokesman major Mauricio Chavez said on a radio and television network that in the Escalon neighborhood``the situation remains difficult because the terrorists have taken several civilians as hostages .""the source said that an unspecified number of civilians are being held hostage by guerrillas in Escalon, an exclusive neighborhood in the northen part of San Salvador, where clashes resumed at dawn on 29 November . The Farabundo Marti National liberation front today also attacked the general staff, a residence for U.S. military advisers, and President Alfredo Cristiani's residence . The rebels have occupied several mansions from which they are attacking the government troops in an area populated by government officials, diplomats, and where the UN office in El Salvador is located . According to the officer, the Army has besieged the area and``expects to control the situation within the next few hours .""major Chavez Caceres Reasserted the``Army's irrevocable will to defend the civilian population""in that area, while the Salvadoran green cross reported that it has evacuated several families from the sector."

902,DEV-MUC3-0903,MOSCOW ,1989-11-29,"Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani announced last Sunday that the Republic of El Salvador has broken diplomatic ties with Nicaragua . analyst Aleksey Pavlov discusses this subject: for those who are familiar with Central American issues, this news is no surprise . given the failure of the negotiations between the Salvadoran government and the guerrillas as well as the resumption of the war, the Cristiani administration was pressured by certain U.S . circles to break relations with Nicaragua . The media are conducting a crusade to convince the public that Cuba, Nicaragua, and certainly the USSR, are providing weapons to the Revolutionaries . The United States certainly plays an important role in this campaign, and so has President Cristiani by declaring that he will not attend the regional Presidential summit scheduled for December in Managua . apparently, Cristiani needed to break relations with Nicaragua in order not to attend to the summit . This is Comprehensible because the central American Presidents are supposed to discuss the compliance with the Tela agreements, the dismantling of the Contras, and the continuation of peace talks in El Salvador . In fact, Cristiani was unable to justify his refusal to attend this summit . There are other reasons why Cristiani wishes to use the break with Nicaragua as a mask . He is trying to distract public attention from the Salvadoran Army's heavy bombings of heavily populated areas, including the capital, and the repression against Salvadoran religious and labor organizations . In other terms, Cristiani wants to conceal the fact that he cannot control the excesses committed by his generals; that is, the genocide that the Salvadoran Army is Perpetrating against its own people . The Cristiani administration is also unable to control the death squads which are murdering people with impunity . It is revealing that several days before Cristiani declared the break of diplomatic ties with Nicaragua, Nicaraguan embassy staff in San Salvador were evacuated home in face of the death threats by the death squads . is this mere coincidence? of course not . Most probably these death squads received orders to make such threats with a view toward the diplomatic break . by what can be seen, the action of death squads is common practice for the Salvadoran government . However, this diplomatic break is a serious act for which Cristiani is largely responsible . Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo considers this action a great danger to peace in the Isthmus . This is an unquestionable fact."
903,DEV-MUC3-0904,CLANDESTINE,1989-11-30,"Regarding the International scandal that the Salvadoran government has made over an alleged shipment of Surface-To-Air missiles found inside a wrecked light aircraft, the Fmln expresses the following : 1 . In view of a possible intensification of the Salvadoran conflict, it is necessary to note that the Salvadoran armed forces were the first ones to escalate the war by launching indiscriminate attacks and air bombings against the civilian population in Densely populated urban areas . The Salvadoran armed forces had been doing this for several years in our country's rural areas . In view of the damage that this causes the population, since 1987 the Fmln has made proposals to scale down the war and suspend the use of aircraft and aviation equipment . The Salvadoran government's charges are hypocritical, as the government itself has turned aircraft into real instruments of genocide against the Salvadoran people . 2 . The policy of the previous U.S. administration has turned Central America into a huge arms market whereby thousands of tons of Soviet and U.S . weapons, including Surface-To air missiles, have been introduced into the area . This has created a flourishing black market for weapons, where Salvadoran and Honduran military men and Nicaraguan Contras participate as big-time smugglers . 3 . The Salvadoran government has begun a campaign of accusations against the Nicaraguan government with the intention of putting up a smoke screen to cover the genocide it has unleashed and to divert the attention of the international community, which has been demanding: a) that the Salvadoran government stop the massive and indiscriminate attacks in Densely populated urban areas and the persecution against the political opposition and grass roots movements; B) an investigation to clear up the murder of six Jesuit priests and two domestic workers, along with the punishment of those responsible for these and similar crimes; and, C) that the Salvadoran government accept the cease-fire it has heretofore rejected and justify its intransigent and irrational position . 4 . Cristiani's decision to suspend relations with Nicaragua based on an alleged shipment of missiles for the Fmln is not reasonable, not even by saying that this represents an escalation of the Salvadoran war . In fact, the U.S. government has escalated the war by sending $4 billion in aid to strengthen the Army and provide it with a powerful Air force . The justification has always been Nicaragua's support to the Fmln, thus refusing to admit the internal causes of the conflict and also keeping the doors closed to any negotiations . This has unnecessarily prolonged the Salvadoran people's suffering and has made more dramatic their legitimate struggle for a true Democratic, Pluralist, and Non-Aligned government . based on the above, we reiterate : 1 . that we consider absolutely legitimate our right to obtain all types of weapons to guarantee our defense and to protect our people from the military escalation promoted by the Salvadoran government with the firm support of the previous and present U.S . governments . This includes the right to obtain weapons from various sources and to guarantee their arrival at our war fronts through any means available . 2 . We maintain our total willingness to De-Escalate the war . We begin by expressing that we are totally willing to agree on a cease-fire with international supervision and to begin real negotiations to end the war with the participation of all the nation's political and social forces . 3 . We are willing to refrain from using the Surface-To-Air missiles if the Air Force calls a complete halt to its bombings, strafing, and Machinegunning throughout the National territory .

These claims are absolutely false . The residents of those municipalities are going to their jobs, buses are operating, and everyday activities are being conducted in a normal manner . The liar radio stations of the Fmln think they can confuse the public opinion with their false information . These stations are used for propagandistic and Disinformation purposes to make it appear as if the Fmln is winning military victories, which they have never attained and which are only in the minds of Ortega's puppets, who broadcast from Managua . The people are asking themselves: where are the cowardly terrorist and murderous Chiefs of the Fmln, Shafik Handal, Joaquin Villalobos, and other cowards, who are in Managua enjoying a luxurious life and good food? the Salvadoran people are fully aware of the victorious actions of our Armed Forces, who since the beginning of this Genocidal and terrorist Fmln offensive have faced the aggressive mercenaries by reducing them to small terrorist groups, which are lost and are irrationally attacking the civilian population . The Fmln has ridiculously claimed to completely control certain municipalities . all of these lies show that the murderous Fmln leaders do not have any arguments with which to conceal their unsuccessful rebel offensive . their greatest failure has been the Salvadoran people's rejection of the Rebel actions . Despite so many threats made by the Fmln terrorists, our people have never supported them, let alone agreed to accept the weapons that the Fmln were offering them if they joined the rebellion . The Fmln and its terrorist offensive, which was conducted with the weapons that dictator Ortega has given to the Fmln puppets, has failed, and the Salvadoran people expect the nations of the free world to condemn this Genocidal aggression of international communism."
906,DEV-MUC3-0907,MOSCOW ,1989-12-01,"Judging by news agency reports, the development of events in El Salvador has reached an extremely dangerous point . President Cristiani's refusal to respond to the insurgents' recent Cease- fire proposal has resulted in a fresh outbreak of bloodshed . having rejected out of hand last week the very idea of the resumption of talks with the Farabundo Marti liberation movement, the government has made no secret of its intention of quickly driving the guerrillas back into the mountains using U.S. military supplies .``elite""Army battalions had already prepared for punitive assaults . But what happened? the regime's gamble on military force proved futile . The insurgents regrouped their forces, brought up reserves, and struck a powerful new blow . The Salvadoran drama is increasingly sharply at variance with the improvement of the international climate . representatives of the United Nations, the OAS, the EEC, the Vatican, France, and a number of other countries and organizations are now stressing the acute need to urge the warring sides in El Salvador to reach a peaceful settlement based on mutual compromise . and it is a very great pity that such an appeal has not come from that capital which the Salvadoran authorities heed above all others--Washington . attention is drawn to the urgent evacuation of U.S. citizens from El Salvador that was announced yesterday . I recognize that in the conditions of an armed conflict this is a necessary step . But it is no secret that in the recent past such actions by the U.S. administration were an ominous symptom of the preparation of overtly Interventionist plans . end the bloodshed--that is the priority task today . and the restoration of the dialogue between the government and the insurgents that was broken off should be the first step toward that."
907,DEV-MUC3-0908,SAN SALVADOR,1989-11-30,"Following a Soviet order, Daniel Ortega has been forced to Expell from Nicaragua the Fmln terrorist leaders who for years have kept their general command post in Managua, with Ortega's support and protection . When the Soviet government confirmed that Ortega had supplied arms to the Fmln, which were secretly intended for the exclusive use of the Sandinist Army--as was the case of the Sam-7 missiles--they ordered him to stop supporting the Fmln terrorists because this is endangering USSR and U.S. rapprochement policies . The Kremlin has reacted with noticeable annoyance following Fidel Castro and Daniel Ortega's direct meddling, which is causing serious divisions within the leadership of the Sandinist government because some of the commanders did not agree on supporting the Fmln terrorist upsurge . The expulsion order for Jorge Shafik Handal, Joaquin Villalobos, and other Fmln leaders is expected any moment now . This will significantly reduce the Fmln's political clout . at the summit meeting between the Soviet and U.S. Presidents, Castro and Ortega's aggression, using the Fmln against the Salvadoran people, will be reviewed following President Arias of Costa Rica's initiative."

He added that he has telephoned Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani and U.S. President George Bush and told them about this . The Venezuelan President said that in spite of the fact the evidence points in one direction to the authors of the crimes committed on 16 November,``We cannot take any sides in this issue, particularly when we are trying to find a solution, and that is exactly what we have done .""concerning the Spanish government's decision to suspend cooperation with the governments of El Salvador and Nicaragua, Perez pointed out that this action is one way of maintaining an active neutrality . According to the Venezuelan President, the Spanish stand is one of cooperation so that there will be peace and understanding in Central America, because it is withdrawing the aid as long as it is unclear how serious the conflicting parties are about reaching an agreement."

Both missed their targets . The air forces officers involved reported that in both cases the Sam-7 missiles were detected by observer planes, which in turn warned the two Salvadoran Air Force A-37 planes that the missiles were headed toward them . The two planes were flying patrol missions in the Zacatecoluca area . Both Sam-7 missiles failed to strike their targets thanks to the professionalism of the pilots, who maneuvered to prevent the Fmln missiles from hitting them . The Fmln continues to receive Soviet arms supplies through Cuba and Nicaragua, an action which has already been officially denounced to the entire world and which the Salvadoran people fully repudiate . The Sandinist government has supplied the Fmln terrorists with this type of sophisticated weaponry of Soviet manufacture, which confirms that the Fmln, apart from having its general command inside Nicaraguan territory, has the military support and guidance of the Sandinist regime . official sources believe that the Sam-7 missiles fired by the Fmln against the Air Force planes could be among the weapons that were Onboard the other small plane that was set on fire by the terrorists after they had unloaded it . As soon as the Salvadoran government learned of the Sam-7 shipments to the Fmln, they reported it to the international community . In response to this report, the Soviet government, showing great annoyance, ordered a freeze on all arms shipments to the Ortega government, which, following orders from Fidel Castro, supplies military equipment to the Fmln terrorists .

Ponce also said that many internationalists join the terrorist groups, thus violating the rights of all the Salvadoran people . Ponce said that the leaders of the front groups defined their positions when they joined the Fmln to carry out the so-called final offensive, which has proven to be a total failure because the Salvadoran people believe in democracy and not communism . The chief of the general staff also met with foreign correspondents . He said that the Fmln currently has the support of only Nicaragua, Cuba, and Russia, but they do not have the essential support of the Salvadoran people; therefore, Thye are doomed to Political-Military failure . all the Fmln has left is its propaganda tactics at the national and international level . Col Ponce talked about the casualties inflicted on the Fmln terrorists through 0600 on 28 November . Ponce said that 1,680 rebels had been killed and more than double that number wounded .

The National Guard reported that it arrested 15 people last week at various places in here in San Salvador and other persons at the offices of the so-called awareness for spiritual and economic recovery of man, at the Episcopal church on 63 South Avenue and Olimpica Avenue in San Salvador . Several persons who were held hostage there on 30 October later appeared at the central police headquarters to report the abuse . When National Guard personnel began the subsequent investigation that same day, it was discovered that the arrested persons had committed other actions in violation of our laws and against the country's security . After determining that this Episcopal Church was visited by persons involved in subversive activities and that it harbored a group that is an Fmln front, the place was search and it was discovered that, in addition to the church, offices of Credho also operated there--Credho is an affiliate of an organization they call Diacomias; that 60 persons are employed there; that most of those persons are not parishioners, but Credho employees; that Credho's director is a priest of Spanish origin named Luis Serrano Lorente; and that this priest is now a naturalized Salvadoran . There the National Guard personnel arrested Jose Horacio Guzman Rivas, Jose Eduardo Sanchez Castillo, Luis Gustavo Lopez Magana, Jose Vidal Enamorado Diaz, Elba Ruth Alfaro Valencia, Alex Antonio Tovar Flores, Jose Candelario Aguilar Alvarez, and Randolfo Campo Benavides . in connection with the same case, they also arrested Juan Antonio Versico Nunez, Ana Julio Rodriguez, and Jose Francisco Pastoranges at various places in the Ciudad Satelite neighborhood . later on, Luis Serrano Lorente, pastor of this Anglican church, was arrested in the Lomas Verdes neighborhood . Julio Cesar Castro Ramirez and Julio Eugenia Aguilera Escobar were later arrested in Santa Ana, and, Lastly, Aida Margarita Gomez de Leon was arrested in the don Bosco residential neighborhood in Santa Tecla . Serrano said he is the director of Credho and responsible for the aforementioned church . He asserted that he learned on 29 October that in the churchyard two trucks were loaded with explosives, which were hurled the next day at the military complex of the armed forces joint Chiefs of staff . He decided to remain silent about this, thereby covering for the terrorist criminals who murder humble working people . Serrano also said that Credho is financed by a front group called Diacomias, which has no legal status, but is the channel for aid that is sent in cash by so-called solidarity churches and associations organized in Sweden, Britain, Netherlands, Canada, the United States, and Australia . This money is distributed to Lutheran, Catholic, Emanuel Baptist, and Episcopal churches, as well as to the foundation for promotion of cooperatives and the Federation of cooperatives for development . These groups comprise Diacomias and twice a month, one representative from each group meets at the Episcopal church to discuss distribution of these large amounts of money, most of which, he said, is delivered to low income communities they have organized that are directed by the Fmln front groups."
919,DEV-MUC3-0920,BOGOTA,1989-12-01,"Fellow patriots, I am addressing the nation today to explain the government's position concerning the issue of Extradition, which was the subject of a very intense debate last night at the Chamber of Representatives' first Commission . a proposal was put forward to the effect that in the extraordinary referendum scheduled for 21 January--which is contemplated in the constitutional reform that is currently in its final stages--an additional question be included with regard to whether or not you, the Colombian people, want Colombian criminals to be Extradited . This question would join four other issues that had already been approved for submission to popular consultation on 21 January . on behalf of the National government, the government Minister immediately expressed the disadvantages of approving that proposal . I have consulted with former Presidents Alberto Lleras, Carlos Lleras Restrepo, Alfonso Lopez, and Julio Cesar Turbay about including the Extradition issue in the referendum, and they feel that with the current public order situation, especially when the government has been dealing successfully with the struggle against drug trafficking, it would be Disadvantageous to use the referendum to decide on Extradition . the country must not deceive itself as to where we would be headed if we held a referendum on the issue of Extradition, and as to the fatal consequences of such an action on the country's morale and on democracy's survival . Initially, I am not talking about Extraditing Colombian criminals for them to stand trial in other countries, but of Extraditing drug traffickers who have committed crimes abroad . Extradition is not punishment for society because it refers only to drug traffickers, neither is it an affront to sovereignty, as some people have tried to portray it . Extradition has been dealt with in Colombian international treaties . The direction of international policy lies within the exclusive realm of the Presidency of the Republic, according to the Constitution . Congress cannot take the initiative of abolishing public Extradition treaties by resorting to legislative or constituent provisions . This is clear in light of Colombian public law, and it is imperative according to the Vienna convention, which Colombia recently approved . According to this convention, the Extradition treaty will prevail over internal provisions . In other words, the treaties that Colombia has signed with regard to Extradition cannot be disregarded through internal legislation . This can only be done through diplomatic efforts such as denouncing the treaties and directly informing the counterpart . for 100 years Colombian law has authorized the Extradition of criminals . I repeat , 100 years, since 1888, and only now, when Extradition is applied to drug traffickers, are there objections to its alleged violations of sovereignty . practically all the countries of the world, with very few exception, have and apply treaties to Extradite terrorists or Whomever commits crimes against humanity, such as drug trafficking . over the past 10 years, no more than 30 people have been Extradited to several countries that requested the Extraditions and complied with the necessary laws . Therefore, Extradition is not a general threat against all COLOMBIANS . It only affects those who have committed the crime of drug trafficking abroad . Secondly, some people have said that Extradition has created violence and, therefore, with its elimination, violence would disappear . Neither is true . The violence perpetrated by drug traffickers had been suffered prior to the 1979 Extradition treaty . after the treaty went into effect, hundreds of COLOMBIANS were murdered, including justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla . in December 1986, a Supreme Court decision left the Extradition treaty inapplicable . In other words, after this, while Extradition was inapplicable, attorney general Carlos Mauro Hoyos was Slain, Bogota Mayor Andres Pastrana was kidnapped, and newsman Guillermo Cano, political leader Jaime Pardo Leal, and hundreds of COLOMBIANS were sacrificed."
920,DEV-MUC3-0921,BOGOTA,1989-12-01,"Last year, without Extradition in effect, over 600 anonymous Colombian peasants were murdered in more than 40 Massacres by hired assassins paid by drug traffickers . There is even more: Let us not forget Antioquia governor Antonio Roldan Betancur, magistrate Carlos Valencia, Colonel Franklyn Quintero, and Senator Luis Carlos Galan who were murdered when Extradition was not in effect . Let us not say that Extradition has brought us violence . A poster found at the farm raided last week, from where Pablo Escobar escaped read: Extradition is violence . Let us not be fooled; violence has been used by drug traffickers by murdering, while fleeing from the reaction of justice, and Intimidating Colombian society . It has also been said that Extradition is Undignified because it sends COLOMBIANS abroad to be tried, and that it is more dignified for them to be tried and condemned in the country by our own judges . The drug traffickers, however, have sent more than 200 Colombian judges and judicial branch officials to their grave . for example, the investigation into the murder of Dr Guillermo Cano has meant the death of witnesses, judicial officials, and lawyers and intimidation and threats to all those who want to cooperate with justice to resolve a crime . How then can we believe these drug traffickers? can we believe that Extradition has caused this violence? can we have a free and dignified country with these bands of multimillionaire murderers? I would also like to explain to you why the government considers it harmful and dangerous to submit Extradition to a referendum . We know that Extradition is only for drug traffickers . We know what they have done and what they are capable of doing . We have suffered from their terrorist actions . Many brave COLOMBIANS have been murdered for the simple reason of not agreeing with drug trafficking . do you believe that on this topic of Extradition there could be a clean electoral campaign, free from intimidation? do you believe that those who are against drug trafficking can, without fear, give their opinion? it would be a campaign slanted by terrorism, intimidation, and drug traffickers' money . The government cannot subject citizens to an electoral process that would not be to convince COLOMBIANS, but to intimidate them . A referendum is for people to express their free and sovereign decision on a topic of general interest . to include Extradition in the referendum would only serve so that a handful--less than 100--drug traffickers can, by using their money and terror, intimidate public opinion, the media, and all COLOMBIANS, so as to avoid being tried and condemned for crimes that they had committed abroad . conditions of terrorism do not allow this topic to be decided freely . I call for good sense, for Sensibleness, so that the dark interests of a few private people are not confused with the general interest of all COLOMBIANS . I call for COLOMBIANS not to allow the constitutional reforms that are in the final discussion, or the first referendum in over 30 years, to be used in an opportunistic way to serve selfish interests . The government is convinced that the constitutional reforms and the extraordinary referendum will be an important advancement for the institutions . They will allow greater participation by the people in state decisions, in Congress, and are without doubt a step toward peace . I know there are some who say that drug traffickers want peace and tranquility . I want to say that eliminating Extradition will not bring tranquility, but impunity and more violence . This is why it is advisable that parliamentarians not allow institutional changes to be endangered or the peace accords be put to serious risk due to the inclusion in the referendum of a topic that not only would not be good for the country, but would be dangerous to all COLOMBIANS . As is publicly known, I will travel on 3 December at the official invitation of the Japanese government . This is part of Colombia's opening to the Pacific . There, I shall meet with Emperor Akihito; with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu; with the legislative chambers; with industrial, political, and academic leaders; and with Japanese government lending and trade entities . There, I shall present a true picture of Colombia--a country with difficulties, but with the national resolve to overcome them . We are a country with a promising future, with Hard-Working people, and with vast natural resources . a few criminals will not be able to snatch that future from us . good night, and see you soon."

Oramas charged that the U.S. assistance has been the main cause of the torture, murders, and Disappearances that have become a daily occurrence in the central American nation . Oramas added that despite the great effort made by the U.S. administration to conceal its responsibility for the violence prevailing in El Salvador, the international community will not be deceived and the facts that will go down in history will show that the peoples have pointed their accusing fingers at the United States . The Cuban diplomat rebutted the U.S. charges aimed at shifting responsibility to our country for the Salvadoran situation . The U.S. charges were to be expected, Oramas said."

It also condemns the``brutal way in which they were massacred, which proves how far down the moral sense and human quality of those who perpetrated the crime has fallen .""regarding peace in Central America, the highest ranking leaders of the church in the area point out that there are many factors preventing or hampering efforts to build a long lasting peace . Among the factors the bishops mention is``the persistence of serious social problems--hunger, unemployment, the high cost of living, and the reality of an underprivileged class--yet most rulers and other bodies holding power do not show any desire to eliminate these factors .""in addition, the``criminal stubbornness""of searching for a military and armed solution to the situation of violence has generated``the deeply rooted Unjustice in our reality, which is aggravated by the outrageous meddling of foreign superpowers .""`` the interest of a group or ideologies prevail over the needs and rights of citizens ,""the Sedac documents States . The heads of the churches of the six Isthmian countries add that this Hastens the``criminal and immoral""arms buildup, which, with the exception of Costa Rica, has led people in the area into increasing Impoverishment and a rise in their foreign debt .``the smuggling of weapons to strengthen subversive movements of various tendencies is no less outrageous and criminal than the existence of death squads or paramilitary groups ,""the Sedac document adds . It is worrying to see how some nations in the area promote campaigns such as``an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth"", or promote``Antiterrorist""laws that can be used for the outrageous abuse of power in order to eliminate adversaries, the bishops pointed out . to all these evils one must add the flight of capital, the increasing drug trafficking, and the resulting corruption, violence, and death."
923,DEV-MUC3-0924,CLANDESTINE,,"Now they are still doing the same thing, except that the killings are those of the Jesuit priests, the places burned are homes in the Densely populated neighborhoods and the UN headquarters, and those accused of collaborating with the Fmln are the Episcopal churches . The strategy is the same . The Fmln continues to strike at and mock the armed forces . far from diminishing in number, it has increased in number . The persecution of the church, the indiscriminate bombings, the press censorship, and, above all, the apparent direction taken by the situation as a result of the armed forces' leadership have shown the world that nothing has changed . The military continues to be in command, and Cristiani's moderation was but a costly Makeover . The U.S. analysts are beginning to react . After 9 years of investing at all levels to put an end to the capital and the principal cities of the country with a strategic siege, with the theater of operations in the trouble spots, and without any prospect of controlling the situation, the order of the day in the halls of Congress is a change of policy and the promotion of negotiation . all the world is suffering deeply, without the hope of a change of policy . what the U.S. Congress is studying is whether it will continue with that policy which does not change at all, which protects the assassins of Monsignor Romero, the four U.S. nuns, Ignacio Ellacuria, and five more Jesuits . It is studying whether it is going to continue to support a Fascist party and a Criminal-Ridden armed forces and thus condemn this part of the world so close to their borders to terrible suffering, or whether the time of change has arrived in the United States . The policy toward El Salvador must be changed to achieve the goal of democracy so that pluralism will give way to democracy, justice, and peace . The United States can contribute to peace in El Salvador, but in order to do so it must change its policy."

According to unofficial returns released by the private television channels, which in previous elections have proven to be very similar to those of the National electoral court, Carlos Palenque , 45, a radio and television businessman and the leader of the conscience of the Fatherland, has received most of the votes .

Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada, the leader of the MNR, last night said on television:``We must be extremely serious in searching for a solution to this problem, or the people will turn their backs on populism .""he said his decision will be``a Christmas present .""he insisted, however, that in his opinion the governing Adn-Mir alliance``will easily fix things between them""because``They are two of a kind .""although the MNR was the party to receive most of the votes in the 7 may Presidential elections, it was due to an alliance between two old political enemies--the ADN and Mir--that Jaime Paz Zamora, who had come third in the elections, was installed as president of the Republic .``If we applied this same rule to the current problem ,""Sanchez de Losada said Jokingly,``Guido Capra would be elected .""Sanchez de Losada pointed out that Palenque was one of the supporters of the Adn-Mir governing alliance, which prevented Sanchez de Losada from becoming President . According to the opposition, Palenque's party gained the La Paz development Corporation and``half a Ministry""as a result of the alliance . Sanchez de Losada warned the Bolivian politicians that Palenque's populist group, which is growing very fast, has its eyes set``on the L993 Presidential elections, not only on the La Paz mayorship .""while respect was shown toward Ronald MacLean, the candidate most criticized by the MNR during the municipal elections campaign was Palenque . Palenque stated, however, that the Councilmen who on 2 January will elect the next Mayor of La Paz must``respect the will of the majority .""`` We hope that there will be no negotiation and that the desire of the majority will be respected ,""Palenque stated . He is well known, especially because of the beard he wears, which makes him look very much like former U.S. President Abraham Lincoln . Palenque, who is certain of the support he will receive from the only UCS Councilman in La Paz, fears that a pact between the Adn-Mir coalition and the MNR will prevent him from obtaining the mayorship of the most important city in the country . such an alliance, however, with a greater ideological basis than any other, will have to overcome the grudge that the MNR bears because the ADN and the Mir``had stolen from it""the Presidency of the Republic during the last elections, according to commentators .``We are going to be very responsible, and we are not going to be motivated by personal interests or by any vengeance ,""Sanchez de Losada stated, commenting on the negotiations that will take place to designate the Mayor of La Paz . like in La Paz, the government alliance will have to negotiate support in the other major Bolivian cities, where the coalition came in first but failed to win absolute majorities . The only exception is Sucre, where the candidate of the United left coalition, radio reporter Omar Montalvo, obtained 57.3 percent of the votes, which is sufficient to obtain the mayorship . The most outstanding points about the elections were the abstention of between 30 and 50 percent of the voters and the almost absolute normalcy during the elections . The state of siege decreed throughout the country on 15 November due to Street confrontations caused by social disturbances did not hamper the electoral process . The traditional restrictions, however, affected traffic and hampered public transportation, keeping voters from casting their votes . The abstention was also caused by the weariness of the voters, who are voting for the fourth time in 4 years."

These groups are organized by the state itself to get rid of its political opponents and these groups are equipped with all the resources required to engage in acts of impunity ,""said the Congress spokesperson . about 200 delegates from 12 Latin American countries and from European and U.S. human rights organizations are participating in the Ix Congress of the Latin American Federation of associations of relatives of missing Detainees that began today and will end on 30 November in Lima .

Sierra, the Chilean delegate and the President of the Chilean Association of relatives of missing people, said that there is no total number of missing people, but that more than 100,000 people have been reported missing throughout Latin America since 1981 .``This figure has increased at a frightening rate, and we regret that the largest numbers of cases have been reported in countries with democratic governments ,""she added . She said that``neither under a dictatorship nor under a democracy""has the problem of the missing Detainees been resolved because the government``always manage to talk its way out of investigating or Punishing.``argue that it is necessary to forget the past in order to build the present and that it is necessary to reconcile if peace is to prevail . But how can there be peace and reconciliation while extremely serious events like the massive killing of human beings continue ,""she added . Sierra regretted that``There is very strong press censorship, and, what is worse, a self-imposed censorship``in the countries where most missing Detainees have been reported . These situations always lead us to believe that it is the state that promotes this entire policy, that is to say, the use of state terrorism in countries where a state of law, courts, and established legal practices prevail, Sierra commented . In today's session, a member of the Peruvian delegation said that over the past 10 years at least 4,000 people, mostly peasants and Andean community leaders, who were``arrested by government officials who later denied it ,""have disappeared . The member of the Peruvian delegation said that, according to official figures, about 15,000 people have been killed as a result of political violence in Peru, and that a``negligible number""has been killed in clashes."

However, the agenda is being processed and although Costa Rica offered to host the meeting,``It is not interested in forcing the issue ,""he emphasized . madrigal added that what interests Costa Rica is to serve as a``bridge""for solving the conflict between Nicaragua and El Salvador, and finding some formula so that the Salvadoran and Nicaraguan governments will establish a dialogue with the rebels .

Nicaragua has been taken over by the Sandinist forces, which receive arms of all kinds . more arms than food, more instructors than agricultural experts, and more arms than Finance assistance for industrial development keep reaching Nicaragua . Nicaragua has become a distribution center for other countries who raise pirate flags, countries whose leaders know that the Soviet Union is interested in the five countries of the Isthmus . This is why the Soviet Union continually aids the Salvadoran guerrillas . The interruption of financial assistance and arms would entail failure of the struggle for power in Central America . over the course of the talks aboard Soviet and U.S . ships off Malta, Bush's position remained in accordance with the interests of both the U.S. and other Western countries . Many of these latter countries are threatened by radical and clandestine movements . We believe that the U.S. President has just taken firm steps toward a direct understanding with the Soviet Union . This means that the guerrillas movements in several American countries will have to consent to civilized dialogue so they can coexist with the majority of the population, who desire to live in peace, with work and dignity . El Salvador represents the most dangerous example of this intercontinental penetration . In this country operates a guerrilla movement heavily supplied with arms and ammunition . These rebels are militarily and otherwise trained for clandestine operations that sow terror in the threatened towns and villages . The Soviet Union supplies these arms through Cuba . Salvadoran President Cristiani expects the accords reached by the two world leaders to cut the supply of war materiel to the Fmln . This materiel has made it possible to kill thousands of Salvadorans . We will have waited for the passage of time to see if it is true that the supply of arms has ceased and that Nicaragua has stopped assisting the Fmln .

Apparently the other explosion occurred in a street near the Presidential Palace . There were two explosions occurring Consecutively but very close together, which is why it was felt so strongly . It initially felt like an earthquake: first the wave and then the explosion . all the residents in this central area of Bogota felt it . It is also said that the explosion could have occurred closer to the administrative Department of security, Das, which is located in the same area . The Das headquarters are just around the corner from the judicial branch offices in Palo Quemado . The strong explosion that was felt by all of us who work at this hour in the central Bogota area took place at 19th Carrera and 25th street in Palo Quemado . I repeat, two consecutive explosions occurred at 0735 in the center of Bogota . Here is some updated information: it was not two explosions, as we had Intially believed, but three explosions that occurred a few minutes ago in Bogota . one of them was in the Palo Quemado sector, as we have already reported, in the area where both the Bogota courts and Das are located . Another explosion occurred in the Southern part of Bogota at 14th Carrera and 28th Street South, apparently near an agrarian trust branch in the Barrio Gustavo Restrepo neighborhood . a third explosion occurred in the central area of Bogota . These three explosions in Bogota took place almost simultaneously, just a few seconds apart . We now have official figures of the explosion near the Das headquarters: seven persons were killed, more than 50 were wounded, and approximately 25 vehicles and at least 15 buildings--including the Das offices that were partially destroyed--were damaged . Initially, Das officials have estimated that a powerful bomb of more than 100 kg of dynamite placed in a truck was activated . The huge explosion caused the initial destruction of the front part of the Das headquarters, as well as a building where there was a hardware store, and the total destruction of six or seven other buildings . A crater 15 meters wide and 6 meters deep was created in 27th Carrera . Most of the victims of the explosion were in private vehicles and taxis, and only four were walking in the area when the explosion occurred at almost 0740 . officials say initially that there were 50 persons, hit by glass shards and flying pieces of vehicles, injured in the explosion . officials have indicated that it is possible that the number of victims will increase, as the attack against the Das headquarters was very strong .

This Scarecrow would do better to keep his mouth shut because he has no business meddling in Chile . a clear idea of Perestroyka and the other lessons that Gorbachev is teaching . He is probably thinking that Bolivia is about to fall into the hands of the Communists because those in the government there are leaning to the left, and that Chile will follow suit . So he figures that he, as a leftist, will have the chance to meddle in Chilean affairs . not so . Nobody except we Chileans will handle our affairs . The best thing this Castro can do is stay home . He already visited Chile; I met him and so did others . He spent a whole night talking to in Punta arenas when I met him . So he has nothing to do here .

939,DEV-MUC3-0940,SANTIAGO,,"Relations between Chile and Bolivia have been broken . What do you think is the best way to face Bolivia's demand for a sea outlet? first, Chile maintains a firm stand on this subject, a fact that must be clearly understood by the Chilean people and the rest of the world . Chile does not have any border conflicts with Bolivia . Our border with Bolivia has been ratified by an international treaty that was freely approved by our two countries . This treaty constitutes an obligatory norm for Chile and Bolivia . Second, according to this treaty, Chile has always been willing to grant Bolivia transportation facilities to ports on the Pacific coast . Third, in face of the Bolivian aspirations to obtain greater facilities or a new transit system, the first thing to be done is to reestablish diplomatic relations . This is a bilateral issue between Bolivia and Chile . It is not an hemispheric matter or a matter to be decided by international organizations . I trust that Bolivia and Chile will reestablish diplomatic relations in an atmosphere of friendship and cooperation . We must be aware that the world is heading toward integration and that it is more convenient for all of us to attain the best and most integrated relations possible . We must seek solutions and, as the Bolivian President recently stated, we must seek imaginative solutions with a 21st century and not a 19th century view . I hope that within this spirit we will manage not only to reestablish relations with Bolivia, but to establish satisfactory relations for the two countries . CHILEAN relations with the United States have not been excellent over the past few years, and the murder of Orlando Letelier is tied into this situation . What is your opinion on this subject, considering that a U.S. court has requested the Extradition of General Contreras and Colonel Espinoza? well, I hope that Chile will maintain the best relations possible with all the countries of the world, including the United States, a country with which we are linked for many reasons . I discussed this subject with people from U.S . diplomatic, political, and economic circles, and I have noted their willingness to improve relations and solve the problems that are currently separating us as soon as a democratic government is reestablished . I do not think that an Extradition will solve the Letelier case because it has already been ruled on by the Supreme Court . It is what we lawyers refer to as an adjudged matter . I think that Chile can demonstrate its willingness to help clarify the case and guarantee justice, as it is our purpose in all human rights problems, so as to satisfy the most demanding consciences of the world."

They will continue with indiscriminate terrorism and selective terrorism . We have here some of the first evidence . for example, the murder of a person useful to Salvadoran society like Dr Guerrero, the acts of sabotage against the electricity system, the destruction of public transportation . We can also mention the destruction of some gasoline stations . basically, what they seek is to systematically destroy the economy of the country, to provoke the closing of some industrial centers, and to bring about economic chaos . that is why, even though we believed we were taking risks in the military field of national defense, the armed forces changed the Curfew hours, so that Curfew hours are now from 2300 to 0500 . We did this believing that the economic aspect is very important for the country, and that is why we want to benefit the industrial, business, and farming sectors, so that they will be able to carry out their activities under almost normal conditions . We also considered that this time of the year we are picking coffee and cotton and harvesting sugarcane, and these are the three main staples of our economy . These activities are mainly carried out in the evening, and that is why we have changed the Curfew hours to benefit businessmen, workers, and farmers so they can support their families . Colonel, does the President think that during the Costa Rican meeting enough pressure can be exerted on Nicaragua so that it will suspend assistance to the Fmln and the war will diminish in the country? the cynicism of the dictator Ortega of the Sandinist government has been fully proven . in the previous meetings within the framework of Esquipulas II, he committed himself to discontinuing support for the Fmln . This total war offensive that has been inflicted upon the Salvadoran people should be suspended, because we are sure that the moment Nicaragua and Cuba--it is through those countries, rather those governments that the Communist bloc has been helping the Fmln--the Fmln would weaken tremendously . as a member of the armed forces, as a member of the high command, I feel very proud about the professional, determined, and courageous attitude with which the officers, non-commissioned officers, and troops of our Armed Forces have neutralized and defeated the Fmln offensive . In this regard, I believe that the opinions voiced by General Thurman are not really in line with what we have lived here inside the country."

They will not defeat us . We are and will continue struggling . The war has been declared on the entire country and on democracy . We will not fall under the control of the Narcoterrorists' bloody tyranny . last night, the country learned about the Colombian Chamber of Representatives's decision to approve the constitutional reforms with the inclusion of the Extradition issue in the referendum . The confirmation that the Avianca plane crash was caused by a bomb; the murder of Bernardo Jaramillo Uribe, roving 13th judge of criminal investigation; and this morning's atrocious attack on the Das facilities further proves that the decision made by the Chamber of Representatives is highly unsuitable for the entire country . We absolutely cannot accept drug traffickers trying to force our legislators to adopt a decision that would only bring more destruction and death to Colombia, because if the inclusion of the Extradition issue is approved in the referendum, it would not be a decision made by the sovereign will of the people, but by the force of bullets and terror . COLOMBIANS have Unfortunately paid too high a price to find out what these criminals really think . They spoke about a truce and then they murdered a judge . subsequently, the Chamber of Representatives approved the inclusion of the Extradition issue into the referendum and, in good faith, many people thought that was the first step toward peace with the drug traffickers . They were wrong . the next day the Das facilities were attacked . those actions prove what those criminals are capable of doing to obtain a favorable decision in the referendum . they do not conduct an election campaign, but a campaign of terror to attain their goals . I now reiterate what I said in my speech before leaving for Japan . I said that the constitutional reforms with the inclusion of the referendum is highly unsuitable . I share the sorrow and sadness of all my compatriots, especially victims' relatives . Our indignation must represent all COLOMBIANS' intention to join efforts and drop personal interests . compatriots, we must never, we will never succumb to the Narcoterrorists . The stable democracy we have built and defended with great effort for over 1 century is endangered . Throughout its history, Colombia has overcome more difficult times . Let us all stand up with faith, courage, and firmness to defend our homeland and freedom . Thank you very much."

He was initially scheduled to return around midnight on Saturday . President Barco told the international community today that in no way will Colombia accept the intervention of foreign troops to fight terrorism, violence, and organized crime . during a news conference with Japanese and foreign media representatives in Tokyo, president Barco also said that the liberal party will probably win the 1990 Presidential elections because it has capable people and it is the majority party . He also referred to a mid-air plane explosion--a terrorist action, in his words--and the attack perpetrated against the Das headquarters in Bogota with approximately 500 kg of explosives . President Barco will return to Bogota at 0900 on 9 December . He will depart from Narita airport, located 2 hours from Tokyo, meeting with Japanese investors and possible buyers of Colombian coffee . The event was organized by the Colombian coffee growers Association and the Gran Colombian merchant fleet's representatives in the Far East . approximately 2 weeks ago an airplane exploded when taking off from Bogota, and experts who came from many parts of the world have discovered that it was caused by a bomb placed on board rather than a problem of Pressurization . The other case is the attack which was perpetrated last night , 2 nights ago, against the intelligence headquarters of the national police . You have read or reported that a large amount...about 500 kg of dynamite placed in a truck exploded and caused the collapse or considerable damage of the general headquarters of the Colombian intelligence services .

Meanwhile, an attack carried out from the northern part of San Salvador led to Incursions in Soyapango, Mejicanos, and Ayutuxtepeque . In Ayutuxtepeque the Fmln carried out annihilation maneuvers against the 1ST infantry Brigade's Soriano Battalion, which was stationed on El Carmen Hill where we killed 15 soldiers and wounded 30 . Among these casualties is an officer from the 1ST infantry Brigade . The Fmln seized five M-16 rifles, one grenade launcher, , four M-60 Machineguns from the Annihilated troops . a military vehicle was partially destroyed, and an enemy patrol was totally destroyed .

He appealed to``the foreign powers""to halt their intervention in the Subregion . in a news conference broadcast over television for all the country, Perez today predicted that the coming Central American Presidents summit to be held in San Jose will fail if what he described as``foreign powers""do not halt military and financial support to the various factions fighting in the convulsed region . The Costa Rican, Nicaraguan, Guatemalan, Salvadoran, and Honduran Presidents will meet in San Jose shortly to find a solution to the Salvadoran conflict and reactivate the Esquipulas II and Tela pacification accords .``If the foreign powers, be they the United States, Cuba, the Soviet Union, or whatever, persist on disturbing a direct analysis and preventing a friendly agreement between the central American Presidents, this summit will come to nothing ,""Perez pointed out . Perez said that the recent Farabundo Marti National liberation front offensive in El Salvador interfered seriously with the regional pacification process . He requested that the Salvadoran government clarify the death of six Jesuits who were murdered by the death squads .``There is no doubt that the Salvadoran crisis occurred at an untimely moment, when things were going so well . The responsibility for this, however, rests heavily with the Fmln and those who gave arms to the rebels so they could carry out so major a military operation ,""he said . He added, however, that``the Salvadoran government is accountable for what happened to the six Jesuits, who were murdered in a lowly and wicked manner . This must be clarified also ,""he said . The Venezuelan President, who offered to Mediate in the Salvadoran conflict, said he reported to Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, the summit's host, the contents of a letter that the Fmln sent to Perez, in which the organization proposes a cease-fire with international verification . Perez asked the Salvadoran guerrillas to be more flexible because``the fate of all of Latin America is at stake .""referring directly to the San Jose summit--he said he was instrumental in choosing Costa Rica as site for the meeting--Perez assumed an``optimistic yet concerned""stance with regard to the meeting's results . He finally said:``This San Jose summit will make things conform to Esquipulas II and Tela if the central American Presidents are left alone and particularly if they know that none of them will be backed by any one power with arms or money .

According to the Das director, a Spanish terrorist and Eta member who could have advised the COLOMBIANS on the preparation of the car bomb has been identified . Das director general Miguel Maza Marquez attended the funeral of his subordinates and fellow workers who were killed as a result of an explosion in front of the Das facilities . at the end of the religious ceremony, Gen Maza said that he does not rule out the possibility that foreign terrorists participated in the attempt on his life . There are indications that this could be so, because the methods and system used to fabricate the car bomb lead us to believe that they were experts in this type of activity .

948,DEV-MUC3-0949,LIMA,1989-12-07,"President Alan Garcia announced that the borders will be reopened . He said that the results of the measures adopted 15 days ago are positive . The President called on all businessmen and industrialists not to speculate on prices . He also reiterated his support for economy and Finance Minister Cesar Vasquez Bazan, who he said is making great efforts to face the Peruvian economic situation . Garcia made these statements after a meeting with the Council of ministers . The border closure measure expires today . will it be extended? no, the borders were never closed . We only established some restrictions on the use of transit permits in Tacna to prevent an increase of smuggling before the year-end festivities . The 15-Day term of that measure has expired, and it will not be extended . apparently, that measure has not had good results . I think that in general it has yielded positive results because smuggling has probably decreased somewhat . As you know, a few years ago Chile established the Iquique free zone where products are sold to Peru and Bolivia . Thus a stable market of hundreds of thousands of people which daily pass thorough the Tacna border with small packages has been established . We simply restricted the permits they use to bring in a tape recorder or laser disc players . I understand that smuggling decreased for a few days . However, that merchandise entered the country by other means . We cannot impose too many restrictions, but we can ask the customs office and the police to increase their efforts to control excessive smuggling into the country . do you think that the free-market dollar will drop by January? I am sure it will . Last year, like now, the Free- market dollar exchange rate increased sharply because companies are paying year-end bonuses and they are converting their profits into dollars . people are taking holiday trips and buying more goods and home appliances . Therefore, the dollar demand and prices have increased . Last year, when the Muc dollar exchange rate was at 500 intis to a dollar, the free-market dollar climbed to 2,000 intis . later it dropped to 1,000 intis in January . I think that the same thing will happen this year . There have been some rumors in the past few days that the economy Minister is about to resign or is being pressured to resign . is this true? the only person who could pressure him is the President of the Republic, and I can tell you that I am not pressuring him . We acknowledge the current difficulties of the Peruvian economy as well as the efforts of the economy Minister . I express my recognition of and support for the economy Minister because he is young, well-intentioned, and very honest; he has progressive ideas . He is making every effort possible to stabilize the economy as well as possible, and he sponsored a Democratic transition after the elections . Today did the Council of ministers discuss a wage increase for this month? that point must be defined by the economy and labor ministers . today, in addition to the border issue, we discussed a subject we had talked about a few weeks ago . on that occasion I listened to a report from the so-called commander Huaihuacu . He is chief of some 85 peasant communities along the Apurimac river which have rebelled against shining path control . The Apurimac River separates the Ayacucho and Cusco departments, and these peasants live in an area called Oreja de Perro in La Mar province . They have carried out a Democratic uprising and organized themselves to keep shining path from entering their communities . This so-called commander Huaihuacu, who is a man of action, has organized approximately 85 communities on the banks of the Apurimac River, in Ayacucho province of La Mar and the Cusco District of Charate . Huaihuacu has come to Lima seeking support . We have decided with the defense Ministry to go tomorrow to Rinconada Baja area in La Mar province, shining path's primary area of activity for 10 years . There I will dedicate a radio station to be called radio Democracia . its aim will be to broadcast news and democratic and patriotic messages from that area which is a center of peasant resistance against terrorism . We will arrive there tomorrow and talk with the peasant leaders who for years have fought shining path together with our Navy infantry units stationed in Luisiana and San Francisco."

The Urng general command expresses its strong solidarity and deep admiration for the Salvadoran people and their VANGUARD, the Fmln, who with great heroism and determination are writing one of the most glorious pages of its history . We view with profound indignation how the officers of La Tandona and the arena government headed by Cristiani, in view of their inability to defeat, repel, or contain the heroic Fmln, have decided to continue massive bombings against defenseless civilians, sow death and destruction, and commit Massacres . The Cristiani government and the Salvadoran armed forces, which are desperate due to the victorious advances of the Fmln forces--which have not only maintained, but expanded their positions in San Salvador and the rest of the territory of that Fraternal country--have lost control . With vengeance in their minds, they have begun to implement a number of criminal actions against all those identified with the just struggles of the majority . At dawn on 16 November, six Jesuit priests and two humble women who worked for them were brutally assassinated .

We know that around the capital there are still groups of terrorists, especially in the Southern area, in the Northwest--the San Salvador volcano--and in the northeast, to the North of Soyapango Muncipality . The military, however, have taken the offensive in these three areas where the Fmln groups have been chased . fighting has taken place over the last few days, with over 100 casualties inflicted upon the Fmln in 3 days .``We believe, however, they have left within the capital great numbers of weapons, some of which have been discovered . Some groups are in hiding, using civilians, and are carrying out terrorist activities . They have burned buses, gasoline stations and murdered Dr Francisco Jose Guerrero; and on 7 December, they fired three or four mortar rounds at random, falling on private homes . one of them fell on the House of the Supreme Court of justice President . We believe these actions are just mere terrorism, Indiscriminately firing mortars on the capital's civilians .``We believe they have no further capacity except to carry out these terrorist acts to create confusion and anarchy among the civilian population . Thank God, our population is very brave and heroic . We have been noticing with pride how the population has been working normally in all of San Salvador, going to their jobs, with businesses opening and trying to operate normally . There are still some threats in the city of San Miguel, where a group of terrorists are concentrated to the northeast of the city . Here, too, the armed forces have begun an offensive and quickly end any imminent danger .""President Cristiani said that the government's position at the 10 December Presidential summit will be open to the possibility of restarting a dialogue with the insurgents on 20 December, in Caracas, Venezuela, as long as the Fmln no longer carries out armed actions in urban areas, but they do not have to lay down their weapons and should continue actions only against military targets .``as you all have been able to see for yourselves, the government has never been against continuing the dialogue process to find a political solution to the Salvadoran conflict . It has been the Fmln that unilaterally broke this dialogue process by not turning up at Caracas, Venezula, as had been agreed in San Jose, Costa Rica . We, however, are going to make a definite proposal in Costa Rica, which in general terms is as follows:``the Salvadoran government is willing to restart the dialogue process . Most convenient would be for this to take place in Caracas, with the following condition: begining 15 December , 3 days after the central American Presidential meeting, the Fmln should publicly declare and give proof of compliance that it will end all types of terrorist acts, especially those that directly or indirectly affect civilians . We want to clarify that we are not asking them to lay down their arms, as was attempted many times . If the Fmln continues its irrational behavior, the armed forces will continue fighting them . terrorist actions against civilians must end . The people do not deserve to continue being the most affected by the irrationality of all this fighting . We think the least the Fmln can do is to stop all actions that affect, directly or indirectly, the civilian population . military targets are something else; but if we analyze things, up to this moment not a single military objective was the target since 11 November . They have not even been able to take over a civil defense post . All actions have been against civilians, trying to intimidate them, trying to create terror among the population . The cessation of terrorist acts should be the Fmln's proof of sincerity and will to really try and seek a solution by way of dialogue . If the Fmln today ACCEPTS ending all actions against the civilian population, then we are willing on 20 December to go to Caracas and to continue the dialogue process and talks on all the topics the Fmln wishes to talk about . Thjis will be in order to ensure that by 15 February we have a solution to the conflict . ''"

However, when eyewitness Lucia Barrera de Cerna first testified, she clearly described the men as being dressed as soldiers and not as guerrillas . I believe that it is easy to distinguish between one way of dressing and another .""it seems that the plan is to lead the investigation through other paths, and that is why the U.S. officials took the eyewitness to the United States,``where she was given an authentic brainwashing and threatened with deportation if she did not tell the truth .""according to the Jesuits' lawyer, Scott Grathead, Mrs. Cerna was subjected to an``aggressive and violent""questioning session . After this psychological torment, she thought it over and retracted her statement . Fortunately, once rid of the pressure from her``protectors ,""she has Retaken the path of truth . in his Homily today, the Archbishop denounced the United States for treating the witness differently once she arrived in the United States, instead of protecting her like the U.S. Embassy officials in San Salvador had promised, knowing that the humble working woman``freely and sincerely had declared what she had seen and heard the night of the horrible massacre .""the Jesuit priests were murdered on the morning of 16 November . referring to the statement made by the nation's attorney general, who said that the church has refused to cooperate with the investigation of the murder of the Jesuit priests--a Lawyer-Priest had been appointed to cooperate with the investigation--the Archbishop said that this statement is not only false but also malicious . in his Homily today the Prelate said that, in the first place, it the laymen's ground, and that is where they should prove their expertise and moral integrity . They should Imbue the exercise of their profession with evangelical values . The Archbishop said that, in the second place,``it could be a trap .""he added that the church is not going to endorse with a clergyman's presence something that is already beginning to be``murky .""the church and other sectors linked to the investigation in an independent way have been Distrustful ever since the Attorney General's office showed its attitude toward Lucia Barrera de Cerna's testimony . She was Testifying at the Spanish Embassy before lawyers and ambassadors, and as the Curfew hour approached, they took the witness to another embassy . the next day two district attorneys came to harass the witness with questions . The Archbishop once again rejected the Attorney General's accusation . He reiterated the belief that the armed forces were guilty of the murders . He said,``I am not making any accusations . However, the church is very annoyed, and although I am not saying that we are the object of official persecution, within the framework of this regime there is persecution in other sectors . ''"

We appointed Costa Rican foreign minister Rodrigo madrigal Nieto as our spokesman . He said what we had agreed to say at that time . In fact, there is not much more to report now . Foreign Minister madrigal Nieto told you yesterday that the foreign ministers had basically devoted their time to examining three topics . We also had two more topics, but in all there were three topics . I think he mentioned the Contras' demobilization, the internal situation in El Salvador, and a third topic, but right now I do not dare to say what it was lest I make a mistake . He mentioned Onuca . that is correct . In fact, we discussed five topics, but if he said...Onuca was one of them . So we have demobilization, the situation in El Salvador, and Onuca . The central American Presidents devoted their time to these three topics . This was not so easy . Some say the thing to do is to clearly and categorically condemn the Fmln for...and to describe it as a terrorist group . others say: Let us condemn terrorism in general, and also anyone who uses it . Some attach a great deal of importance to what International organizations specializing in defending and promoting respect for human rights say, namely organizations like amnesty International, America's watch, the Geneva-based International League of Jurists, the OAS' Inter-American Committee on human rights, the UN human rights Commission, the UN's task force on forced Disappearances, and the international relations Catholic Institute in London, England . all these organizations, which undoubtedly from the Nicaraguan standpoint deserve respect and credibility, indicate matters are not simply black and white."

968,DEV-MUC3-0969,MANAGUA,1989-03-20,"The murder of three journalists in El Salvador yesterday once again shows the repressive and criminal nature of the Salvadoran Army . those actions against our press colleagues are only comparable with actions carried out by the armies in Chile, Paraguay, and other military Dictatorships . The Somozist Army committed similar crimes in Nicaragua . We just have to remember the cold way in which U.S . journalist bill Stewart was killed while covering the last phase of the insurrection in Managua's Western neighborhoods . In El Salvador, foreign and national journalists are demanding a serious investigation from President Duarte's government to punish the military men responsible for the crime . will the Army's high command be willing to conduct the investigation? we doubt it, based on its lack of willingness to rectify things in the past regarding other cases, such as the assassination of Msgr Romero and the murder of Herbert Anaya, president of the human rights Commission . After all, that is the way in which Napoleon Duarte's Christian Democratic government restrains freedom of expression in his country . more than 11 journalists have been killed by the Salvadoran Army since 1981 . Meanwhile, in Nicaragua, journalists from independent media are concerned about 39 former Somozist guards who are still in jail because of their criminal records, to the point of launching journalistic campaigns demanding from the government the release of the harmless pigeons . What will they say now about the Salvadoran Army, which murdered their colleagues who were complying with their duty to inform the public? will they defend them as they defended the Somozist guards? they probably will . They will try to play down the action, because they have lost their dignity, good sense, and professional pride a long time ago."

We mean civilian fishing boats . I will tell you what happened . We have very few patrol boats on the Atlantic Coast and our boats there are in charge of protecting Nicaragua's sovereignty and wealth . for many years, the Nicaraguan Air force and the Sandinist Navy have been conducting joint operations . In other words, this is not the first time we have conducted such operations . Furthermore, we have taped most of those operations because they require thorough training and accuracy . During those operations, helicopters have deployed men who board most of the ships participating in the operations . In other words, helicopters follow the ships as they move along and then special Sandinist Navy forces board the ship from the air . I will tell you what happened more or less . On 7 December 1989 we conducted an operation, basically because since November, we have detected over 30 pirate ships, in other words, ships that have neither license nor permit to fish in Nicaraguan territorial waters . During an operation of the type I just described, our forces boarded three boats at 1020 on 7 December . The operation was carried out approximately 45 miles east of Puerto Cabezas . In other words, the three boats were boarded in this area here . . The names of the boats are``Kerry Mac II"",``Davis Jr ,""`` Miss patsy ,""and another one called``tie water"". The boats were captured and taken to Isla del Maiz . In each boat there were five Nicaraguan soldiers, one Air Force officer, and one Navy officer . as the boats were taken to Isla del Maiz, the members of the``Miss patsy""crew, who numbered approximately 60, Mutinied against the Sandinist officers on board . The ship's captain and a cook disarmed one of the soldiers and killed him . as a result of the confrontation, the cook was killed, but the captain was unharmed . after the mutiny was over, and at approximately 0.7 miles from corn, I mean Isla del Maiz, the ship's captain ran the``Miss patsy""fishing boat aground on some Reef near Isla del Maiz Grande and we were forced to, let us say, save all the people on board and take them to corn Island . one of the``Miss patsy""sailors jumped off the ship and we have been unable to find him . of the two bodies, that of the Army officer and the cook, we have only been able to recover the cook's body because the ship sank . Most of the other people were taken to hospitals in Bluefields and others are being held by the Sandinist Navy . that is more or less what happened .

The results of the Presidents' meeting has allowed us to measure the depth of the crisis in El Salvador and the impact of the Fmln's current military offensive, inasmuch as the summit's entire effort was aimed at saving the Salvadoran government from an extreme political and military crisis and from international isolation in exchange for a new promise on the immediate demobilization of the Nicaraguan Contras . 2 . The Fmln Indignantly rejects the Presidents' declaration because, contrary to the Dynamics of the entire international community, the clamor of democratic and social forces, and the clamor of churches in the country, this declaration unconditionally supports the leading Violator of human rights in the region, a government that has murdered and persecuted the clergy and bombed the civilian population . This support encourages those who have unleashed that irrational violence and allows more murders in El Salvador . 3 . The San Jose agreement does not contribute toward a negotiated solution in El Salvador . The Fmln cannot be disbanded as the result of agreements between governments because the Fmln constitutes a genuinely popular power throughout the Salvadoran territory, a force that the huge U.S.-Financed war machine has not been able to stop in 10 years . 4 . As has already been said in private, the Fmln agrees with UN Secretary General Javier Perez' mediation to initiate serious negotiations with the participation of all of the country's political and social forces . 5 .

971,DEV-MUC3-0972,SAN SALVADOR,,"In the case of El Salvador, this is not a matter of the irregular group being around San Salvador, in Guasapa, or in Chalatenango--wherever they may want to operate . We believe that the demobilization process is applicable if the group ceases to be an irregular group, something that no longer has any justification, to become a political or a civic group in the framework of a legal process . The message here is that the Presidents no longer want or justify irregular groups in the region, and irregular groups have no reason for continuing in the region . This includes the Nicaraguan resistance, the Fmln, and other groups, such as those that may exist in Guatemala . If Guatemala were to ask that a problem in that sister country be considered, we would have to consider it because it is the same situation . support and verification by the United Nations and the OAS is requested through an organization known as Ciav . The first thing to do is to cease terrorist activities, to initiate the dialogue process, and then to be Demobilized and to become a legal group that would function in the framework of Salvadoran laws . Maria Dolores Arguiaq, from radio Nacional, Spain . continuing with the Nicaragua parallelism, is there the possibility of having a cease-fire before or after the Venezuela meeting as a first step toward other measures that could put an end to the war? my other question is: the United Nations has been explicitly asked to prepare the Reinitiation of the dialogue . has there been any preparation? has the church made any preparations in this regard? well, that has nothing to do with that . an end of hostilities is basically like saying: do not carry out terrorist activities against the civilian population . It is better to define meanings and not to use terms that create problems of Semantics . What is your second question? logically . somebody else has asked me also if we have had any contact with the Fmln . This agreement was signed at 0400 . At 0700 we got on a plane and here we are now . We have not had time to speak with Mr Perez de Cuellar, much less with the Fmln . But this information will be passed to the United Nations because there is much to be asked of the United Nations . We have been confronted with the pleasant surprise that representatives of the UN observer group in Central America are already in the country, to be installed . Mr Ortega, who had gone there with the position that as long as the resistance is not Demobilized he would not accept Onuca, had to abandon that position because it was irrational, and Onuca will be asked to go to Nicaragua immediately . The agreement will be reported to Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar . He will also receive from El Salvador a request that he work in favor of Reinitiating the dialogue process . The agreement has special contents . It does not mention other countries by name because the central American Presidents have tried to produce a document that is very respectful of countries from outside this area, but it is undeniable that there are States that are negatively affecting the situation in Central America . The United Nations and the UN Secretary General, especially and personally, are being asked to help make States that meddle in the region see that they must help the peace process promoted by the central American Presidents . Obviously I do not have to mention the names of the countries to which I am referring . It is necessary to understand that we are trying to find a real solution, to see that all the factors that have been exerting influence, whether negative or positive, work in a positive way . The United Nations, which comprises all these States, is in a better position to carry out this work."

Therefore, in our opinion, he has no option other than to accept the reality of what is happening in Central America, or see himself totally isolated amid a peace plan that has international support . This situation would cause him many problems and headaches in political and diplomatic matters . He could do nothing but accept the reality . He could no longer defend the position that the Nicaraguan resistance was something special and the Fmln was something else and was justifiable . It is now clear that he has run out of tricks and has had to accept what all the remaining four Central American Presidents are aware of and defended at the Costa Rican summit . Now, if in their strategy they sold out the Fmln, as has been mentioned here, they will have to give some explanations to their Fmln friends . that is a problem between him and the Fmln . What should be of interest to us is that the Fmln's violent and terrorist actions are no longer justified from any point of view . This has been clearly and strongly emphasized in the Costa Rican agreement . In this regard, I repeat that the Salvadoran government is willing to resume the dialogue process from which the Fmln unilaterally withdrew . However, at this time it is necessary for the Fmln to openly promise--and this is strongly demanded by the central American Presidents, including the Nicaraguan President--it will cease terrorist actions, especially those affecting civilians . Obviously a total demobilization and return to the democratic process--with the guarantees that must be given to the Fmln members--will be the result of the dialogue process . This is how we understand and view this matter . The demobilization of the Nicaraguan resistance shall be the result of a convincing effort by the Nicaraguan government, which should provide the necessary guarantees . in the same document, the Sandinist government has unilaterally vowed to ensure those guarantees . It is also important to point out that the central American Presidents asked the United Nations to also join the Ciav, so the Ciav begins and implements the process to Demobilize the Fmln . This is basically the desire of the central American Presidents . If the Fmln wants to gain political advantages, it should pursue this within the democratic process because it can no longer be justified and has never been justified . However, today we strongly tell the Fmln that no longer is there any room in Central America, and especially in El Salvador, for violent and terrorist actions."

How can the Reestablishment of the relations be achieved? point 12 of this declaration makes a Fraternal call to El Salvador and Nicaragua to seek the Normalization of the diplomatic and consular relations through dialogue and negotiations . We made the decision to temporarily suspend the relations with Nicaragua because of the flagrant violation of the Esquipulas agreements . They were directly supporting the Fmln's terrorist aggression . In Costa Rica we gave them a document that clearly defines El Salvador's position regarding possible negotiations which could normally reestablish the diplomatic and consular relations . This document was not discussed by the five Presidents because it only concerned two of us . However, the document was given to the Nicaraguan delegation and we will wait for the results . We believe that in general terms it could stop Nicaragua's interference and its support for the Fmln . Maria Cortina from Notimex . Cortina words indistinct...to immediately initiate the dialogue process . In addition, they have to publicly stop conducting actions against the civilian population . that was part of the proposal you made here on Saturday . However, I am not yet clear on something . to initiate the dialogue process, does the Fmln have to declare a cease-fire or would a public declaration be enough? well, we maintain the position we stated on 10 December . We believe that point 3 of this declaration UPHOLDS what we have been doing all along regarding the search for a peaceful solution in the Salvadoran conflict . The central American Presidents want the Fmln to publicly state that they will immediately suspend all the violent actions that are directly or indirectly affecting the civilian population . We believe that it is not enough to make a public statement . They must keep their word . We believe that there should at least be a 5-day period between the public statement and the beginning of a dialogue . We maintain the position, that is the central American Presidents and myself, that no hostile actions by the Fmln are justifiable . We believe that the Fmln should stop carrying out all hostile actions in the country . This indicates two things which must be understood . First, the Fmln are the only ones conducting hostile actions . The government and the democratic institutions that belong to it do not generate hostilities . They simply respond to the actions of armed groups that are interested in making trouble and overthrowing a legitimate government . The government has the constitutional right to a legitimate defense and to the preservation of national security in favor of the Salvadoran people, as the Constitution States . Secondly, the Fmln has lost all maneuvering options . The central American Presidents said it clearly when they stated that the Fmln had no justification for their violent actions in El Salvador . that is why we are once again asking for an immediate and effective cease-fire . These were the same words used at the summit held in Tela, Honduras . However, I repeat, we will maintain the position we had before, even though we totally agree with this document."

The Nicaraguan President insisted on the``great responsibility""of the U.S. government in the fulfillment of the agreements, particularly with regard to the points that deal with the demobilization of the``Contras""stationed in Honduras .

977,DEV-MUC3-0978,SAN SALVADOR,,"And again, because the central American Presidents did not want to state these countries by name, I will refrain myself from doing it at this time, but they are very obvious, who and what they . But I think obviously it would be much easier if the Fmln would act rationally and accept that they have no longer any recognition for what they do, and that they have been condemned, and not only as an irregular force or group . They have now been condemned as being a terrorist group, which is the second aspect of the third point in the agreement . Therefore, maybe they should start thinking about something else . Maybe the Virgin of Guadalupe, whose anniversary we celebrate today, and who is the Guardian of all the American countries, will shine some light on these irrational people . They might see this as a very clear sign that they can no longer justify or lie, or try to convince people that what they do is good . that is not what the central American Presidents are looking for . They are looking for a political solution to the problem and all their efforts are directed in that way . Ana Aranda from the Miami Herald . If the government at any point confronted Nicaragua or whether the government as such was truly involved in sending weapons to the Fmln? well, he was watching some of the Videotapes that I took . We were watching them with the other central American Presidents . after a few minutes, he said he had some telephone calls to make and he got up and left . Obviously he could not justify what he was seeing and what the other Presidents were witnessing there on the TV screen . There was some confrontation with Ortega Obviously, but I will, you know, will say that I did not mind where the warehouse was or where they come from . It is simply the fact that they were at some point in time in Nicaragua and Nicaragua was sending them over to El Salvador . whether they came from the Soviet Union or whether they bought them from somewhere else, or wherever they came from, it really makes no difference . within the central American peace plan, the problem is that they are coming through Nicaragua with the knowledge of the Nicaraguan government, and that is a violation of the agreement . What could he say? no, he came out trying to produce some sort of dust over the issue--like we call it here--through his Minister of foreign relations . He was accusing Costa Rica of sending aid to the Nicaraguan resistance . and maybe he thought to divert the attention from the Salvadoran case by trying to say that Costa Rica was sending weapons to the Nicaraguan resistance . Then obviously he accused everybody of sending weapons to Nicaragua . The point is, first of all, he did not convince any of the other four Presidents . that is for sure . and there were no arguments he made in front of the press or at any point in time where they denied that they have been helping the Fmln . I mean, it is very clear and obvious that they have helped the Fmln not since November 11 . all the weapons that were already here by November 11 also came through Nicaragua . Ricardo Clemens from Visnews . case of Jennifer Casolo there was a series of legislative issues that are not very clear and there is some kind of impasse regarding her trial . will the executive branch help to accelerate the trial, or will it issue some kind of pardon or something like that? no, the executive branch cannot interfere with the judicial process of any person in the country . It would have to be the Supreme Court or the Judiciary that deals with the problem . They have to decide what the law is and what the application of the law should be . Our position is that the law should be applied Impartially, and everything that the judge or anybody else does in the state should be done within the legal framework . But we have no possibility of intervening in the Judiciary process . There is a separation of powers between the executive branch and the judicial branch . Thank you, Mr President . Thank you, gentlemen . Thank you all."

980,DEV-MUC3-0981,MANAGUA ,1989-12-13,".... I was in San Jose, Costa Rica at a meeting of central American Presidents . This meeting was of urgent nature to discuss issues such as El Salvador, Nicaragua, the Contras' demobilization, and human rights . at this meeting, we held in-depth discussions of problems that are being experienced in the central American countries, especially the situation being experienced in neighboring El Salvador, which is facing an internal conflict--more than a decade of continued war and internal conflict . El Salvador has been subjected to a very strong confrontation, which lately has worsened . As you all know, the civilian population, the clergy, nuns, and Union and labor leaders have been victims of this tragic situation . at this meeting, Nicaragua stated its position that the situation in El Salvador must be resolved through negotiation and not by way of violence . This position fully coincides with the position the Fmln has defended . On various occasions the Fmln has made peace proposals and it has called for negotiated solutions to the Salvadoran conflict and for real negotiations . following a lengthy and intense discussion of the Salvadoran issue, we came to an agreement, not only with regard to general please and statements concerning the situation in the neighboring Central American country, but on very specific issues that could lead to solution of the Salvadoran conflict . Thus, in point three, the five Presidents decided to request that the UN Secretary General make a very special personal effort to bring about a dialogue between the Salvadoran government and the Fmln, thereby contributing toward the talks' successful development . Nicaragua has thus supported the negotiated solution the Fmln has vigorously and consistently called for, and with which the government headed by President Cristiani also claims to agree . Such negotiation would lead to a dialogue process that would Resulte in solving the Salvadoran conflict . Likewise, we underscored human rights in Central America, because these rights are systematically violated in certain countries . This has been clearly stated at International organizations . I am especially worried about the human rights situation in El Salvador, where six Jesuit priests were recently murdered, and where the Army has been accused of exerting indiscriminate repression against the people, through aerial as well as artillery and infantry attacks . This human rights issue is worrisome to the central American people, the international community, and especially to Nicaragua . We also reached an agreement by which the central American Presidents insisted on the need for respect of human rights . In accordance with the Esquipulas II agreements, the central American Presidents ratified their pledges to fully respect human rights, including the civilian, political, economic, social, and cultural rights established in their respective Constitutions, and in signed and ratified international agreements . Nicaragua's position has not wavered; it has maintained its positions that the central American countries are willing to have recognized International human rights organizations in our respective countries, and help defend human rights in Central America . There are forces, Central American armies especially, among them the Salvadoran Army--which has organized death squads that systematically murder Salvadoran people--whose governments and Presidents are faced with certain limitations in overcoming the problem of human rights violations . This, I believe, is where the greatest strength must be exerted and the greatest effort made to disband the death squads so that human rights can be respected, a peaceful solution can be found for all the conflicts in these countries, and a worsening of violence can be avoided, especially since this violence is on the increase because of the injustice that prevails in these countries due to a lack of equity, freedom, and justice, which is at the root of the problem."
981,DEV-MUC3-0982,GUATEMALA CITY,1989-12-13,"President Vinicio Cerezo has referred to the possibility of a dialogue between government representatives and members of the Guatemalan national revolutionary unity, Urng, clearly stating that the possibility of a dialogue with that organization has been discussed . He added that the Urng must first state that it is willing to peacefully participate in the dialogue . The Guatemalan President added that the rebels must understand Tha they cannot talk about dialogue when Perpetrating acts of treason against the central American people, meaning placing bombs and Perpetrating acts of terrorism . The Urng must decide to suspend its terrorist actions if it wants to hold a dialogue, he said . Cerezo added that there is a political opportunity for all the ideologies in Guatemala . Cerezo Arevalo added that if the Urng members wish to hold a dialogue, they may do so . In fact, he said, if they want to return to the country we can discuss the security conditions--but they must publicly state their decision to return in peace . Otherwise, the President added, it would be tantamount to giving the other, right-wing, terrorists, who attack students, engage in kidnapping, and place bombs, the right to participate in an internal dialogue . The Urng must decide if it wants to join us . They must do it peacefully because that is the proper thing . The people are Fed up with violence and war, he said . President Vinicio Cerezo referred to the central American Parliament's future during the news conference, held at the Guatemalan Air Force's installations upon his return to the country from Costa Rica . He said that the San Isidro declaration signed by the five central American Presidents included two impressive decisions . He said that they signed an agreement on the central American Parliament--each country may decide on its contribution as it sees fit--a subject which had delayed the signature of the appropriate documents . In addition, the Ecology and development Commission will begin to operate because they believe that its efforts will help consolidate peace and democracy in the area."
982,DEV-MUC3-0983,HAVANA ,1989-12-13,"Montenegro, we would like to know if the the Farabundo Marti National liberation front will continue with the current military offensive that began on 11 November since the agreement among the central American Presidents was signed? the truth is that the reasons why the Fmln began its offensive on 11 November 1989 have not changed at all . Thus, the Fmln cannot stop its offensive . on the contrary, what happened in El Salvador is that the Fmln offensive strategically turned the war . that turn included a number of military, political, and diplomatic implications . Thus, the truth is that the agreement signed in San Isidro de Coronado did not propose realistic negotiations for the conflict . yesterday , 12 December, the Fmln issued a communique which vehemently expressed its absolute rejection of the agreement signed at the Presidential summit . At present, the Fmln believes that despite what the other four Central American Presidents say, it is clearer than ever that the Salvadoran government is a Fascist, military dictatorship . The Salvadoran government violates people's human rights and that fact has been clearly proved to the entire international community . Therefore, any attempt to help the Salvadoran government or any kind of support given to it nothing but a piece of paper that does not have too much validity to the Fmln . In other words comrade, the Fmln will maintain the same level of confrontation with the dictatorship? I believe the Fmln's armed struggle is now more legitimate than ever . The summit confirmed the legitimacy of the Fmln's struggle, because the agreement resulting from that summit is neither feasible nor real . The Fmln will therefore continue its political - military offensive . The Fmln will increase its actions . The Fmln is reorganizing its political - military apparatus . in the next few days, we will clearly show what the Fmln can do . The Fmln will not surrender its weapons, especially now . The Fmln has no obligation to abide by an agreement that does not reflect the Salvadoran reality at all . If the central American Presidents chose to close their eyes to what is going on that is really their problem . two days after the end of the central American summit, what is the current military situation in El Salvador? as I told you earlier in answering the first question, the first thing is that the Fmln definately changed the war . This means that the Fmln made the Salvadoran armed forces retreat from the mountains to the heart of the cities including the capital city of San Salvador . At present, we have almost absolute control over the highways in 14, I mean 12 Salvadoran departments . There have been actions in Ahuachapan and Sonsonate, two departments that had been almost untouched by the war . There is a strategic siege in San Salvador . The Army has 65 percent of its forces stationed in San Salvador . The Army has abandoned large areas . As for sabotage operations, at present there are 10 110,000-Volt primary lines that are out of service . that represents a 40-Percent energy deficit in the country . There have been long periods of 100-Percent power outages in San Salvador . It is very unlikely that the government can control that situation . We do not know how long they will endure it . But in any case, a strong blow by the Fmln forces is expected to occur somewhere in El Salvador at any time."
983,DEV-MUC3-0984,CLANDESTINE,1989-12-13,"We could say that to a great extent the Declaration is full of pretty words, similar to those Cristiani uses, in the parts where the Declaration calls on the Fmln to join the alleged democratic process and says that the Salvadoran government is legitimate . However, if we look carefully, we can see what is behind the words and that in addition to declaring support for the government, an attempt is made to do the Salvadoran Army a favor . This is done by asking the Fmln to stop all violent actions that directly or indirectly affect the civilian population . We know that this is how the government refers to Sieges on cities, to transportation strikes, and to sabotage, the Army's most serious sources of concern . Underneath this declaration is a request for the Fmln to leave the cities because the Army can no longer stand the situation and feels it is near collapse . The declaration does not state any concern for bombings because considering the condition in which the government is now, any statement in this regard would be like adding fuel to the fire . The declaration is like a walking stick to keep the dictatorship up, and, as the Fmln general command has stated in a communique, it is evidence of the political and military crisis in which this government has been placed as a result of the offensive carried out by all of you . to conclude: Let us wait and see if this declaration will save Cristiani from international isolation . It is important to take into consideration what the general command has stated in its communique, that the agreements by governments that do not know the true situation in our country and that serve other interests cannot Demobilize the Fmln because the Fmln enjoys popular support throughout the nation . The Fmln is not like the Contras who are in Honduras and international organizations can go to their camps to Demobilize them . In El Salvador the situation is very different . Cristiani himself was unable to answer a journalist who asked him if he was going to Demobilize the Fmln in San Salvador, in Guazapa, in Chalatenango, and Morazan . The Costa Rica declaration is neither realistic nor viable . This is something that the international community is already pointing out . an international television network has said that following this declaration, the Esquipulas agreement could become just words . A journalist has asked how much this alleged International victory of Cristiani is going to last . Meanwhile, the Archbishop of Guatemala has said that he does not expect anything good from the meeting because neither the Contras nor the Fmln were present . The reaction to the results of the Presidential summit are along these lines . The truth is that true facts are what counts . words and paper are always defeated by facts . The truth is that the Army keeps bombing and that genocide will always be condemned . The truth is that your efforts, comrades, will not cease until the dictatorship is definitely defeated."

When a U.S. Newswoman approached him for an interview, Pinochet, irritated, asked her what she was doing putting her nose in here; he told her that this is our problem, not yours, intruders . Pinochet then turned to the local newsmen and told them that he is unhappy with Chileans for allowing foreign observers to enter the country . I am unhappy with Chileans because they have lost their feeling of nationality by accepting the presence of a bunch of outsiders who have come to look over what we are doing . What do they think they are doing? let me tell you something else: these outsiders are here to check on the way in which their money has been invested by the political parties and these gentlemen . as he was leaving the voting site, Pinochet told a Uruguayan correspondent that the observers are intruders . Interior Minister Carlos Caceres affirmed that the situation around the country remains normal and orderly . He added that the only incident was the bomb explosion at the El Salvadoran embassy and a minor incident that took place this morning in the locality of Maria pinto . Caceres said that he will remain all day at the La Moneda Palace in order to brief President Pinochet on the voting proceedings and any security problem that might arise .

All Chileans should be proud for once again participating in an exemplary election . 2 . on behalf of the Supreme government, I would like to convey a deserved recognition to the armed forces and Carabineros, who have led an electoral process in order and tranquility, and to all the people who participated today at the voting stations .

It was not just a task of simple restoration, but primarily a creative task which, in order to succeed, had to be carried out in the deep roots of national tradition . 6 . The Armed Forces and Carabineros fulfilled the commitment made in September L973 . The mission has been fulfilled . authentic democracy as a way of life and a form of government has been created, and the transition process ends on 11 March L990 . from now on it will be the responsibility of every Chilean to keep watch so that the stability and progress achieved with political will and constant effort will continue to prevail in our free society .

During all that time, the Perpetrarors fired their weapons and detonated explosives . This was proved by the finding of many Shell casings near the Jesuits' residence . The witness' statements also confirmed that the weapons were fired over a long period of time . The number of individuals who committed the crime was large . They were wearing Army uniforms . The witness saw approximately five individuals wearing Army uniforms . The witness saw the men .

Despite the evident and verifiable Militarization of the area where the crime took place, the Curfew, the extended and heavy firing inside the Uca premises, the detonation of explosives for an extended period of time during which the Perpetrators remained inside the Jesuit facilities--which gave the Perpetrators time to search the Jesuit priests' rooms, kill them along with the other two victims, and search and burn the Jesuit center church, thus proving the size of the operation--the armed forces did not react as they would have if this operation had been carried out by the Fmln . This indicates that the soldiers in charge of security in the Manuel Jose Arce military neighborhood and the armed forces joint Chiefs of staff installations were aware of the operation that was being carried out . Therefore, the Archbishopric's legal assistance office concludes that all the evidence indicates that military personnel of the Salvadoran armed forces are responsible for the murder of the six Jesuit priests and the two maids."

El Salvador suspended all types of relations with Nicaragua on 26 November, after the Salvadoran Army discovered a plane coming from Managua with weapons for the Farabundo Marti National liberation front . Cristiani has insisted that``without the material support that the Sandinist government gives the terrorists operating here, they would not have been able to launch the unsuccessful offensive of 11 November in San Salvador and other important cities around the country . The President said that in San Jose, Costa Rica, he showed Ortega a great deal of evidence of the Nicaraguan intervention in Salvadoran affairs . He also showed all the Presidents a Video in which members of the Fmln are shown receiving training in Nicaragua, and in which Fmln leaders such as Jorge Shafik Handal and others are shown receiving instructions in Managua, and other evidence . After viewing several minutes of such evidence, Ortega got up and told the Presidents he was going to make a telephone call, but he never returned to the room, Cristiani said .``in other words, Ortega was never able to deny he is sending weapons and help to the Fmln ,""the President pointed out."

The agreements signed in Costa Rica are another step Foward in the interest of peace in Central America . However, we are not completely satisfied, because, as I was telling the central American Presidents yesterday, it is one thing to agree on something and sign an agreement, but what we do when we return to our countries is quite another . There must be consistency between what is signed and what is done . If we sign an agreement and promise to respect human rights, then we must respect human rights - - not kill priests and brutally repress the people as in El Salvador . If we agree that the Contras must be Demobilized, then the Honduran government must do its part to ensure that the Contras are Demobilized . We must demand that the U.S. government respect the agreements . The problem we face is that after every Presidential summit is held and agreements are signed, the Yankee government does not respect them and continues to do as it pleases . I hope the U.S. government will, once and for all, respect the agreements signed by the central American Presidents . The United States can show its willingness to respect these agreements by refraining from hindering the dialogue between the Fmln and the Salvadoran government and the search for a negotiated solution to the Salvadoran conflict . If the U.S. government is truly willing to respect these agreements, then it must no longer give the Contras money to murder the Nicaraguan people . like the central American Presidents said, that money should be given to the International Commission of support and verification . only in this way will the Contras stop being a threat to the Nicaraguan people."

996,DEV-MUC3-0997,CARACAS ,1989-12-15,"The Colombian 19 April movement has asked Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez for political support to secure compliance with the agreements signed between the guerrillas and the government of Colombian President Virgilio Barco . Everth Bustamante, the M-19's international relations Secretary, said today in Caracas that on 14 December he informed Perez about the grave political crisis which had exploded in his country in recent days . The resignation of the Presidents of Colombia's two largest political parties, as well as the Colombian Congress' position in favor of submitting to a referendum the ruling on Extraditing drug trafficking suspects, in defiance of the government's position, has created a political vacuum in the country and, Bustamante said, the government no longer has a monopoly of power . This situation, he added, creates doubts about compliance with the agreement signed in November 1988 by the M-19 and the government . in line with this agreement, the rebels would surrender their weapons . In recent months the Venezuelan President has met on several occasions with representatives of the Colombian government and the M-19 and has proposed that the Socialist International receive the arms of this guerrilla organization which wants to join Colombia's political life . Bustamante said that the situation that has emerged has imposed a delay in the surrendering the weapons which had been scheduled for 19 December . He did not give a new date for this action, but he did not discard either the possibility that it could be in January of next year . An acute political confrontation exploded in Colombia when the Colombia Congress decided, against the government's will, to submit to a referendum the practice of Extraditing drug trafficking suspects to the United States so that they may be tried there . Bustamante noted: This makes it evident that many legislators support the demands of the drug traffickers . Bustamante admitted, however, that these Extraditions violate Colombia's Constitution . According to the M-19 leader,``the only way""of overcoming the current political crisis is to postpone the elections scheduled to take place next year and to Convoke a constituent National Assembly and a referendum to decide on constitutional reforms . These two points form part of the agreement signed in November 1988 by the M-19 and the government . Bustamante, who leaves tomorrow for Mexico city and London, called on the Colombian guerrilla groups to surrender their weapons if the government Convokes a constituent assembly."

The priests were killed on 16 November . According to Hernandez, her statement was personal and she limited herself to reporting on the investigations she conducted at Uca after the murder . in her statement, Hernandez said that she found four bullet casings inside Uca . The prosecutors then alleged that she had committed a crime by picking up evidence . I made personal statements as a witness . I told them what I saw and heard at the site of the crime . that is what I did . The prosecutors asked me about the evidence I had gathered at the site of the crime . I picked up four bullet casings . The prosecutors said I had committed a crime . that is, therefore, the crime I committed . Although she did not provide sufficient facts to formulate an opinion, Hernandez said that as an institution, the Archbishopric legal assistance office believes that the evidence, which she did not mention, indicates that armed forces members, who remain unidentified, are responsible for the murder of the Jesuits . the church already issued its official document clearly stating that there are armed forces members involved in the murder of the Jesuit priests . on what does the church base that assertion? on the investigations conducted by the Archbishopric legal assistance office . Yes, but what proof does the church have to make that assertion? all that is contained in the church document that was already released . You can get that document if you want . In addition, Maria Julia Hernandez denied statements made by some military chiefs who said that witness Lucia Cerna, who is out of the country, was never manipulated or pressured . I was introduced to Mrs Cerna by the head of the provincial Jesuit order on Monday , 20 November . in front of him, Mrs Cerna made her statement . and she made that same statement before the judge and the prosecutors at the Spanish embassy . They are witnesses to those statements . In other words, she made the statement at the Spanish Embassy before I met her . I could not have manipulated her at all .

Our fighters have carried out countless heroic and daring acts since them . Neither the concentration of the elite battalions in San Salvador nor the millions of dollars of U.S. military assistance or full range of U.S. technology and experience could prevent our forces from entering and occupying extensive urban areas and organizing strategic Harassment of the city . Our heroic fighters assaulted the country's five major vital centers--San Salvador, San Miguel, Santa Ana, Usulutan, and Zacatecoluca . beginning on the 11th, the war theatre irreversibly moved from the countryside to the main cities . to postpone imminent collapse and to stop a people's uprising, the fatally wounded military leadership and the Fascist government ordered that the low-income neighborhoods be bombarded . They did not care how many civilian lives it would cost . with all of its elite and regular battalions, the enemy Army was reduced to the defensive and to guarding the cities . extensive areas around the rest of the country are liberated territory . The war is now where it can be defined--in the vital centers . There is no way the Oligarchs' exclusive economic program can take off and the Fascist government of arena, with its Genocidal brutality unmasked, is internationally isolated and hated by the people for its crimes . This great effort of audacity and heroism that began on 11 November has placed the military leadership and the Cristiani administration in their most critical position of the 9 years of war . Thus far, during this extraordinary effort--which has given to El Salvador and the world real hope for democracy and peace for our country--401 of the most generous and brave sons of our homeland have fallen in combat . This list is headed by our dear and unforgettable comrade commander Dimas Rodriguez, to whom we owe decisive contributions in the conduct of our struggle toward victory . The following military commanders who fell in combat also made a contribution: Jorge Orlando Sandoval Cervellon, commander Oscar; Jehova Vasquez, commander Cirilo; Ovidio Lopez, commander Orlando Morales; commander Misael Gallardo; commander Nicolas Alberto Saravia, Wilbert; commander Ricardo Miranda, Esteban Ruiz; and the commander Odir political directors--Jose Santos Yanez, Pepe; and Milagro Alvarado, Judy .

The realization of a genuine and definitive change is ensured by the great power of our revolutionary Army, of all of our people, and of world solidarity . those who fell taught to us the courage and determination to finish this extraordinary effort, to conquer what we think the people justly deserve--democracy, progress, and peace . eternal glory to the heroes and Martyrs, builders of democracy and peace .

We want to stress that all our offensives have centered around the main cities in our country . one of the most important and significant achievements of this struggle by the people and the Fmln is having maintained the Besiegement on the most important political and economic points, most especially on the country's capital . There has been great pressure in the case of San Salvador, and the Fmln has forced the joint Chiefs of staff, Colonel Ponce, and the Fascist high command to change their strategic tactics three times . You will recall that the joint Chiefs of staff first tried to dislodge the Fmln forces that had entered since the evening of 11 November . When the first puppet Army strategic defense tactic failed, they then tried to isolate the Fmln forces from one another and annihilate them one by one . for this, they concentrated special forces, especially using elite battalions, in a siege modality for annihilation . This also failed . faced with the second failure of their special tactics to end the offensive in a few days, as Cristiani and the high military command had said, they moved a great number of operational forces from the country's interior, such as the elite battalions, to set up an extensive siege to defend the capital city and prevent our forces from entering it . As all our people have been able to see--and international public opinion has also been able to verify this through a great amount of information flowing through international reporters--that siege to keep out the Fmln has also failed . This means more victories and successes, such as Incursions into the Escalon neighborhood and the Southern area of Antiguo Cuscatlan, and two important attacks on the joint Chiefs of staff . right now we see that the puppet Army's special city operation is their third and last plan . They have formed four commands to control the city, which will also be defeated by our Fmln military forces . We also must add to this list of achievements that the great concentration of enemy Army operational forces in the capital has caused a great national imbalance in forces . This means that extensive areas of the country are without the protection of the puppet troops . We have taken advantage of this and have worked on organizing the people and raising a people's power, an alternative to local reactionary power . We also record as a successful offensive during this first month the fact that our enemy's intelligence work has been completely smashed . The searches, which have been entrusted in an improvised manner to military troops concentrated in the cities, especially the repressive Corps, have attempted to restore all the intelligence data banks to be able to try and destroy the people's struggle . We must also record as one of the successes of our general offensive during this first month the fact that the puppet Army was forced to abort another plan . Even though there were some bloody events, such as the murder of the Jesuit priests, along with a great amount of kidnappings and missing people and arrests of members or leaders of Grassroot people's movements, we feel that the Army and repressive Corps are incapable of attending to the Fmln offensive and the Besiegement at the same time that they are trying to carry out their annihilation of the people's movement . So this is another success."

I think the situation in the country demands military stability . changes could provoke some unrest . We think no significant changes in the military command should be made at present because of the current situation . should any changes be made, it would be for major reasons in the service . No high-level changes have been anticipated, however . referring to the rebels' activities, Col Ponce said the armed actions initiated, particularly in San Salvador on 11 November, have ended with unfavorable results for the guerrillas . He advised, however, that the guerrillas will continue to sabotage the country's economy and Perpetrate terrorist actions . I can tell you that the Fmln has failed, militarily speaking . The Fmln's famous all - the - way offensive has ended in tremendous failure, determined by the Salvadoran people . We can anticipate that the Fmln will continue its sabotaging actions and terrorism which could destroy stores in San Salvador, as well as posts and Pylons on highways . The Salvadoran people can rest assured, however, that an offensive action by the Fmln at present can be disregarded . regarding the Christmas and new year festivities, which have been marred by the wave of violence, many people have wondered whether the 2300 - to - 0500 Curfew is still in force . Ponce said the possibility of lifting the Curfew at least on 24 and 31 December is being considered so that the Salvadoran families can enjoy these festivities . He added that such a measure, however, will depend on the Fmln's stance .

They have established``local people's governments""in 8 of the 14 provinces throughout the country . During this period, the government dispatched armored cars and Air Force units to carry out Counterattacks .

During their talks the guerrillas demanded that the government stop its suppression, introduce political, economic, and judicial reforms, reorganize the armed forces, and punish the``Dare-To-Die squad .""the government insisted that the guerrillas should lay down their arms before reforms were carried out . The hard-line position of the government reflected the established policy of the ruling party, which has all along stood for ruling the country by military means, advocated the suppression of democratic forces, and supported the``Dare-To-Die squad""in carrying out assassination . A University president in Central America was assassinated by the squad for criticizing the Ultrarightist policy of the ruling party . recently the ruling party supported the``Dare-To-Die squad""in attacking the labor Federation's building .

It would be worse if you didn't do it . It would be less effective, though it would be somewhat effective . don't be unjust . It would be even less effective if we all remained silent and said: yes, Uncle Sam, you are the master and we must obey . We are the Uncle Tom in Latin America . look, I don't expect .... we don't have to mix them . We continue our negotiation with the IMF, and that to me still seems very positive . May it not turn out as the illusion I had that relations were changing at the Poltical level . First, I would not allow a hardening of Peru attitude toward the United States . There is a hardening when one slaps someone else in the face . In this case we have a concrete subject of discussion . There is a great issue to discuss between Latin America and the United States . You don't have the right to invade . who called you? Endara himself had to say--because he knows what the Panamanian people thinking, though a percentage of them are indifferent--that he did not call them . do you know what that means? President Endara says that he didn't call for the invasion . This should be automatically understood . for some reason he said it . So I would not call it a hardening . I beg you to understand the exact shade of the term . We are Energic in opposing a concrete fact, but what do the people of New Hampshire, the people of California, the people of Georgia, the people of Jefferson, of Whitman, of Linclon--that great defender of human rights and racial equality--what have they have to do with that act? we have to respect the greatness of the United States . from Latin America, the United States is seen in various ways . for the time being, I see it as the Rome of the modern world . I have always thought that the Latin Americans must be understood inside the United States . The Latin American experience has to seen inside the United States . Then a sound Relationshinp will emerge between the two continents . because the United States is the Rome of the modern world--for the capacity of its atomic legions; for their having concentrated science and philosophy, although both were brought over from Europe as the Romans brought them from Greece; for their having generated an extraordinary technology, and for their being a democracy--the United States must be respected . We will have to distinguish all that from a particular act by the U.S. administration . This is why we say Americans referring to the people of the United States, and say Yankee to define some acts by the U.S. administration . So I don't believe, sir, that there is a hardening, and I also believe that they understand it very well . I believe they understand me when I tell them that I cannot sit at the table with them when they are killing Panamanian people . Let the ministers, the police Chiefs, the prosecutors, the Attorney generals sit at a table . that is good . But the representative of the nation? do you understand what I mean? I think this is a good opportunity to explain it . I do not believe it would be a bad thing for Mr Mantilla to sit with Mr Bennett or with the justice Minister of Colombia . I do not believe this would be bad . This is the proof that we want to continue the antidrug plan . But those who Personify the nation cannot meet . We cannot do so under the present circumstances . So this is not hardening . As for the IMF, I believe that it is an absolutely different matter . These matters are well differentiated . I am not here as a Demagogue, as some right wing media assert . those people are Fightened when I draw a lot of people despite my Poltical decline . I am not being a Demagogue, and I am not here because the best way to win votes is to indulge in anti-American politics from here until 28 July 1990 . I will not lapse into that irresponsibility . Here we have a concrete fact that has nothing to do with our cultural, commercial, political, and economic relations with organizations where the United States may or may not have influence . I separate things very well."

The declaration also received the support of intransigent party deputy Oscar Alende, Christian Democratic party deputy Hector Gatti, and popular Democratic party deputy Alberto Aramouni .

He said that they not were Marxist guerrilla Sympathizers . The NOTE reads as follows : 23 December 1989 prov . 264/89 director Dutriz director of La Prensa Grafica San Salvador dear Mr.Director: the newspaper which you direct, on 21 December 1989, published on pages 6 and 7 two articles on the six Jesuit priests that were murdered on 16 November . These articles are written in such a way that they distort the reality of the case or they incorrectly describe the activity of the society of Jesus . on page 6 an article entitled``Fratricidal struggle ,""which is signed by Mr. Luis Pazos, says that``the priests were Marxist guerrilla Sympathizers""and that the University in which they work``is known in El Salvador as an intellectual center for guerrillas .""the article speaks of``these priests' Neomarxist-Philosophical position which is contrary to Christian doctrine .""I wish to state that : 1 . The murdered priests were not Sympathizers of the Marxist guerrillas . They only tried to talk with the different sectors in conflict in El Salvador, seeking to Mediate in an effort to find peace with justice . 2 . Perhaps some people in El Salvador consider the Uca as an intellectual center for guerrillas, but there are also many people who think that the Uca courageously follows the Church's social doctrine . This statement, if made without the reservation that it only represents the views of a group of people and the fact that the article Forgets to mention the many others do not believe, is in our opinion a manipulation of the truth . 3 . The position of the priests was not``Neomarxist""in the philosophical field . father Ellacuria came from the school of the Spanish philosopher Zubiri, whose thoughts were deeply rooted in Christian philosophy . father Amando Lopez wrote his Doctoral thesis on the Spanish philosopher and priest Amor Ruibal . The``Zubirian""inclination of father Ellacuria was internationally known in most philosophical schools . those who accuse the murdered priests of having Neomarxist philosophical positions are publicly acknowledging their ignorance . 4 . statements such as these, which were repeated in other media before the murder of the priests, partly promoted their murder . We therefore consider their repetition to be a very serious matter . on page 7, and in an editorial article, the newspaper mentions the need to avoid``the damage caused by private Pseudo-Investigations, wherever they might come from .""on this statement I want to simply add that in a case like this the injured party has every right, both in El Salvador and in any other part of the world, to conduct its own private investigation . Furthermore, unless publicly and Irrefutably proven harmful, no one has the right to condemn it``in advance""saying that it is playing detectives . I beg of you Mr. director, based on the right to reply and the justice that the murdered Jesuits and those who believe in them deserve, that you publish this Clarifications in your newspaper with the same desire to reach your readers as those who wrote the articles . yours truly . father Jose Maria Tojeira society of Jesus provincial .

Our greatest wish is for each individual in the nation, without exception, to enjoy Well- being and peace at home . We can affirm that during our tenure we have constantly striven toward the higher goals of collective progress and well-being in the specific situations we have faced during these 4 years of government--situations that are natural to a developing country like ours . On 25 January 1990 we will present to Congress a report summing up the achievements made during our administration . Thus, all the people will be truthfully informed of our accomplishments and of the projects that have been undertaken so that the Honduran people can develop material and social conditions in accordance with the historical evolution to which we aspire, both as individuals and as a state . We have expressed our desire for peace at six Central American Summits, where we defended the democratic processes and condemned any form of totalitarianism as well as the terrorist actions that have caused many deaths and brought sorrow to the central American people . I am proud to say that the Tela summit has contributed to the search for peace and democracy in Central America, especially in those countries plagued by violence . We have always maintained that great sacrifices are necessary if we are to make social progress, and we have constantly worked to establish the necessary conditions for the country's development . Our achievements are lasting and have given the country better prospects for the future . that has been our main objective . We did not resort to Demagoguery, and we spoke the truth--during the electoral campaign and later as the leader of the nation's destiny--so as not to create false expectations among the people . I want to reassert that once I step down from the Presidency, I will continue from the private sector to strive for the unity of the Honduran people so that with effort and work we may improve our living standards . Finally I want to express my sincere desire for success--for the well-being of the Fatherland--to Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero, who will take office as President on 27 January L990 .

Bishop Pablo Smith and Francisca Colomer Misquita were seriously wounded . This is part of the escalation of violence by the U.S. government, which invaded Panama and conducted a military incursion into the home of the Nicaraguan ambassador in that country . The Nicaraguan government condemns these serious incidents, which endanger the peace efforts conducted by the central American Presidents and supported by the Nicaraguan people . Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega Saavedra calls on the international community and on the country's political and social forces to condemn this brutal crime perpetrated against religious people . This action is similar to the assassination of the six Jesuit priests perpetrated in San Salvador on 16 November 1989 by the Salvadoran Army, which just as the Counterrevolution and the other rightist Nicaraguan forces, defends the aggressive policies of the United States .

1035,DEV-MUC3-1036,HAVANA ,1990-01-04,"The blow dealt to the Latin American conscience by the U.S . intervention in Panama is about to Deflate the optimistic hopes for a joint struggle against the drug trade . Even George Bush's 15 February meeting in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, with the Presidents of Bolivia, Peru, and Colombia--the leading producers of Coca leaves--is in jeopardy . Peruvian chief executive Alan Garcia made it known that he will not attend the meeting in protest of the Panama invasion . Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora is being questioned by the Bolivian Supreme Court over the Extradition to the United States of former Colonel Luis Arce Gomez . The court regards Paz Zamora's decision on this matter as undue exercise of jurisdictional powers and an attack on the judicial branch . Bolivian chief justice Edgar Oblitas charged that the Extradition of Arce Gomez, who was a notorious drug Trafficker, an executioner and a Plotter, has prevented the authorities from clearing up several recent events in Bolivian history, which thus remain just partially known . for its part, Colombia reacted with surprise and indignation to reports that the United States plans to establish Airspace and naval patrols within Colombian jurisdiction without consulting with Bogota . The White House in Washington stated later that the patrols will take place over international waters and that they will entail concerted actions . It is known, however, that an eventual blockade of the Colombian Coast is part of a package of special measures coordinated by U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney . The Colombian police, who have been credited with Seizing 80 percent of the total annual amount of cocaine seized worldwide, have in recent weeks dealt severe blows to the Medellin cartel drug Lords . The punitive U.S. action would in practice entail that the United States does not recognize these achievements and would create an embarrassing situation for President Virgilio Barco in a year when COLOMBIANS will elect a new President, members of Congress, Mayors, departmental deputies, and Councilmen . The claim that the action is intended to more effectively prevent the drug trade is highly suspicious, taking into account that it will not be matched by equivalent stiff measures in the country holding the world record in drug consumption and that U.S . troops are currently occupying Colombia's neighboring country, Panama . Where does the U.S . desire to Chase criminals end and where does its imperialist desire to limit Latin American sovereignty and to decide the fate of our peoples start? the Panamanian case is an example . It is not not only legitimate but necessary for us to be Distrustful."

1037,DEV-MUC3-1038,CLANDESTINE,,"The violent and surprising events in Venezuela and Argentina earlier in the year, which resulted in thousands killed, are an indication of what will happen in coming years . with its Interventionist policy, the United States has negated our peoples' self - determination and embittered the relations between the countries in the area . by preventing the social forces from acting freely, the United States prolongs the war and eliminates the possibility of achieving true democratization . The U.S. imperialist policy has weakened in the decade ending today . Latin Americanism has advanced and the time of a docile and puppet continent has been left behind . Latin American interests and social forces have matured . Despite 30 years of invasion and commercial freezing, Cuba is still Unbeaten . Nicaragua has resisted, has defeated 10 years of war waged by mercenaries, and is preparing to Legitimize its revolution . In El Salvador, the 10 years of Counterinsurgency with which the United States has tried to defeat us and which the United States has tried to impose on us have failed . The insurgency problems that were previously resolved with a few advisers and in a couple of years remain unsettled in El Salvador despite a $3 billion aid package, nearly 1,000 advisers, and 10 years of bloody war . in the past the problem of Panama would have been settled with a coup in a few hours' time, but now 2 years of economic freezing, subversion, businessmen's strikes, attacks, and thwarted coups were necessary . Finally, the United States had to use 30,000 men, destroy a country, and fight for 1 week to bring to submission an Army and a military head they themselves had trained . Latin Americanism is on its way forward . The decade now beginning belongs to Latin America . The struggle in our continent is of an Anti-Imperialist nature . Our struggle, as everyone knows, started in Central America 10 years ago with the triumph of the Sandinist revolution and the beginning of war in our country . This has turned the region into a true Vietnam during this decade . because of all this, the sacrifice that our struggle entails is great and the process is complex, because both the struggle and the process occur in a changing world situation . While in Eastern Europe the areas of influence are disappearing and the peoples' self - determination is opening to an unhindered path, the U.S . empire walks in the opposite direction and clings to its Neocolonial domination of Latin America and the Caribbean . What is at stake in El Salvador is not precisely communism or capitalism, but democracy and the continent's independence . Latin America aspires, not to a restricted society, but to a self-sufficient development and internal social balance with the participation of many social sectors . The central American societies appear to be polarized in the eyes of both employers and workers, but the need for independence will coalesce all of these forces . In this context, our struggle, which is essentially for self - determination and democracy, is in the capitalist world the spearhead of the struggle of all Latin American and third world countries, which demand these transformations . all that our people have done these years and all that has been constructed by our combatants, military commanders, political leaders, and those who have worked either as diplomats or guerrillas has now become very significant . The changes in strategy, the Reshuffling of plans, the heroic resistance of the masses, the unity of the revolutionary movement, the political - ideological flexibility, the definition of a political platform adapted to the demand of the struggle, the large number of both local and international relations that have been established, and all that has been constructed with the blood of the best children of the people constitute our full contribution to the construction of democracy and sovereignty in El Salvador and Latin America and help make the people's victory more likely than ever."

Spanish, British, French, and Canadian police agents have participated in these investigations . These Salvadoran soldiers had searched the Jesuits' residence 2 days before the killing, Ponce told the media today without giving much detail .

Every source consulted with by Acan-Efe, whether diplomatic or religious, agreed to say that now it is important for Cristiani to take one step further and mention the names of the people involved in this murder carried out at Uca . Two domestic servants were killed together with the clergymen, five Spaniards, including Uca Rector Ignacio Ellacuria, and a Salvadoran . The U.S. Embassy in El Salvador also congratulated Cristiani today for his efforts to clarify the assassination, as U.S . Congressmen and officials of the Bush administration had asked of him . In fact, diplomatic sources commented to Acan-Efe that beginning on 22 January, the U.S. Congress is to discuss a new $90 million package of economic and military aid to El Salvador that might hinge on the status of the investigations . The United States has given over $3 billion in military and economic aid to El Salvador over the past decade, and at present it is giving about $1.4 million daily, according to Salvadoran political sources . Uca Rector Francisco Estrada said that Cristiani could take this step because``He is confident that he can control any internal resentment within his government and the armed forces .""a similar opinion was expressed by a European diplomat, who told Acan-Efe that Cristiani is taking a great risk by accusing members of the armed forces of this crime . He added:``If he has done this, it is because he feels very self-confident .""observers compare the investigation being carried out by the present rightist government with one carried out by the government of Jose Napoleon Duarte, a Christian Democrat, into the 1980 murder of Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero . Duarte, who turned over power to Cristiani on 1 June 1989, on several occasions attributed the murder of Archbishop Romero to Roberto D' Aubuisson, a present deputy and leader of the ruling nationalist Republican alliance, but the investigations never led to any concrete results."

But, speaking to Rne, Ruben Zamora expressed his reservations about the real identity and responsibility of the Perpetrators of the massacre . President Cristiani has still not given any names and so we can't say anything because it's all based on rumors . Therefore, the first thing to be seen is who is involved and, Secondly, whether they are really brought to trial and, thirdly, whether they really are sentenced for the crime which they have committed . So, there are still many obstacles in the way before giving a final opinion on the matter . Ruben Zamora had a 45-Minute meeting with Spanish foreign minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez at the foreign Ministry . He expressed the need for and urgency of a political solution in El Salvador, of aiding--through the mediation of the UN Secretary General--negotiations between the government and the Farabundo Marti National liberation front guerrillas .

This is the commitment of the government of the Republic and the armed forces . However, it is wise to clarify that, in the same manner that people have made demands and condemned the case at issue today, actions resulting from the wave of Fmln terrorist violence should also be condemned and punished with the same vehemence . in the same manner, again we want to urge all Salvadorans to abstain from speculating over these regrettable incidents, because that will only hinder the judicial process . It is necessary that law and justice prevail in our country, so that no one Tramples on them . in regard to this investigation, we wish to reaffirm that an objectivity has prevailed at all times, and that the accused will be sent to the pertinent court so that they stand trial according to the mechanisms established in the Constitution and in other laws . In conclusion, we want to tell the Salvadoran people that, although it is true this is a regrettable incident, we must accept it as an unavoidable reality and as evidence to the world that we Salvadorans and our institutions have a high sense of justice, morality, and ethics . As commander of the armed forces, I want to congratulate all its members for their professionalism, dedication, and exemplary conduct, evidenced not only in view of this incident, but also by halting--in defense of democracy and peace--the Fmln terrorist aggression . that brilliant historic event will always be present in the hearts of our people, who will render homage to the armed forces for having protected the freedom of our future generations .

In other words, since the Latin American Republics were formed, we have never had almost 90 percent of the continent living within Democratic systems as we do now . We have never had the perspectives we had today . I am optimistic about the future of my country, of Latin America, and especially of our three countries . I am so optimistic that I even want to point out something that touches our souls . We will begin the decade by winning the world soccer championship in Italy . We must not underestimate soccer, because soccer is culture, too, and represents our peoples' strength . taking into account that mine is an optimistic point of view, I would like to tell you that over the next 10 years, Latin America will face a number of problems . one of those problems will be to find a way to rejoin an economic, financial, and commercial world from which Latin America was gradually expelled during the last decade and even during the 1970's."

If the extra profits resulting from diluting the powder by mixing it with other substances is added to this amount, their gross earnings may amount to $100 billion per year . The DEA's estimate of $140 billion is reached by adding to the $100 billion that the Colombian cocaine finally generates about $40 billion generated by Peruvian and Colombian narcotics traffickers . Caballero asserts that Colombian drug traffickers invest approximately $1 billion of the net earnings of $4.060 billion in Colombia . According to the Colombian Federation of real estate markets and UN consultants, this money has been invested in 1 million hectares of farmland and ranges, buildings, industries, and tourism businesses . The $1 billion the Colombian drug traffickers have invested annually in Colombia during the 1980's represents 2.8 percent of the country's $35 billion GNP . According to the DEA, the 270 tons of cocaine that arrive in the United States from Colombia represent 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in that country . DEA sources have reported that the CALI cartel, the other Colombian mafia organization and second largest after the Medellin cartel, controls the wholesale market in New York and part of that in Los Angeles and San Francisco . The struggle for those markets resulted last year in what the police dubbed the``war among the cartels ,""and in the killing of 100 members from both organizations . According to Statistics from the Colombian national University , 3,000 persons die from drug abuse in the United States every year, while alcohol and tobacco cause 520,000 deaths per year there."

The dynamite attack was perpetrated, according to Colombian authorities, by the Army of national liberation, which is considered the most radical rebel group of the many operating in the country . According to reports, members of that insurgent organization completely blew up a stretch of the Cano Limon-Covenas oil pipeline, in an area close to Teorama in Norte de Santander Department . Since last year the ELN, which is headed by several former Spanish priests, has perpetrated over 30 attacks against Colombian oil installations to protest the joint exploitation of crude by the government and multinational companies."
1068,DEV-MUC3-1069,TEGUCIGALPA,,"Milton Mateo of Hrn, commander Borge . In response to a question from my colleague from El Salvador, you said that you hoped for an agreement between the Salvadoran rebels and the Salvadoran Army and government . you, like all central Americans, want peace, but do you not think that this runs contrary to the fact that the Salvadoran government has presented reliable proof of military aid to the leftist Salvadoran guerrillas, and recently, an armed forces public relations officer said that Nicaragua is a sanctuary for a subversive group known as the Cinchoneros of Honduras? as for the statement that Nicaragua is a sanctuary for a Honduran guerrilla group, I wish to say that the statement is not only false, but a serious charge . I invite anyone who wants to come to Nicaragua, including the Honduran authorities, to do so . We will give them absolute freedom to show where the Cinchoneros camps are located, where their headquarters are located or their activities are being carried out . If this exists, it cannot be hidden . It is very difficult to hide a military training camp . I assure the Honduran government and people very seriously and with a high sense of responsibility, that Nicaragua will not provide any opportunity for guerrilla groups from other countries to establish camps in Nicaragua, especially when it concerns Honduras . What about the Salvadoran guerrillas? many things have been said about El Salvador . It is said that we supply weapons to the Salvadoran Revolutionaries . This charge has been made for many years . I could say that the airplane that we downed in Nicaragua, flown by the famous Hasenfus, came from El Salvador, but why bring that up? the fact is that there exists in the world a powerful intelligence agency, known as the CIA, which has enormous technical and human resources that can enable it to accurately determine what is happening anywhere, and yet it has never been able to demonstrate that Nicaragua is providing weapons to any armed movement anywhere . Therefore, let us put that into the same context as the statement that our relations with Cuba are cooling . We could also point out other lies told about us . We have been accused of all kinds of things . We have been called drug traffickers . We are accused of burning down a Jewish synagogue in Nicaragua . Incidentally, let me tell you that there has never been a Jewish synagogue in Nicaragua, yet this was said by no less than U.S. President Reagan . Thus, they tell all those lies about Nicaragua and that is one of the things that they say, just as they say that we are the enemies of human rights, that we Persecute clergymen . Note that in Nicaragua no priest has ever been imprisoned, murdered, or exiled, except on one occasion because of very special circumstances . In Nicaragua, we have made conscientious efforts to respect human rights, but the main accusation leveled against our country is failure to respect human rights . We are accused of planning electoral fraud . There was a poll done by a U.S. firm that gives the Sandinist National liberation front...I wish to point out that it is not a Sandinist company; it might have very little sympathy for Sandinism, but it is apparently a reliable company . It gives the Fsln a majority of 51 percent, and the National opposition Union--one of the political forces participating in the electoral contest--24 percent . Other polls that have been taken have given the Fsln close to 69 percent, as opposed to Uno, to which they attributed 27 percent . Yet, what is being said? that there will be electoral fraud . Therefore, that charge and others that have been made, like this one which greatly bothers me, to the effect that we are harboring subversive groups for them to come to Honduras...I can guarantee to the Honduran armed forces and to the new Honduran government that in Nicaragua we will not take a single step in that direction . On Panama, I do not need to say anything . The facts speak for themselves."

The vice president said that the Salvadoran guerrillas have lost ground in every way and the dialogue must be resumed as the only way to achieve a firm and lasting peace in the country .``the government of the Republic has never been naive regarding the Fmln's lack of sincerity during the dialogue, but it is our duty to seek peace through reason, even though we are aware of the Fmln's warlike attitude ,""Merino said . regarding the Fmln's desire to participate in the meeting to be held by the President of the Republic with the Secretary General of the United Nations in New York, Merino said the guerrillas cannot hope to be on an equal footing with the President of El Salvador .``the President is going to New York to express, once again, the sincerity with which the government seeks to achieve peace through dialogue . The Fmln's hope of having a Tete-A-Tete with the president at the United Nations is totally absurd ,""the Vice President said . Merino said that the guerrilla's only way out is to give up the armed struggle and join in the country's Democratic life, although he conceded that the process will be difficult and that it will naturally have to be gradual in order for the guerrilla fighters to feel safe``without having a weapon at the ready .""on the other hand, in reference to the case of the Jesuits, in which members of the armed forces have been implicated, Merino advised caution regarding statements that various groups in the country might make .``prudence is necessary in order to get to the truth ,""Merino said .

The government's strongman has said it is over, period . D'Aubuisson insists that there are no other military men involved in the Jesuit case, according to a headline in today's La Prensa Grafica, in which it publishes D'Aubuisson's statements . We do not believe the Prosecutor's office will summon D'Aubuisson to present the evidence that has led him to assert categorically that no other senior officers were involved in the assassination of the priests . We do not believe so, because that Prosecutor's office has not been established to summon or to inquire, not even to summon the main suspect in the murders, which have been blamed on the death squads . one of them is former President Jose Napoleon Duarte, who accused him of being the mastermind of Msgr Romero's assassination . Yet, D'Aubuisson goes on completely unscathed . Therefore, Roberto D'Aubuisson today placed a final period on the investigation of Colonel Benavides . Obviously, major D'Aubuisson, the arena strongman, is placing a final period on the case, and he is telling this directly and publicly to Cristiani, the Yankees, and the rest of La Tandona . It is imperative for arena members to tell Cristiani how far to go with the investigation . They never approved of having even the lieutenants of the Atlacatl Battalion investigated . The heated arguments within the arena leadership have Destabilized the government to such an extent that Merino's sudden fall is but the tip of the iceberg and D'Aubuisson's signal to stop a show of force . D'Aubuisson believes that serving up Benavides' head is more than enough, and this is the Frank message that arena and the government are sending to the U.S. Congress, precisely at the time the Yankee policy on El Salvador is under serious scrutiny . The strongman is telling La Tandona: do not worry any more . We had to give something to the Congress, but Cristiani's moderation will go just so far . D'Aubuisson continues to be the strongman."
1071,DEV-MUC3-1072,SAN SALVADOR,1990-01-29,"Today , 2 days before his meeting with UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, president Alfredo Cristiani reaffirmed his willingness to hold talks with the Farabundo Marti National liberation front . However, Cristiani said, the Flmn is sending contradictory signals on its commitment to peace . a few hours before departing on his trip to Washington today, the President of the Republic reiterated his willingness to resume a dialogue with the Fmln, which, he said, is one of the reasons for his visit to the UN Secretary General . The main goal is to hold a work session with the UN Secretary General . This will be on 31 January . The goal is to search for and come up with any mechanisms that could ease the resumption of the dialogue process, so all violent actions cease and so we can search for an agreement for the reincorporation of the Fmln through political means . Then we will hold a meeting with President Bush on 1 February in Washington . We will also visit other government officials . The Salvadoran President, who just returned from Honduras where he met U.S. vice president Dan Quayle and other Latin American Presidents, told newsmen today that he has received offers from the Venezuelan President to continue the dialogue in Venezuela . We are determined to search for a solution to the conflict through dialogue . This is basically what we will discuss with UN Secretary General Perez de Cuellar--searching for elements that would make this possible . regarding the Fmln, we see some contradictory indications at this time . In some communiques, the Fmln is somehow expressing the desire to return to the dialogue process, but, on the other hand, there are reports that the Fmln continues trying to plan some attacks on San Salvador, in addition to other terrorist actions aimed at the economic infrastructure . We believe this is contradictory . However, I myself believe there are some positive elements that will permit resuming a dialogue process that could bring some benefits . Asked about reports by the San Salvador auxiliary Bishop regarding searches at some Catholic Church offices, Cristiani said this should not be something to worry about, because this has been for security reasons . As part of the things taking place in the country at this time, it is possible that some reports have been totally wrong . However, I do not believe this should be taken at all as a sign of something to worry about . These actions have been for security reasons, based on reports we have received . Therefore, we must take action, and if there is nothing .... those who have no problem and have not been involved in illegal matters should have nothing to fear . The Salvadoran President said he is pleased with the statements by new Honduran President Rafael Callejas, who expressed his total support for the central American peace plan . concerning an upcoming Central American summit, the President said that no date has been set yet and he believes this cannot be done before the Nicaraguan elections."
1072,DEV-MUC3-1073,SAN SALVADOR,1990-01-29,"Colonel Mauricio Ernesto Vargas today has said there is no need or reason for the United States to suspend aid to the country . However, should we get to that point, the armed forces are ready to continue defending the democratic process . Col Vargas believes the U.S. aid is not only a matter of military assistance provided to the Salvadoran Army, but also a matter of defending the democratic process in the country . The military officer said it is not possible that a minority, as he termed the Fmln will affect, with its Disinformation methods aimed at countries abroad, U.S. military aid being cut off or decreased . However, in any case, Col Vargas said that if the aid is suspended, this would complicate the armed forces plans concerning the Counterinsurgency struggle . I certainly do not believe that we, having a democratic society, have so little capacity to defend the truth . It can take 100 days to spread a lie, but you can tell the truth in 1 day . I do not believe that in this context .... I believe we are Overestimating the Left-Wing actions . We view them as being smart, and we see ourselves as fools . any cut or suspension in the aid will cause problems because it will create further needs whenever we need to fulfill a mission . Therefore, missions will be a bit more complicated, but we will fulfill them . If Marxists--through their concept of Disinformation--believe they can attempt to harm the United States-El Salvador alliance through this process, and that this will lead them to power, they are completely wrong . They will find an armed forces which will always be firmly determined to defend the democratic process . Col Vargas, in charge of the 3D military zone in San Miguel, said he agrees with the decision to prosecute the eight military men, including one Colonel and two lieutenants, charged with killing six Jesuit priests . Col Vargas said those who have broken the law must pay for it, no matter who they are . The Army will feel pain in the event any of its members are involved in actions which violate the principles that rule the armed forces . This is very painful . However, if we are building a democracy, there are facts that must be judged according to the norms prevailing in a democracy . democracy must prevail over people . democracy is more important than individuals and than institutions in individual terms, and more important than the individual interest of people or groups, which cannot prevail over the national interest . in the military aspect, Col Vargas said that as of 1990, in his area of responsibility, they are implementing the plans drafted by the joint Chiefs of staff known as``victory and hammer""which has offered, as preliminary results , 53 clashes , 37 guerrillas and 12 soldiers killed, and weapons seizures . The two operations, he added, have been successful."
1073,DEV-MUC3-1074,SAN SALVADOR,1990-01-25,"On Tuesday afternoon the police in Washington arrested the leaders of a group of demonstrators who had gathered in front of the Capitol to demand the suspension of military aid to El Salvador . a few hours later, representatives of several churches asserted that a persecution had been launched in our country against``religious people""and that the aid should be suspended for that reason . The foregone conclusion was that, because of the suspension of the aid, our government would have no other option but to negotiate with the terrorists . This campaign dates back a long time . It began with the arrival in El Salvador of several Jesuit priests from Lovaina University in the early 1960's and continued with the founding of Uca, the active participation of certain priests in the subversive movements, the agitation launched by the alas priests, the tragic episode involving Msgr Oscar Arnulfo Romero, and the use of that episode by the left . El Salvador was, and to some extent continues to be, the scenario in which the``theology of liberation""reached its ultimate consequences by placing the Inquisitorial fanaticism of certain priests and pastors side by side with the most radical currents of socialism . The virulence of the onslaught went that far partly because of the passive attitude--or, rather, the Conniving Permissiveness--of the Christian Democratic regime, which tried to take advantage of the strident campaign to further its own political ends . Duarte never truly distanced himself far from the guerrillas because of his Ill-Disguised ideological Leanings, which led him to coincide in great part with the subversives' tenets and above all with the fanciful idea that the people approved of the establishment of a Communist state in El Salvador . It is certainly difficult to counter organized Slander, taking into consideration how far certain notions have gone and how much support they receive from the news media in a large part of the world . The possibilities of successfully countering this propaganda offensive may not be the best, but it would be worse to remain silent and do nothing . We have yet to see the organization of a true effort to reject the permanent defamation being withstood by the country . There is no answer to the accusations and insults issued by certain sectors, either . to allow a person who acts as leader of the terrorists' political front to come to the country and scold President Cristiani without having the authorities arrest him for his participation in crimes perpetrated against the Republic is to fall into dangerous extremes of tolerance . was not Jennifer Casolo allowed to openly represent the subversives for many years without investigating her more closely? is it perhaps that the laws allow a foreigner to meddle in the country's internal affairs? How can judges be banned from certain installations, such as the the bombed Fenastras headquarters, universities, and similar places, when there are sufficient grounds to suspect that terrorists are hidden in such places?"

What do you think about kidnappings? we are living in a time where all have to become up to date, but being up to date does not mean we have to become darker . quite the contrary, it means shedding more light on life . We are bent on this . of course, this also means that we have to abandon practices like kidnapping . surely you know very well who your nemesis was 24 hours ago . What would you suggest regarding military training and orientation in Colombia? armed forces have been organized for centuries to win wars . In Colombia we have to organize the military to achieve peace, particularly peace at home . The military has a great contribution to make and there are valuable individuals within it . The Democratic lineage does not exhaust itself in guerrillas, and there is also a great democratic quality in the armed forces . What do you feel after killing so many policemen? we will have to ask the police what they think after killing so many guerrillas . We have lived in violence in this country . questions dealing with violence and war should be avoided . What did you feel when you passed in front of the Palace of Justice yesterday? I did not do that . I am still looking forward to walking past the Palace of justice . What do you think you will feel after what happened in the Palace? well, that this is something to ponder . According to what the people have expressed to me, some Colombian sectors find it difficult to believe that you people, who stormed the Palace of justice, are the same ones who are among the most protected in this country . I have always wondered how Colombia dealt with the fact that Santander was the first man pardoned in Colombia . What does that mean? that means that if Santander, a lawmaker, was pardoned after his attempt on bolivar's life, and we are living in a nation built largely on what Santander did, the life of men is made of light and shades . and they have to live as they are."

We are yet not completely sure that the invading country, the United States, is totally willing to or intends to withdraw its soldiers from a small Latin American country .

This is a problem of better prices for cocoa, coffee, and Annatto seeds . This is a problem with the processing factories in the higher Huallaga Valley area and Airlines that transport these products to the United States . This concept has been accepted after 4 and 1/2 years; when it was finally about to be put down in the document in Santa Cruz, one of the countries modified it, thus hindering further progress in the negotiations . This subject is now being reviewed, and the summit could be postponed for a few days until we reach full agreement on such an important summit, which was proposed by the Peruvian Presidency . We must gather at the Cartagena summit with a concrete proposal . It cannot be simply a social gathering . We are not teenagers who are attending the meeting simply because the President of the most important country in the world will be there . We cannot go there as desperate and dazzled youngsters to hold his hand . We must make concrete proposals to obtain funds for Peru, work and honor for the Huallaga Valley peasants, and respect for the Latin American countries, particularly since it is clear that the origin of the problem is in the consumers of the rich countries, especially the United States."

The suspension of that aid could form part of a negotiated agreement that would simultaneously entail a cease-fire ,""the communique stated . The Fmln's message coincided with President Alfredo Cristiani's visit to the United Nations, where today he will meet with Javier Perez de Cuellar to request his good offices to achieve the resumption of the talks with the rebels, which had been suspended in October . The guerrillas stated that they hope that Cristiani's meeting with Perez de Cuellar will lead to setting a date for a future meeting . Nevertheless, the Fmln recalled the 11 November offensive and warned that the government's insistence of the guerrillas' alleged military weakness``will only lead to greater levels of confrontation .""the guerrillas expressed their``concern""about the Salvadoran government and Army's rejection of Perez de Cuellar's mediation role, describing the rejection as``an obstacle to a procedure designed to bring seriousness to the negotiating effort .""`` on our part ,""the communique stated,``We accept that mediation and we have made efforts toward achieving it .""the Salvadoran government wants Perez de Cuellar to play only the role of observer in the dialogue process . Since Alfredo Cristiani took office on 1 June, the government and the Fmln have held two rounds of talks, the first in Mexico in September and the second in Costa Rica in October . The government maintains that the Fmln should give up its weapons and join the political process as a party . However, the guerrillas demand a purge of the armed forces and amendments to the Constitution in exchange for a cease-fire."

The legislative assembly is expected to discuss whether to continue this measure next week . Our stance is completely offensive throughout our national territory . We will maintain this policy whether there is a state of siege or not . the top military leader commented on the decision that the legislative assembly must make on 8 February . Col Ponce said that this is a political decision and whatever the legislative assembly decides will be respected by the armed forces . However, he noted that full guarantees for national security would be nonexistent if this measure is repealed . We will respect the decision of the institutions Tasked with making the decision . We believe that the situation is not yet normal enough to warrant the lifting of the state of siege . However, the decision is in the hands of the assembly or the government . Why do you believe that there are no conditions for lifting the state of siege? the plans of the Farabundo Marti National liberation front . The Fmln plans to continue its terrorist, selective, and indiscriminate actions, and its attacks in the capital and the countryside . I believe that there are no conditions . The situation is not yet normal . As for an offensive that the Fmln had planned for last week, the military leader said that it was foiled because Army intelligence detected it in time . Col Ponce added that the most recent guerrilla attacks in the capital aim to frighten civilians . We believe that the Fmln is seeking to maintain a psychology of fear and complete insecurity and distrust among the population, because this works in their favor . They are involved in a purely terrorist, selective, and indiscriminate scheme . I have mentioned the indiscriminate nature before . their recent attacks are selective . They seek to destabilize the government, create distrust in the government, and create insecurity . As for the Victoria and Martillo operations, Col Ponce said that the Fmln had sustained 2,352 dead from 11 November 1989 to 30 January 1990, and he regretted the death of 537 Army troops."

Benavides' replacement was part of a high-level reorganization in the armed forces which, according to Western diplomatic sources, reflects an intention to make gradual changes throughout the year, Benavides, who is accused of having given the order to kill the Jesuits, will be replaced as director of the military school by Col Ricardo Alfonso Casanova, who was formerly commander of the 6th infantry Brigade, based in the Eastern Usulutan Department . Col Heriberto Hernandez, who to date has been director of the Treasury police, will be transferred to Usulutan, a department where guerrillas are constantly active . Hernandez will be replaced by Col CIRO Lopez Roque . In addition to the military school and the Treasury police, the changes primarily affect commanders in the areas of persistent guerrilla activity, such as Usulutan and Chalatenango, and the Arce Battalion, an elite unit to combat the Farabundo Marti National liberation front, which is based in the Eastern Department of San Miguel . These transfers and appointments affect a total of 12 colonels and, although the armed forces described them today as``routine changes ,""diplomatic sources feel that they are designed to seek greater efficiency in military action . The sources feel that more changes will be made throughout this year . The first Reshuffling in the armed forces for 1990 was announced on 1 January, that is, shortly after the Fmln offensive, the scale of which surprised even the Army itself, as military sources admitted . on that date, General Rafael Bustillo, chief of the Salvadoran armed forces and one of the officers most openly opposed to dialogue with the Fmln, was relieved of his duties and sent to Europe as a military attache . replaced with Bustillo were the Chiefs of the military Detachments of Cuscatlan and La Union, in the central and Eastern parts of the country, respectively, and the chief of Army intelligence."
1085,DEV-MUC3-1086,CLANDESTINE,1990-02-02,"The Farabundo Marti National liberation front hereby Notifies the Salvadoran people and the international community of the following : 1 . We see as positive that Mr Cristiani has accepted UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar's participation in the negotiation process in El Salvador . We feel that the mediation of the UN Secretary General and the framework of that international organization seriously commit both parties to negotiation and offer true possibilities so that the process will lead toward a solution that will put an end to the war in our country . 2 . In view of these possibilities, it is highly negative that the Bush administration has announced that the economic and military assistance to the government will be increased in the forthcoming fiscal periods . If this decision is ratified by the U.S. Congress, it would mean a definite determination to prolong the war and the failure of the possibility that could lead to the negotiated solution of the Salvadoran conflict . The assistance strengthens the extremists . The political pressure makes it necessary to take political actions and strengthens the negotiated solution . 3 . The Army continues to carry out permanent military offensives and repression . There continue to be a state of siege, murders, arrests, and persecution against people's and religious organizations; the press continues to be controlled; and international agreements continue to be violated as the evacuation of Fmln war cripples is not allowed . Col Ponce openly proclaims his``victory and hammer""offensive against Fmln positions . This is not compatible, as the government wants the Fmln to unilaterally suspend operations . As long as there are repression and large military offensives, and a cease-fire is not agreed upon by the parties, we are obliged to remain at war and make offensive use of our military force in any part of the nation to achieve serious negotiation that will find a just solution to the war .

1086,DEV-MUC3-1087,TEGUCIGALPA,1990-02-02,"Some people naively think that a country curry favor with the U.S. just by being Democratic . Some people have placed themselves at the service of this superpower, as long as the superpower has had need of them . However, once they have outlived their usefulness, not only are they abandoned, but now they are even kidnapped, jailed, and sentenced . This happened to Perez Jimenez of Venezuela; Leonidas Trujillo of the Dominican Republic, who was murdered by the CIA; Somoza of Nicaragua; and lately Noriega of Panama . These men are valued only as long as they are useful to the United States . Once they are no longer useful, they are no longer regarded as men . Apparently something similar happens with countries . If a country has any political, military, or strategic value, that country will enjoy Washington's preference . However, once the interest no longer exists, the aid is over . If the interest decreases, the aid Decreses . Honduras is a typical example of this policy for the world to see . The Poindexter trial showed that over the Senate's objection, special aid was granted to Honduras in exchange for converting it into a leased territory for Contra operations . The years in which our territory shamefully served to shed blood in one our neighboring countries, are years in which Honduras was regarded as a country deserving military and economic aid . with the change of U.S. policy, after it accepted its military failure against Nicaragua, Honduras is no longer the apple of its eye, according to the United States . that is why the United States is not only Grudging its aid, but is not even granting the scant aid already approved, unless Honduras AGREES to additional conditions . There is something else . Since the United States is the IMF's most important member and supporter, it has asked the IMF to tighten the screws on Honduras, and to even let Honduras use up its meager gold reserves until Honduras is forced to say,``forgive me, master .""as we can recall, when the gold standard was abandoned for the dollar Standard and special drawing rights, the IMF, and other measures were created, each country deposited gold Reseves to back up its currency exchange . thereafter, its monetary backing would depend on its reserve of dollars and other strong currencies . that is how getting foreign reserves became the main concern of nations, if they wanted to maintain the parity of their currency . as a result of the oil crisis, which on the one hand saved the oil-producing countries, and on the other hand dealt a blow to the oil importers, plus the uncontrolled foreign debt that the Petrodollars boom brought with it, the countries went to the hilt in debt . at the same time they lost huge sums in the international markets because of the drop in the prices of coffee, silver, tin, copper, and other export products . In short, the source of exchange decreased for everyone, even though production of each item increased . debts grew until they became nightmares that absorbed almost all the country's foreign income . The monetary reserves that were backing the currencies fell . that is why in Latin America there has been one devaluation after another, country after country . in the beginning the IMF used what was called a stand-by loan, which helped countries when they ran short of reserves . with those emergency loans they could maintain the parity of their currency, until they could balance their reserves . However, countries like Honduras, which were deeply indebted, began to fill their lack of international reserves with loans and donations . Even so the country continued to pay its imports and expenses in foreign exchange, until it reached the current situation in which we cannot pay the debt . We are overdue $140 million in payments on our debt . Our credit is no longer good . The IMF has no more money to give to Honduras to continue its vicious cycle of getting into debt to pay off its debts . Yet the United States has asked the IMF to tighten our screws."
1087,DEV-MUC3-1088,BOGOTA,1990-02-04,"We are saying hello at this hour to North Santander governor Eduardo Assaf Elcure . Dr Assaf, good day . good morning, Rcn . Mr . Governor, what information does the departmental administration have about events dealing with public order, such as regrettable incident in Arboledas . The official reports on the regrettable case in Arboledas at noon today, and those carried by Rcn and other stations, describing the way in which Mayor Pedro Jesus Hernandez was murdered while inaugurating a dining hall for children at Juan Bueno, Arboledas municipality, lead us to believe that something extremely serious is happening . Hernandez was going to inaugurate on 20-25 February four or five works that are important for the development of the communities and had been demanded by them for a long time . This leads us to believe that the situation is really difficult and that other measures will have to be adopted to prevent a continuation of these regrettable actions, which destabilize public order in the Department . I think that after the peace talks with M-19 are concluded next week, Dr. Octavio Pardo should in some way promote a truce with the National liberation Army and the Epl to see if it is possible to begin a dialogue and keep the bloodshed from continuing in our country, most particularly in our Department . over the course of a month, two Mayors, who were characterized as the Fightingest mayors--in the sense that they launched, executed, and completed works--have been killed in our Department . Mr . Governor, how many mayors did you say have been killed during that time? What did you say? Mr . Governor, do you believe that, for instance, civic or political leaders in the area of North Santander can participate in talks with the Epl and the ELN to make serious proposals to the government about a possible truce, as you suggest? in view of our current situation, that is, in view of the fact that a month ago the Mayor of Abrego was killed and the Arboledas Mayor was killed yesterday, I believe that the country is pleased that the pacification process with M-19 will end this week . So, why not look for avenues of communication with the and the Epl to establish a truce, at least during this electoral period, so that all COLOMBIANS, especially those of North Santander, can freely exercise their sovereign right to participate in an election and express their satisfaction with or condemnation of the people who are currently governing the municipalities?"
1088,DEV-MUC3-1089,NO CITY,,"You have already heard the opinion, for example, of the agrarian Bank, probably also that of Enci, Casa, the Cora project . The Coca growers issued a communique a few days ago stating that they are not against the eradication of Coca plantations but complaining about the agrarian bank's unsatisfactory service in granting loans . This communique was published by the media a few days ago . Yes, we heard about this and are analyzing it . But the problem of the 200,000 hectares used for illegal Coca growing by far exceeds the capacity of the agrarian Bank, of the National Coca leaf enterprise, or the Enci to finance fertilizer . This is a subject that must be discussed at the Continental level . The Huallaga Valley is an enclave of the U.S. consumers . It is a perverse problem with economic repercussions and it is distorting and destroying the possibility of our planting other crops in that area . This is why we must consider it from a Continental viewpoint, discussing it with the country where the problem originates, where it is consumed . The Enci and the agrarian Bank problem is important, but it is very small in comparison to the seriousness of the overall problem . Mr. President, is it true--as it was said in the United States--that the Peruvian government is refusing to replace the plantations because it is not economically convenient? no, according to solid information I have at hand from the State Department and the Department in charge of drug trafficking, our government has made the greatest efforts during the past few years to eradicate Coca plantations . a few months ago they released a report to the U.S. media from May 1989 that showed that Peru had broken all records for Eradicating Coca in 1988, in keeping with its international agreements . Peru eradicated more than 5,000 hectares of Coca plantations that year, thus stabilizing the overall amount of hectares used for Coca growing . Nobody, much less the United States, can say that Peru has done nothing . We have carried out vast operations and have continued our silent task to eradicate these Plantations, sometimes with regrettable consequences . The peasant who is faced with bare land after the Coca is uprooted either engages in terrorist activities or is condemned to live in misery . This is why we need an overall economic and social development alternative that must be part of a Reevaluated Latin American-U.S . relationship . Mr. President, the situation is now the opposite to what the United States is doing for a meeting put forward by the Presidents, because they give $1 to fight drug trafficking while there are $100 for consumption . You are right . It is believed that the total cost of cocaine sold on the U.S . streets is $100 billion . only $8 or $9 million is being offered to fight the illegal production of Coca and to replace the crops here in Peru . what the United States--the main consumer--has been offering is not proportional to the magnitude of the problem . If there were no consumption in the United States, Peru would not produce Coca leaves, except for the traditional, ancient uses of Peruvian people . The problem begins there . The responsibility for providing massive resources should be assumed through concerted dialogue, not unilateral measures, because there are hawks in the United States . The hawks are the boldest Militarists who believe that troops can be sent to the Huallaga Valley, thus solving this serious problem . such an action would represent the violation of a nation's sovereignty, an unwanted unilateral intervention . We want a serious, responsible, concerted, far-reaching socioeconomic policy . This is our objective for Cartagena . Mr. President, changing the subject, the electoral campaign has entered the final stretch . opposition parties have constantly mentioned your name and what you have said or have not said . What is your opinion of the campaign? those are minor sins by the opposition . They are using elements that are not totally legitimate, but I will not waste my time passing judgment on my dear friend Enrique Chirino Soto or on any of the lawmakers . I understand their desire and their need to be elected . Otherwise what would they do in the future? If they want to use my name, let them use it, even if it's in a negative way . I have listened to so many things over four and a half years in office that I am actually a little pleased by the fact that they are desperately using my name . at least I am helping them . Since the elections will be held on 8 April, when will school classes begin? I saw that the education Ministry issued a note announcing that classes will begin on 1 or 2 April . I would like to propose to the education Minister that classes begin after 8 April . It would be meaningless to begin classes and to then discontinue them in order to open the schools for the elections . classes could therefore begin on 10 April or when the Ministry decides . This should be after 8 April . We should concentrate all of our efforts on opening the voting sites . I am announcing that classes will begin after 8 April."
1089,DEV-MUC3-1090,TEGUCIGALPA,1990-02-06,"President Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero said Tuesday Honduras is facing an extremely challenging situation and the Republic of China can help a great deal in solving the problems confronting his country . Callejas, inaugurated on Jan. 27, told the Cna Honduras is facing a crisis which his new administration, with help and support from the Republic of China, will be able to tide over . Honduras lacks foreign exchange to buy oil, medicine and food from abroad . Tegucigalpa's foreign debts total well over U.S. dlrs 200 million .``We are facing a steep shortage of basic foods, corn in particular ,""Callejas said . A potentially rich country, Honduras can overcome all its difficult problems and achieve prosperity in the long run, but it needs a shot in the arm, Callejas said . The Republic of China, Callejas appealed, can extend``short-term bridge loans""to Honduras to help solve the problems of acute shortage in food and other necessities .``a short-term credit of dlrs 5 million, for instance, can help us make up for the shortage and then we can move ahead ,""Callejas said .``the situation is a critical one ,""Callejas said,``But we will be able to cope with it and surge ahead for greater prosperity, and what we now need is a short-term help from our friends in the Republic of China .""he said the people of Honduras have yet to sense the crisis they are facing now . The financial crisis, in particular, is comparable to the one the Republic of China faced in and shortly after 1950 .``my administration knows what shall be done ,""Callejas said . He will let the people fully understand the crisis and cultivate a sense of crisis that is needed to rally themselves behind the government to move forward . The people of the Republic of China have set a``good example""for other nations in crisis to follow, Callejas said .``over the past 40 years ,""he pointed out,``You have demonstrated what can be done to overcome the difficulties and achieve prosperity .""aside from the short-term credit, the Republic of China can send a high-level mission to advise Honduras on how to solve its long-term financial problem, Callejas said .``your country has experience in this field ,""he added,``and we hope we will benefit from your experience .""another field of cooperation between the two countries is trade and investment, Callejas said . Honduras is setting up an industrial Park, and investment from the Republic of China is more than welcome, he added . The Republic of China is opening its market to foreign imports, and a small percentage of Taiwan's tobacco market, if Honduras can earn it,``will help a great deal and start a chain action of development ,""Callejas said . The foreign exchange generated from the sales of tobacco can be used to pay back some of Tegucigalpa's foreign debt . The repayment will earn more international credit, which in turn supports other projects of development . The presence of a U.N. military observer group in Honduras, Callejas said, will help stabilize the situation in Central America . The mission is to help ease the tension along the borders of El Salvador and Nicaragua, which was heightened by guerrilla activities . Callejas has visited the Republic of China twice before . He toured the Republic of China as Minister of natural resources in 1968 and again as chairman of the National party in 1988 . Asked if he would attend the Presidential Inauguration in Taipei on May 20, Callejas said he would``try my best to go myself .""if he is unable to attend, he added, he will send his president of the National Congress, Rodolfo Irias Navas .``If I cannot visit the Republic of China in May ,""Callejas said,``I will make a visit to your country before the end of this year .""most likely, he added, he will pay a state visit to the Republic of China in November . In return, Callejas said,``We will be honored to have your President, president Li, visit us .""relations between Honduras and the Republic of China are``extremely close ones ,""Callejas said .``and we in Honduras hope to further cement those extremely good relations ,""he pointed out . Such good relationships should not be monopolized by the governments, Callejas said .``We need more contact among the people in all walks of life, on cultural, social and commercial levels, so that we may continue improving the extremely good relationship that has existed between our two countries ,""he pointed out."

The President was asked about the human rights situation in our country . In addition, presented by the United Nations Rapporteur of the UN human rights Commission . of the Commission that has arrived in Guatemala . We all must admit that in 1989 there was that created an atmosphere of terrorism and . On various occasions and in several criminal and political cases, it was decided that that continues progressing, but there is an even better way yet . The truth of the matter is that the institutions that are going to protect human rights are making more progress each day and becoming more operational . The authorities are becoming more cooperative every day with the various institutions that are concerned about the human rights situation . to create a new system for locating missing people . We have found a system that allows us to locate many missing people, and . . frankly speaking, is a serious man who deserves all of my trust and respect for his capabilities . He has said that we have problems in controlling some terrorist groups, and what we need is assistance in improving our efficiency . He has pointed out some defects in our penal procedures which make it difficult for us to keep these people in prison . However, his conclusions do not necessarily mean that we are getting worse . that has not been mentioned in the news . His conclusions notes that in spite of these observations that he had to make as United Nations observer for Guatemala, the situation in our country has obviously improved, compared to the previous years . We are taking all of this into consideration . This has been included in a written report that will be noted in Geneva in order to consider treatment for Guatemala."
1091,DEV-MUC3-1092,GUATEMALA CITY,1990-01-24,"A Socialist International mission, made up of prominent leaders of that organization, arrived in the country on 23 January to``demand""that the Guatemalan government conduct an exhaustive investigation into the murder of Salvadoran opposition leader Hector Oqueli Colindres and Guatemalan Gilda Flores . their kidnapping and subsequent murder took place in our country and thus, Guatemalan authorities, without any kind of meddling, should solve this case . Guatemalan courts of justice have the duty to request, as part of the investigation, the Testimonies of witnesses and conclusions of experts involved in the case . According to Guatemalan law, there is a period allotted for initial investigations during which no public statements can be made or pressures exerted which might hamper the course of justice . This is why the fact that a delegation, which is made up of respectable people who deserve our admiration, not only because of their outstanding political virtues, but also because of their honest behavior as citizens, is coming to``demand""that our authorities investigate the crime, as if they were not already officially doing so, is to a certain extent hampering justice . It happens that the illustrious visitors came here with the evident goal of accusing the alleged authors of the double crime . in public statements, they have already said that``forces of the Guatemalan and Salvadoran extreme right""murdered them . These statements are as uncalled for as those uttered by President Cristiani in El Salvador when he said that the murderers of the six Uca Jesuits were Fmln guerrillas and was later forced to retract, when the investigations revealed that members of the Salvadoran armed forces carried out the murder . in the face of domestic and international pressure, and the Comdemnation of the brutal murder of the social Democratic leaders, president Cerezo decided to establish an investigative Commission to which he plans to add a representative of an international organization . On 23 January the Socialist delegate who is in the country clearly referred to a legally registered Guatemalan political party, which enjoys full political rights, as the``Nanny""party of the Nationalist Republican alliance, arena, of El Salvador . He is levelling serious charges, which could even create legal and political conflicts between Guatemala and El Salvador, by insisting that the crime was politically motivated, which seems to be evident, and by linking the crime to political parties of the two countries . with the due respect that the Presidential Commission deserves, the Supreme Court of justice should be consulted about what should be done next because the case is under the Purview of Guatemalan courts, especially those in Jutiapa jurisdiction . Those courts should be the ones Tasked with collecting the evidence, issuing the summons, and making the necessary statements . anything else constitutes interfering with justice . In this regard, the fact that President Cerezo is guessing about who might be the author of this Repudiable bloody murder is inappropriate because it is not his duty to do so, even if the socialists threaten to seek condemnation against Guatemala at the United Nations for violations of human rights which are looming over his government."
1092,DEV-MUC3-1093,SAN SALVADOR,1990-02-07,"Colonel Rene Emilio Ponce, chief of the armed forces joint Chiefs of staff, categorically denied today that there are any Rifts between Salvadoran Army officers and U.S. military advisers, as asserted this week by the U.S. media .``I know nothing about this . Our relations with the North Americans are normal as usual ,""Ponce said to journalists, adding,``the U.S. advisers have helped us very much in the Professionalization of the armed forces, and they continue to work with us .""the military officer stated:``There are always those who try to force or break the strategic alliance between the Salvadoran government and armed forces and the United States .""reports from the U.S. Congress said that the arrest of eight Army members linked with the assassination of six Jesuit priests and two women on 16 November has provoked serious disputes between some military commanders and the U.S. adviser Corps detached to the country .

1093,DEV-MUC3-1094,MANAGUA ,1990-02-05,"During the last few days, the Presidential candidate for Continuism, Daniel Ortega, has been insisting on his intention of a quick reconciliation with the U.S. government . Nevertheless, he says so amid Slander and threats that invalidate the sincerity of his remarks . For Ortega and his spokesmen, to be respected by the U.S. government and to manage an agreement with the United States is now his party's``best guarantee ,""that party's great electoral offer . The only possible explanation for this incoherent and contradictory attitude is as a reelection strategy, realizing the popularity of the idea of Normalizing friendly relations with the Bush administration . Ortega has not wanted to remain distanced from that aspiration, which the people judge as indispensable to improve the crisis they are in . The truth is that any unnecessary distancing of relations between the U.S. government and the Sandinists was due to the latter's initiative . Everyone knows the efforts made by both Mr Bowdler as well as Lawrence Pezullo to attain cordial relations with the Sandinist government that followed Somoza Debayle's . The strong pressures on the dictator to resign were decisive in his departure . The Carter government's massive and early aid was decisive in stabilizing the revolutionary regime . The Fsln national directorate, however, had other instructions from Havana . As soon as they got out of the airplane, they took it out on the``Yankees, enemy of humanity ,""which were only seeking an Unprejudiced relationship with the new leaders . that rhetoric would have been less obvious if it had not been that the true purpose of that confrontation campaign was to justify its mission of setting Central America on fire and thus distracting the United States with a strategy of destabilizing the area, which is convenient to USSR interests . The Fmln's general staff moved to Niacaragua, and the clandestine radio station Venceremos began Broadcasting from Managua while the whole country became a sanctuary for Salvadoran terrorists and a logistics Resupply base . The U.S. administration made one last effort at Manzanillo, but Deputy foreign minister Tinoco only went to read a prepared text, using that brilliant opportunity as a center stage for propaganda and disturbance . Menawhile, the slogan``If Nicaragua won, so will El Salvador ,""flooded radio stations, banners, Watchwords, graffiti, and Boastful speeches, while the Salvadoran guerrillas made every effort to overthrow the government and the Guatemalan revolutionary bands did likewise, devastating El Peten . Deputy Secretary of state Enders came himself to hold talks with the Fsln's general directorate, proposing an arrangement that would guarantee stability in exchange for their Messiah-Like project of subverting the region . When these talks failed, what followed was inevitable and is regrettable . Now, even though the Sandinists may try after 10 years to make up for lost time, trying to put things right, the recipe continues to be the same: one,``genuinely free and just""elections in Nicaragua, and two, the removal of their inciting hands from Central America . on these lines, Secretary of state James Baker's declaration last week was clear and categorical: convincing proof that the elections were honest,``something very hard to determine, unless Ortega allows Congressinal observers ,""and Convicing proof that Nicaragua has stopped sending arms to El Salvador . If the elections are fraudulent, sentence has already been passed:``the United States could make Nicaragua's situation tougher .""in other words, Ortega would confirm himself only as a Guarantor of war and misery."

He said that these attacks will not hinder the talks on the transfer of power . He added that he did not have full reports on the subversive attack . I think it is normal, a situation in keeping with the Dynamics of current politics . I do not foresee greater consequences to it . When I get back there possibly Mr. President, there has been a terrorist attack in the capital, what do you know about it? I cannot tell you, I have been told over the phone, but it is confidential information which I cannot repeat, but I do not think it is too serious . Mr. President, that does not break away . According to what I know so far, nothing has happened that could turn into anything more serious . things are going along just the same, with the small problems that arise daily within the Dynamics of politics, but as I just said, I do not think . Mr. President, do you think that this attack was committed by those who escaped from the Santiago prison? that is what I mean; I do not think it is very important since reactions of violence have increased . It could have been them . According to the information I got, it could be serious but not as much as to think that this is the end of the world . Finally, president Pinochet said he still had no further reports on the terrorist attack in which another Carabinero was Slain, and he regretted the dissolution of the CNI which was a specialized organization well acquainted with the terrorist cells . The chief of state will end his tour of northern Chile in Serena . He will return to Santiago today."

In answer to a question as to what will happen with the Good-Neighbor committees in his country after he steps down due to the change in administration in Colombia, Londono said:``the Colombian Commission--and I know the Venezuelan Commission too--is Multipartisan . I know it includes representatives from the liberal party and its various factions, from the conservative party, and also from the patriotic Union .

Although he did not specify the kind of aid or how it should be provided, Barco Vargas said the economic measures he will ask for would concentrate on a greater opening of the U.S. market to exports from Andean countries affected by production and chemical processing of cocaine . In addition to Presidents Bush and Barco, Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora and Peruvian President Alan Garcia will also attend the summit . They are expected to present proposals on the substitution of other crops for Coca leaves--the base for making cocaine--while bearing in mind the economic well-being and social development of peasants engaged in this activity . The four Presidents will meet for no longer than five hours and will sign a document in which they will define strategies to develop an overall struggle against drug trafficking . According to unofficial reports, the points that will be included in the joint document include strengthening Andean economies by increasing exports, and the``total struggle""against international Drug-Trafficking gangs by reducing demand, consumption, and supply of Hallucinogenic drugs .

1110,DEV-MUC3-1111,LONDON ,1990-02-15,"Britain and Argentina tonight agreed to resume full diplomatic relations which were broken off in 1982 after the invasion of the Falkland Islands . The announcement was made tonight in London, Buenos Aires and Madrid, where two days of talks between senior officials have hammered out the deal . The foreign office stressed the decision would have no effect on British sovereignty of the Falklands, where 1,000 Britons were killed and wounded during the war . Britain has agreed to lift the 150-Mile military protection zone around the Falklands from March 31 . at the same time new mutually agreed security arrangements will come into force . These will involve 25 days advance notification by each side of military manoeuvres in certain areas . It has also been agreed there should be 48-Hours notice for naval ships which want to approach closer to the coast than 50 nautical miles and 70 nautical miles for aircraft . full diplomatic relations will come into force as soon as the protecting powers for the two countries have been informed . Britain's interests in Argentina have been represented by Switzerland since 1982 . Argentina's interests in London have been represented by Brazil from the same period . talks on Fisheries around the Falklands will continue . A working group on South Atlantic affairs is to be set up . its first meeting will take place within the next 12 months . An Argentine visit to war Cemeteries in the Falklands will be allowed to go ahead . This will be worked out through the International Red Cross . both sides have also agreed that Visas requirements will be abolished . Britain and Argentina have also agreed to cooperate on drugs and the environment . The British delegation to the talks was led by Sir Crispin Tickell, Ambassador to the United Nations and the Argentine delegation by Senor Garcia del solar, special representative of President Carlos Menem . The agreement is the outcome of a series of contacts between the two countries over the past few months . in October, it was agreed to establish consular relations . Air links between Buenos Aires and London resumed a few weeks ago . a party of British MPs and prominent public figures have just returned from Buenos Aires after the Inaugural flight by British Airways . An obstacle to the resumption of relations over the past few years was the Argentine refusal to declare that hostilities between the two countries were at an end . However, the Newly-Elected Argentine government made clear last year that such hostilities could now be considered at an end . Britain, after talks last October, agreed to raise no obstacles to Argentine efforts to establish closer trading relations with the European Community . The Argentine economy is now seen to be in a severe plight . President Menem has watched his popularity decline as Argentina inflation has remained at a high level . Britain and Argentina will also establish a direct communication link between their respective military authorities . The purpose is to reduce the possibility of incidents and to limit their consequences if such incidents should occur . According to the statement, this Hotline will increase common knowledge of military activities in the South Atlantic . The link will be under the supervision of the Argentine and British foreign ministries . British ministers have made clear that adequate defence arrangements will be maintained for the Falklands . Foreign office Minister Timothy Sainsbury returned to London last weekend after a visit to the Falklands where he reassured Islanders there was no weakening in Britain's commitment to their defence . Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd tonight described the agreement with Argentina as``very satisfactory""and that it``underlines the fact that we have no quarrel with Argentina"". He said:``This has been achieved without any sacrifice of sovereignty . I hope it is a turning point that will lead to a new relationship between Britain and Argentina .""Mr Hurd told reporters at the foreign office:``I hope that trade between Britain and Argentina can be accelerated . It is for the Falkland Islanders to decide on their own contacts with the mainland .""asked if the instability in Argentina might lead to a new attempt to seize the Falklands, he said:``I think that is becoming less and less likely .""he expressed appreciation that the readiness of the government in Argentina to make this advance which Britain had Reciprocated .``the outcome is very satisfactory ,""he said . The British protection zone had been replaced``with something from a security point of view that is better . We have replaced it with an advance notification system on the approach of ships and aircraft . that from a security viewpoint is an improvement .""he hoped that the agreement would be well received in the Falklands and noted that the Falkland Islanders had already been given an assurance of Britain's continued commitment . The exchange of ambassadors and the ending of Visas would take place quite soon . Asked if sovereignty of the Falklands could ever be discussed with Argentina he said:``I do not see how that can be discussed by us given the history and principle that is involved .""labour welcomed the move to resume full diplomatic relations . Mr George Foulkes, a front bench spokesman on foreign affairs, said it meant the two countries were now almost back to their respective positions before the 1982 conflict .

1111,DEV-MUC3-1112,LA PAZ,1990-02-09,"The Santa Cruz preparatory meeting was held under strict security measures and its conclusions have been kept under strict secrecy . This veil of secrecy seemed to have been lifted when the morning newspaper Hoy published a long agenda under the heading``total war against drug trafficking .""the government, however, has neither confirmed nor rejected the authenticity of the report . . at a meeting at the interior Minister's office on 31 January, the minister told Coca producers that Hoy did not report the preliminary agenda...and that the President's criterion of``Coca in return for development""has prevailed . If this is the case, and if there is consensus on this position, why hasn't the country been informed? the situation has been further complicated by the remarks by Peruvian President Alan Garcia, who said that``when everything seemed to have been agreed upon""one of the countries introduced changes that have``changed the structural features of the issue .""what is this new concept? is it about sovereignty or independence? the Progovernment propaganda has Monotonously reiterated over the past few days that to govern means to inform . fine . We agree that to inform is part of the art of governing . to inform, however, also means to tell the truth, especially if it deals with an issue that is fundamental to the future of Bolivians . The government should be consistent, at least with this principle . President Jaime Paz Zamora has repeatedly proposed the replacement of Coca production through development programs . Yet the remarks by U.S. Embassy deputy chief of mission Marilyn Mcafee have dealt an anticipated blow that has caused some officials to hesitate .``There is $15 million for replacement ,""she said . . barely Recuperated from his surprise, the foreign minister said that the U.S. help is a``bilateral issue and, consequently, it will not be directly addressed""at the Cartagena summit . The interior Minister, who has more experience in this type of situation, did not attach much importance to Mcafee's statement and stressed that``more exact figures will be mentioned at the Cartagena summit .""who is telling the truth? will the Cartagena summit address the economic aid? after this peculiar situation, the United States seems to have chosen interdiction and eradication--repression--to fight drug trafficking . The strategy of``war against drug trafficking terrorists""has prevailed . This strategy lends itself to Interventionist military policies, similar to the presence of U.S. marines in Bolivia in the past, or, in the future, the creation of a multinational military force that would jeopardize regional political and military stability . When the trafficking of cocaine was carried out as a covert operation involving the CIA and the U.S. Army--for the purpose of providing military supplies to the Contras--cocaine trafficking was not a crime . The links between Noriega and drug trafficking were a matter of secondary importance as long as he provided information and support for their war against Nicaragua . But now the United States does not mind invading Panama or turning Colombia into an inferno to capture Noriega or some of the major Colombian traffickers on this crusade against drug trafficking . that is the U.S. government's Double-Faced morality . Another scandal hit U.S. society last week . Marion Barry, the Mayor of Washington, the capital of the Empire and also the capital of crime, was caught in an FBI trap . He was filmed consuming cocaine . His followers claim that it is a white conspiracy to prevent a black Mayor from running for another term . But the interesting point for us is the controversy between Bennett, the U.S. government strategist for the struggle against drug trafficking, and Washington police chief Fulwood . While Bennett has questioned the efficiency of the Washington police, claiming that this area receives the largest amount of Federal support for the struggle against drug trafficking, Fulwood has said that Bennett is wasting time``talking without doing absolutely anything"". The Newsweek journalist said that even before the Barry scandal it was possible to see that the Bennett plan had become``only a dirty battle of words .""Bennett's strategy for the prevention and repression of drug abuse in the United States has been a total failure . Bennett therefore believes that the best way to cover his failure is to turn toward Latin America to relieve the fury of his impotence, ordering warships and planes to control Maritime and air traffic . As usual, those of us who live in the``backyard""have to pay for the mistakes of U.S. policy . This is not a story of suspense . The suspense has been created by the attitude of the government . the country needs to know the conclusions of the Santa Cruz summit . otherwise we will have to accept that a smoke screen has been deployed over the Cartagena summit."

I think that is unjust and should be discussed as a whole . The United States has...changes thought what more does it want, if it has the resources that it no longer spends on atomic bombs or on men and weapons in Europe? it has to invest those resources so that they may yield something . where? in Poland? in Czechoslovakia? Why? Why not in Latin America? we are here and we have common problems like drug trafficking . that is what we have to discuss . What are Peru's revenues, in dollars, for the Coca crops? the most conservative estimate is approximately $700 million . with what are you going to replace that $700 million if the Coca crops are abolished? that is the crux of the problem and that is why we came to talk . It is obvious, it is true that I have an ethical and moral obligation to end it, but it is also true that I have to eliminate the peasants' Coca crops to achieve this . Mr. President, what about the peasants of Peru and Bolivia? Colombia's case is different because Coca is processed here . would the peasants be willing to change those crops for others? If they are given a long-term guarantee, yes . but would they change Coca for tomatoes, oranges, and cacao? it is not easy to change it for coffee, tobacco, cacao, Annatto, or palm trees . The U.S. government has studied all this . I have a 600-Page report from the U.S. government that discusses the alternatives for replacing the 80,000 hectares in the Guayaga Valley--which is the largest Coca-Producing area in the country . It would cost $600 million to Industrialize the area on a long-term basis . But, Mr. President, Coca practically grows wild; it does not require much work in the countryside . How can a government like yours convince a farmer to invest much more money in a product that would be much less profitable? let me add something to that...excuse me . It is a vicious circle . The peasant produces Coca because he has no money . I will not ask him to invest money he does not have to change the product . The United States has to buy the new product to achieve this . The United States has to guarantee that it will buy the product . look, how many trillions does the United States buy as imports in other countries? a fraction of this would change the destiny of Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia . The United States should say: if I buy $600 billion in products abroad, I will buy $10 billion--of anything--in Peru, Colombia, and Bolivia . It could be tomatoes, palm oil, coffee, chocolate bars, anything . This would change the history of these countries."
1113,DEV-MUC3-1114,NO CITY,,"I have spent the last six years of my political life saying things clearly . many people describe that attitude as vehemence or radicalism . I disagree with that view . When the United States invaded Panama--and I was aware of what Noriega was--I said that despite that fact, the invasion had been a crime . We demanded the immediate withdrawal of the U.S . troops . I said that if the immediate withdrawal did not take place, I would not attend the Cartagena summit, because I could not sit at the same table with the U.S. President while a Latin American country remained invaded . and it happened . It happened . The troops had to withdraw . and we have held a cordial meeting for that reason . Mr President, you have convinced us things the way you see and feel about them . will you tell us frankly--frankly--what is your opinion of the summit? What happened at the summit? What important conclusions were reached at the summit? frankly, and in a nutshell, it was positive . It created a multilateral atmosphere, and we talked very candidly . As for me personally, I had the opportunity to meet a Continental politician like Bush, and I found him to be a pragmatic person . I probably disagree with him on more than half of the things he thinks, but I do not think that human beings are obliged to be identical . What is important is to look at each person for his good points--however few or many they may be--to establish a rapport on that basis . What is being planned? What is next? What is going to be done to continue...in order for the Presidents to keep in constant touch to fulfill what they signed? well, there will be constant communication . It is easy to talk with the U.S. President, who is not God . There are telephones to do that . Mr. Bell invented a little gadget over a century ago called the telephone and we, the Presidents, communicate with each other--with Barco, Paz Zamora, and President Bush, to ask: will we or will we not do what we pledged to do? If we do not, at least it will not be my fault or that of the Latin Americans . We are in the midst of an electoral process in Colombia, and the Peruvian President is also facing an electoral process...and you know the candidate, Fortunately . Mr. President, it looks like the opposition is going to defeat you in your country? it is a possibility, it is true . Why? look, anyone who listens to your question would think that five years ago, when I assumed power, Peru was a country full of gold, very rich, the way it was before the Spanish conquest--orderly, and without problems . five years ago it had a developed terrorist problem . It had a foreign debt of 14.5 billion and was extremely poor . five years have elapsed . I explained to you once that I tried to make it grow at great speed and managed to do so . Then we faced a decline, and we are now stabilizing the situation . However, many people feel that a person can solve many things because of the Impetuosity in his personality . Sometimes this is the problem of being honest or having an impetuous personality or harboring many hopes--or selling them . The truth is that--like five years ago--we have a poor country, a country that owes money, a country that has just as much or more subversive terrorism, and this makes people uncomfortable . I cannot understand it . However, that is what we politicians are for--to burn out in our work for democracy to survive . I will be replaced by someone else who thinks like me or totally different from me . He will replace me and democracy will stay, a civilized system . This is the most important thing."

North Vietnamese advisers--one of them is now a Vietnamese general, but the meeting was attended by Vietnamese and Cuban generals basically--met with subversive leaders and discussed the strategic plan for the central American area under the current situation they are suffering .

Cristiani said that in the latter case there have been no pressures and that from the moment that there was news about the tragedy, the Commission that investigates criminal acts was ordered to undertake the appropriate investigation to determine the cause of the tragedy . He said it concluded that the tragedy was caused by a helicopter rocket, but there was no bombing, although the civilians were victims of war actions .

1128,DEV-MUC3-1129,SANTIAGO,1990-02-05,"On the evening of 20 May 1986, the Jenka, a Danish cargo ship with an empty hold, was anchored in Valparaiso Bay . The ship, which was specially fitted to carry weapons, had been``waiting into line""for 120 days, meaning--in port operation jargon--that it was waiting for its turn or for the arrival of its cargo . The Five-Man crew was uneasy . They were waiting for a shipment of 400``wasp""cluster bombs produced by Ferrimar--a subsidiary of Famae--and bound for the Middle East . The destination of the shipment was Iran . The users: the armed forces of Imam Ruhollah Khomeini . The secret shipment was having problems on land . The five crew members made a decision that night, taking on fuel and food and fleeing toward Panama . in the dark no one noticed the ship's departure, not the shipping company that was in charge of the ship nor the port's captain--a Navy officer who was supposed to authorize the move . The Jenka left an unpaid debt of $30,000 owed to the shipping company . the case was reported by the press and Ferrimar rushed to say that it was selling weapons to Pakistan and Nigeria . It was also said that the government, for ethical reasons, would not allow the enterprise to offer the``wasp""bombs to Iran . In fact, Chilean businessman Carlos Cardoen was already selling``clusters""to Iraq . doing business at the expense of the two sides confronting each other in the long Persian Gulf war was not considered appropriate . The deal, however, was attractive because there could be millions of dollars in profits . countries like Brazil and the USSR were known to be selling weapons to both Iran and Iraq . The USSR was directly selling weapons to Iraq and supplying Iran through middlemen . Chile knew of a similar example: during the Beagle channel conflict, which almost ended in a war with Argentina, Israel sold missiles to both sides . Therefore, in a carefully planned operation, Ferrimar and Famae were able to sell cluster bombs to Iran . The middleman would be Frenchman Bernard Stroiazzo, the same person who three years later would cause the``Iran-Corfo""scandal . It is only now that Stroiazzo's history has been made public . An engineer hired by Iran's National Petroleum company, he served as a representative of Ferrimar and Famae to the Iranian government in the sale of cluster bombs in 1986 . After two shipments of defective bombs, the Iranians decided that they could cause more casualties among their own men than among enemy troops . Stroiazzo was taken hostage for 18 months . He managed to leave and traveled to Chile . with the help of CNI director brigadier general Hugo Salas, he contacted Corfo officials who helped him arrange compensation . He arranged a preliminary accord for establishing a toxic waste recycling plant in Chile, but the deal failed . He then filed a lawsuit against Corfo in the 19th civil court of Santiago . Corfo has not yet been notified of the lawsuit . The problem, at least as far as the toxic waste plant is concerned, will be inherited by the new government--which will take over on 11 March--and by Corfo . did Ferrimar lie to the Chilean government? this enterprise was known to have good contacts with the authorities . Among the partners of Ferrimar owner Aldo Pesce were retired General Manuel Contreras Sepulveda, former chief of the National intelligence directorate, Dina; General Raul Reyes, Famae director, and Colonel Carlos Carreno, who was a Famae executive and an adviser to Ferrimar on the production of the``wasp""bombs . to export its bombs, Ferrimar needed the authorization of the defense and foreign ministries . The company had to provide what is known in the International weapons market is known as an``End-User certificate""or``Final-User certificate .""Ferrimar got one . It was signed in August 1985 by a Nigerian Army officer who, according to sources close to the case, had retired a long time ago . a``Triangle operation""was carried out to conceal the true operation . It is not known whether the defense Ministry has indicted anyone over the deception by which it was victimized . at the end of January 1986, the first 100 bombs were shipped by plane to Bandar Abbas airport in Iran . Each bomb weighed 227 kg and contained 248 ammunition packages, some of them for immediate discharge and others for delayed action . These were capable of mining large areas for up to 72 hours after a battle . The first shipment was worth $7 million; $1 million was for Stroiazzo and $1.5 million went for the cost of the bombs . The price of the bombs abroad was $14,000 each, but their real cost was only $3,000 . The Chilean contact in this operation, Fernando Perez, was to have received $4.5 million . a test was performed in Iran and the bombs did not work . The Iranian defense Ministry asked that new tests be carried out in Chile."

1133,DEV-MUC3-1134,MOSCOW ,1990-02-18,"The annals of the Colombian port of Cartagena list three extremely fierce Sieges . back in 1586, the``jewel of the Caribbean""was captured by Sir Francis Drake, who did not burn the city to the ground only because he received a ransom of 10 million pesos . a century later Cartagena was occupied by the French . Finally, in 1741, the city's defenders successfully fought off an assault by a host of 27,000 Pirates headed by Sir Edward Vernon...the Western press described the meeting between the Presidents of the United States, Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru held a few days ago in Cartagena as a kind of assault . Despite some exaggeration, this graphic description was based on perfectly serious grounds . After all, the conference did discuss immediate tasks and even a detailed schedule for a joint offensive by the governments of these countries against criminal drug trafficking, which ranks first in the Pecking order of crime . It is indeed necessary to launch an assault against the drug mafia's strongholds, whether in Medellin,``famous""for unbridled Gangsterism, or in Cartagena itself, whose status as a resort is threatened by the Selfsame``cocaine barons .""as a matter of fact, this tourist center has been repeatedly shaken in recent months by the explosions of bombs planted by terrorists in the``Hilton""hotel, in stores, or at its marinas . It is no wonder, as Reuter reports, that not a single cruise ship has dropped anchor there this season . Yes, the situation is highly alarming, and this applies to the whole of Colombia and even to the entire region . In these conditions the firm resolve displayed by the participants in the Cartagena meeting deserves understanding and support: the resolve to finally pool their efforts in the struggle against organized crime and to jointly place a reliable barrier in its path . These are the intentions shown in the joint statement signed by the four Presidents and by the series of special documents . The aim of these agreements is noble indeed: to besiege the drug mafia in its nests, to cut off the``laundering""of drug dollars, and to deprive the merchants of``slow death""of broad access to the``black market""in the United States, where, as a matter of fact, the lion's share of South America's poisonous export is consumed . In other words, an important step has been taken to combat one of the main``evils of the 20th century ,""and it was not for nothing that the meeting's results were positively appraised by UN Secretary General J. Perez de Cuellar . Here is a different question: emphasis in Cartagena was placed on administrative and police measures and on Washington's primarily Militarized forms of cooperation with the Andean States, but does this conform with their long-term national interests, with their desire to put an end to Backwardness and attain a qualitatively new level of socioeconomic development? after all, a radical solution of the drug problem primarily demands neither combat aircraft not armored personnel carriers, but something quite different . It is necessary to change the economic profile of vast provinces where the cultivation of Coca and marijuana is the sole source of the population's existence . true enough, the United States has now expressed readiness to assist also in this sphere . on the other hand, there is an almost total lack of readiness to import from South America the crops which could, in principle, squeeze out Coca and marijuana . It was not for nothing that Colombia's president Virgilio Barco, the White House's closest ally in the struggle against drugs, was forced to declare in Cartagena that the U.S. government's rigid protectionist measures are jeopardizing the very future of``alternative""sectors of tropical crop farming--the cultivation of coffee, flowers, and sugar cane . and so the``senior partner""appears to be tightening with the one hand the vise in which the drug mafia now finds itself, while using the other hand to protect its market from legal Latin American exports . Finally, the last but, I think, most substantive argument . Actually, it also casts an unfavorable light on the role of consistent fighter against the drug mafia which Washington has now assumed . This argument is perfectly Encapsulated in just one short word:``Panama .""indeed, did the recent aggression against this sovereign state, one of whose main motives was actually``to punish the drug business bosses ,""not demonstrate all the flaws of Washington's``Strongarm approach""toward Latin America? and are there any guarantees that the Pentagon will not start``copying""its Panamanian experience in other countries in the continent on the pretext of pursuing the``cocaine barons""? these are far from Rhetorical questions, and it is a pity that Cartagena simply failed to provide even the slightest clear-cut answers to them."

Instead, it is more a wish, I believe it is a legitimate wish, of all the Salvadoran people . They want the case to be solved and, above all, they want justice .

It is said that aid to El Salvador was stopped for aid to Panama . could it not happen--with Mrs. Chamorra's victory--that readjustments are made in aid to several central American countries, including El Salvador? in this respect, the Frg government has already renewed aid to El Salvador, but not to other countries . How do you see this situation? well, this could well happen, as, obviously, the U.S. government and the Senate and House of representatives are free to give aid to whatever country they believe it is advisable to do so . Certainly there is a new situation, and many have expressed today that they are willing to help Nicaragua, as well as Panama and others . This situation could perfectly well lessen the amount of aid to El Salvador . This is a possibility . Juan Burgos of Interpress service . UN Secretary General that are interpreted as that pressure was applied to you and to the armed forces commanders by some political leaders . I can tell you very clearly, and I believe that the UN Secretary General can testify to my statements, that our position has been fitting and consistent and that we maintain the position we expressed to him at present . We did place as a Pre-Condition that the Fmln stop all terrorist actions . It is hard to understand that the United Nations, an organization that has condemned terrorism, cannot back our position, as we are trying to eliminate Fmln terrorist actions . But we have not changed our position, and it is the same one we expressed to the UN Secretary General . [moderator) Margarita Artega of Acan-Efe . Mr. President, I would like to ask you if the mobilization of peasants today could be an announcement that the state of siege is about to lifted, as, supposedly, concentrations and Mobilizations are prohibited? It depends on the security situation . The state of siege is not permanent . We must analyze the context of the threat that might exist with regard to security . We have read some reports, though we have not yet confirmed them, claiming that the Fmln has said that it does not intend to launch any more offensives . It is a good sign that the Fmln is looking for a way to a dialogue, and this could produce the lifting of the state of siege . As you know, the state of siege has been greatly reduced . It is not the same . We have been reducing it progressively and it is now strictly what is necessary for national security . Francisco Espinosa for ABC news . Well, I do not know . I believe that for a dialogue to take place, the Pre-Condition has to be met, regardless of Nicarguan election results and what it means for the Fmln . Our position is based on principles, on the principle that the people not continue to suffer the violence generated by Fmln terrorism . Thus, this is something that has to be met, regardless of the elections . Obviously, I believe the results of the Nicaraguan elections will affect the Fmln in some measures, and this could include...I do not know . We would have to see what position they will take in the future, but it could be . Obviously a change has occurred and will have an impact and could move the Fmln to change its position."
1144,DEV-MUC3-1145,SAN SALVADOR,,"And, therefore, it does not seem like it is a total advancement in a democratic process, because obviously it is not very Democratic to have the armed forces of a country under the control of one of its political parties . The Armed forces of a country should respond to the democratic process and to the government that is legitimately elected by the people . and therefore, this would curtail the freedom of choice of the Nicaraguan people in trying to control and govern the country, even though it is not from the position of being president of the country . Secondly, I think that I have mentioned before that it is not the result of the election that will change our attitude with respect to our diplomatic relations with Nicaragua, but rather the attitude of the Nicaraguan government with respect to aid to the Fmln, to the Marxist guerrillas in El Salvador . and in this case we still have not seen that change taking place . Obviously, we feel that with Mrs Chamorro as president of Nicaragua that this aid will stop and therefore make it easier for the resumption of normal relations between El Salvador and Nicaragua, but it is that attitude that would make a change and not necessarily the result in itself . with respect to the third question, obviously I think that if Mrs Chamorro really is in control, in total control, especially of the Sandinista Army, that there will be a stop in aid, and therefore the Fmln would not have Nicaragua's logistical and military support for them . and therefore, this certainly affects them . I think that about one week ago or two weeks ago in the Washington post there was a report that Colonel Benavides was living a rather luxurious life . I do not know if you have seen that piece . and also the U.S . Ambassador William Walker has said that he felt that it was time that, well, the article implies that there was some pressure, or there was some protection coming from the Tandona to protect Benavides, because he their men and that some lower lieutenants were not going to be receiving any sort of protection and they may have to take the fault for what has happened . and also William Walker had said that he felt that it was time for some of the people in the Tandona to step down and for other officers to move up . What do you think about that? should there be that kind of pressure? should some of the guys in the Tandona step down from their posts? well, I think that it is not really the determining factor whether you belong to a specific graduating class within the armed forces that should be what determines whether you continue or not, or be removed or not from the armed forces . It is your own performance and your own behavior that should be the determining factor . So, therefore, it is not necessarily that the Tandona people, just for being members of the graduating class, that action should be taken against them . So I think that in that case that is not really the point . with respect to the other case, I think it is now in the hands of the judicial system in the country on how it goes, what type of defense those that have been arraigned have . I think that they all are receiving the legal support in the case and the other . As for the dialogue with the guerrillas, before you left for Taiwan you conditioned the dialogue on a ceasing of acts of violence . to be specific, does this mean all acts of violence? and also, when do you think that this dialogue can actually take place? well, if we could try and put into one basket and call that basket with a name with respect to the actions, we are asking the Fmln to stop terrorist activities, because terrorist activity is affecting the civilian population . You just mentioned the fact about a pole that they use for electrical distribution in the country . Just last night they blew up one and there are two people hurt . Two civilians that were passing by were hurt by that explosion . so that is what has to stop . The Fmln has to stop all terrorist activity, because that is the activity that hurts the civilian population . that is not military activity . that is something geared against or to confront the armed forces . So it is that violence that can be summed up in what is called terrorism that we are asking for--those activities that really affect the civilian population of the country."

Lemos said: I can expect anything from the ELN . He added that he believed that this group makes no exceptions when it wants to kill someone . The up has blamed President Virgilio Barco's government and the military for the annihilation campaign against its members, demanding guarantees for their political activities with less than two weeks before the 11 March legislative elections take place . The up made the report following the murder on 26 February of Apartado Mayor Diana Cordoba Saldarriaga--Apartado is located 480 km to the northeast of Bogota--and the murder on the evening of 27 February of six more up followers in Unguia, a village in Choco Department . When blaming the ELN, the government minister said that these individuals want to bring anarchy and instability to the country . Lemos added that as part of the ELN's Destablization campaign, it would not be difficult to imagine that they would have the murder people of other Left-Wing sectors as their goal, and admitted that there has been a series of threats against various government officials, including himself . When referring to the up's reports holding the military responsible, he said that this was absurd and added that it is intended to lead the investigations astray and to try to stop the elections in Colombia."

The film clips we will see in a few minutes were taken this afternoon and early tonight at the Residency of the Peruvian ambassador in Bella Vista Corregimiento, El Cangrejo neighborhood, when people were staging a peaceful demonstration prompted by the Panamanian government's decision to grant Safe-Conducts to some of the Panamanians currently at the Peruvian embassy . Among the Panamanians who sought shelter at the Peruvian embassy and who were granted Safe-Conducts are Marcela Tason, former private Secretary of ousted Panamanian dictator Manuel Antonio . captains Heraclides Sucre, and Gonzalo Gonzalez, involved in the killing of major Moises Giroldi are also at the Peruvian embassy . The film clips show part of the intense protests that took place near, or rather on the grounds of the Residency of the Peruvian ambassador in Panama city . demonstrators threw stones at the embassy windows and later set fire to part of the Residency installations . During the protest not one of the Peruvian embassy officials attempted to leave the diplomatic quarters . Peruvian diplomats and even the Panamanians who sought shelter at the Peruvian embassy and who were at the Residency remained inside . Panamanian public force units Unsucessfully tried to control demonstrators . During the incident, a public force member who tried to prevent the incident was slightly injured . These scenes were filmed this afternoon and during the early evening hours by our Cameraman Jose Casis Jr. and show part of the protest actions against the Residency . major Edgardo Lopez Grimaldo, former defense forces public relations officer, and the other captains we mentioned before are currently at the Residency . Let us listen to part of the statements by the widow of major Moises Giroldi . He told us that he will take us to first vice president and justice Minister Ricardo Arias Calderon . did you agree to that? I do not want to see anyone else killed . I think there have been enough people killed . I believe the pressure we have exerted is enough . What will be your position when you talk to the Minister? I want the Panamanian government to take action so that the Peruvian authorities turn those people over to the Panamanians . I think it is a matter of firmly demanding that the Peruvian government turns this people over to Panama . However, if there is not a satisfactory response today, by the authorities and the government, what measures will you adopt? will you continue protesting? of course we will continue protesting . We will continue protesting because the only thing we are asking for is that these people surrender to Panamanian justice so the law can be enforced because they killed .... Heraclides Sucre fired at my husband, have you heard about it, he Machinegunned my husband in cold blood . other officers and soldiers who took part in the 3 October coup were tortured, cut with machetes . The following film clips show a dialogue between president of the Republic Guillermo Endara, vice president Ricardo Arias Calderon, and the widows of officers and Militarymen missing or killed on 3 October 1989 in the attempted coup . The dialogue between the President, the Vice President, and the demonstrators was positive . demonstrators promised to remain calm and wait until Panamanian justice determines the responsibility, and issue sentences for those currently at the Peruvian embassy . later on vice president Ricardo Arias Calderon, and president Endara made statements to the press . We will listen first to statements by vice president Ricardo Arias Calderon."

I had the opportunity along with the President to talk to Mrs. Giroldi, and she assured us that her only intention was to stage a peaceful protest and at no time did they plan to include any violent acts . Mrs. Giroldi said that she is very surprised that some people whom she does not know and has never seen before promoted violent acts . She told the President of the Republic that she will talk to the people and tell them that there should be no violence and that violence is not the aim . The President and I appreciate what she is doing; we understand her pain . We explained to her that the President has not authorized any Safe-Conducts for individuals who have been charged with murder . those cases are being treated differently by the President and the Minister of foreign relations . is a break in relations expected between Panama and Peru due to the violent actions? not at all . I talked to the Peruvian charge D'Affaires after our foreign minister talked to him . He knows that the National government profoundly regrets what has transpired; that the people who were protesting there, such as Mrs Giroldi, had no plans to carry out violent actions . unidentified people, whose identity we will try to determine, urged the throwing of fire bombs against the embassy . The foreign minister and myself expressed our apologies to the Peruvian government for any inconveniences or insecurity felt by its personnel . These are very Regretful incidents . not only a basic courtesy of civilized people, that is to respect the residences of other people, and more so when they belong to representatives of other countries, but a principle of international law has been violated . that principle is due respect for diplomatic missions . What really worries us about this incident is a report given to us by the organizers of demonstrations at the embassy . specifically, by the widows of men murdered by those who are Refuged in that Embassy; the widow of major Giroldi was here, and she told us that all her actions at the embassy have been peaceful . She told us that today they noticed that totally unfamiliar people were present and these people provoked the violence; they Instigated the violence . Obviously, there certain groups are seeking to spoil our efforts to achieve democracy . They want to prevent the establishment of a democratic system with justice and liberty at all costs . I believe that this incident must be denounced before the Attorney General of the nation . He should investigate these Provocations . Nevertheless, the executive branch urges the citizens to not allow people to provoke them into participating in violent actions such as one which occurred today . The citizens must not allow others to exploit the feelings that all Panamnians feel towards criminals and people who have committed crimes and who are holed up in embassies such as this one; we urge citizens to avoid being provoked."

The Armed Forces press committee reported that the clashes took place near San Isidro Labrador, where three guerrillas were killed and five others were wounded . The Farabundo Marti National liberation front, which has been fighting the U.S.-backed Army for the last 10 years, has traditionally maintained a high profile in strategic areas of Chalatenango . Meanwhile, urban guerrilla Commandos harassed troops belonging to the 1ST infantry Brigade last night at the Mariona Penitentiary, located on the northern outskirts of San Salvador, apparently leaving no casualties . Atlacatl Battalion troops, which maintain a Counterinsurgency operation at the foothills of Guazapa Hill, to the North of San Salvador, confiscated war materiel that the guerrillas had hidden underground . In another turn of events, Fmln Sappers who continuously sabotage the electrical power system destroyed several high-voltage posts in La Libertad and cabanas departments in the central part of the country, and in Usulutan Department in the southeastern part of the country . There were widespread power outages in the three departments while technicians of the state-run electric power companies repaired the damage .

1153,DEV-MUC3-1154,GUATEMALA CITY,1990-03-06,"Now, just like 13 years ago when a Democratic administration was installed in the White House, the relations between Guatemala and the United States are particularly tense, and today, just like then, the reason for the tension in their bilateral relations is the human rights situation, because, according to the Republican administration of George Bush, the Christian Democratic government of Vinicio Cerezo does not seem to have enough political will to neutralize the problems that are affecting the security of citizens and individual guarantees . in March 1977, newly installed U.S. President Jimmy Carter demanded that the regime headed by General Kjell Laugerud rectify a domestic policy that, according to the White House, was characterized by repressive practices against the opposition and peasant and labor groups . The Guatemalan authorities reacted by rejecting U.S. military aid . the same position was adopted, amid very similar circumstances, by the military governments of Jorge Videla in Argentina and Augusto Pinochet in Chile . relations between Guatemala and Washington continued to be tortuous during the balance of the Carter administration and only improved, relatively speaking, when Republican Ronald Reagan took office in 1981 . However, only years later--with the commitment to democratization by de facto military governments that led the country from 1982 and 1985--was there a conciliatory attitude between Guatemala and the United States that brought about quite harmonious relations between the governments of President Cerezo and Presidents Reagan and Bush until Mid-1989 . On 27 February U.S . Ambassador Thomas Strook criticized the Guatemalan authorities' failure to pursue the authors of murders and of kidnappings of political, student, and labor leaders, and thus worsened an atmosphere of confrontation that had resurfaced about six months ago when Ambassador Strook, who had just arrived in Guatemala, objected to the appointment of Colonel Hugo Moran Carranza, former director of administrative control, to the post of manager of the Santo Tomas de Castilla port enterprise . The Ambassador justified his objection by claiming that aspects related to international drug trafficking had to be resolved first . On 6 March, president Cerezo said that the United States had hardened its attitude toward the Guatemalan regime and that this attitude contrasts with a tolerant posture exhibited toward previous administrations in Guatemala: they have harshly criticized the courts situation . The Supreme Court of justice and as a result of the UN action a draft procedural law will be submitted . This should be approved and proceedings should improve in Guatemala in about years . However, we are dealing with long-term effort . We have made institutional changes for only four years . I sincerely believe that the U.S . attitude toward a country that is making efforts to move forward is unfair and overly critical . It is being more critical of the current Guatemalan government than it ever was toward past Dictatorships . The United States has been considerably harsher in criticizing the current Guatemalan government democracy than past dictatorial governments, to which the United States, in certain cases, was an accomplice by saying nothing . only hours after the President made these statements, the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala issued a communique stating that if the United States Abstained from voicing its concern over human rights abuses, it would indeed be acting as an accomplice . The communique cites statements made on 5 March in Washington by State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiller that U.S . Ambassador Strook, in his capacity as President Bush's personal representative, has on many occasions told top Guatemalan officials, in public and private, that those who commit violent acts must be turned over to justice . Strook is currently in Washington where he was recalled by the State Department for consultations . According to the diplomatic mission, the ambassador's statements accurately reflect the permanent U.S . position of considering human rights as an issue that must be treated at an international level."

The Fpmr was also in the news with the unsuccessful 7 September 1986 attack on Chile's chief executive, General Augusto Pinochet, which claimed the lives of five of Pinochet's Bodyguards .

In Aylwin's opinion, the group of eight--which is made up of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Panama--emerged primarily to support democratic movements in some Latin American countries . Now that democracy has spread to virtually all Latin American countries, the group of eight could become``the seed for a broader organization, because the reasons that prevented other countries from joining have gradually disappeared .

As of last December, de Soto has been meeting with both parties, the church, and Salvadoran political sectors . The Cristiani statement terms as``false""the charges raised by the Fmln to the effect that the government is responsible for hindering the resumption of the peace efforts .``President Cristiani has reiterated to Mr. de Soto a true willingness to seek through a serious dialogue and not a tactical or much less propagandistic dialogue the solution to the armed conflict ,""the document points out .

Escobar was acting as the cartel's intermediary in charge of contacting lawyer Guido parra, the liaison between the cartel and high level government officials . Escobar did not disclose the names of the officials involved . a national police intelligence report says that Ochoa and Escobar find themselves in a precarious situation because other Trafficker groups have withdrawn their support as they do not want to be held accountable for kidnappings and other terrorist acts they have not perpetrated . The report further indicates that Escobar, pressured by military operations in Antioquia,``was forced to order the kidnappings of Alvaro Diego Montoya, and Patricia Echevarria and her daughter .""these high profile hostages served as a``protective shield ,""according to the article . spokesmen for the intelligence Corps are quoted as saying that Escobar knew that by taking hostage the son of the Secretary General of the Presidency, he could successfully exert the pressure he needed to act in the name of the``Extraditables .""problems began to surface soon after the cartel's surrender, as members at odds with Escobar started to break away from the group . According to Medellin officials, the kidnappings of Montoya and Echevarria also had an impact on the rate of attrition among the``Extraditables .

The Fmln urges the government of Rafael Callejas and the Honduran armed forces' high command to order the end to these Incursions into El Salvador that are affecting humble civilians . at a time when the peoples of the world are clamoring for peace through dialogue and understanding among nations, the Honduran government must prevent further confrontations at other border areas, especially now that Honduras is burdened by a serious economic crisis and requires .

He scored a sweeping victory during December's general elections with the support of all the opposition parties, including Communists . The restoration of democracy in Chile will by no means be easy . bomb explosions shook the capital on the eve of the Inauguration ceremony as Militants reminded the public of their presence . According to Aylwin, it is important for the government to overcome the deep political division of Chilean society .``only this ,""Aylwin believes,``will allow Chile to do away with vestiges of the totalitarian system and eventually expand Parliament's powers, to amend the Constitution and the unfair electoral system and to Legalise banned parties . Analysts believe the revival of Chile, which has Long-Standing Democratic traditions, will be held back by the fact that, according to the Constitution in force, Pinochet will remain Commander-In- chief of the ground forces for eight more years . This substantially curtails the President's rights as Supreme commander of the country's armed forces . Furthermore, before stepping down, the former ruler has ensured himself an obedient majority in the Senate, the Chilean Parliament's upper Chamber . in the International arena the new government will have to overcome the isolation that resulted from the years of dictatorship, when human rights were grossly violated and thousands of freedom fighters were ruthlessly persecuted or eliminated . This task is facilitated by the fact that relaxation processes are gaining momentum in the world and East-West cooperation is on the upswing . numerous foreign guests, including a Soviet delegation, arrived for the Inauguration ceremony and the transfer of power to a civilian government . an agreement is expected to be signed these days on the restoration of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Chile and on the opening of their respective embassies in Moscow and Santiago."

According to the people who gave this report, the criminals are well-armed and apparently, willing to fight to the end to maintain the criminal ring, left to them by former dictator Manuel Antonio Noreiga .``they have weapons similar to the ones used by the murdering dignity battalions' in their practices and they have received many late night visits; some neighbors say they also sell drugs ,""said a Veracruz resident who did not want to be identified for fear of retaliation by the Colombian criminals . The charges presented by Veracruz residents may result in another police operation that will, once and for all, eliminate all the bands of armed assailants and drug traffickers who were armed in the past by Manuel Antonio Noreiga dictatorship . The most dangerous aspect of this situation is the rumors in the Corregimiento that many COLOMBIANS, who escaped from the recent police operation in Curundu, have hidden in Veracruz and this clearly indicates that there is a fearless army of criminals made up of Panamanians and Undocumented COLOMBIANS."

We do not exactly know how many people were killed . You do not know? we do not know . are you going to let them leave? are you going to let them escape to Peru? look, as a lawyer I know what Latin American International treaties say--those that have only been signed and ratified by the Latin American countries because the United States has not ratified them--regarding the right to Asylum . The host country decides what crime has been committed, not the home country . There are rights established in those treaties . The home country may inquire about the charges that have been filed against the people who have sought refuge . The home country may ask the host country not to determine what crimes have been committed in each case . If the host country has already decided on the charges, it may be asked by the home country to reconsider its decision and to provide evidence supporting those charges . We are currently exercising those rights . We hope Peru does not insist because our relations, as you have already seen they are not accepting other cases, which are less serious . for example, we have the case of a man like Toty Suarez; we have the case of General Noriega's wife and daughters; and a number of other cases where we cannot call these people Assasins . We did not have any evidence against them . What about Manuel Solis Palma? Solis Palma left the embassy and nothing happened to him . his case was interesting . He sought Asylum and the Venezuelan Embassy never, never, officially informed the Panamanian government that Solis Palma was there . He was there as a guest? yes . When we were asked about the fate of Solis Palma, we replied that, for all we knew, he was spending a few days with the Venezuelan Ambassador . He had every right to sleep there . I will ask a few more questions . You may ask anything you like . There were many people saying that the invasion was a U.S. pretext not to return the canal in the year 2000 . No, no . There has never even been the slightest hint from any U.S. government official, not from the State Department or the Army about this . Congressmen of all ideologies have been here, even from the extreme right--I do not think there are any extreme leftist Congressmen in the United States--as well as senators . military officers have also been here . I have had long talks with them . They have not even hinted that they want to change the treaties or that they want to stay beyond the year 2000 . all of that is Noriega's nonsense . Noriega was the one who started that campaign . There has never been any talk about this, not even about the bases remaining beyond the year 2000 . There has been none of that at all."

However, we view as a negative that in the government's response there is not a corresponding attitude . In this regard, we inform : 1 . The government response tries to undermine our gesture . The Fmln has never had a policy to attack or harm the civilian population . Our gestures are a clear contribution to strengthening the space of other political and social forces to allow for their participation in the political negotiation solution process and in the effort to humanize the conflict . 2 . The government and the armed forces continue to violate human rights, bomb civilian populated areas, subject the country to a permanent state of siege, be it legal or de facto . in a constant and systematic manner, the government maintains a policy of capturing and torturing leaders of people's groups; maintains Sieges and raids; Harasses the communities of Repatriates; and Sabotages the property of residents in areas under the Fmln control . in the meantime, no step has been taken to investigate and punish the murder of Monsignor Romero and the massacre of Fenastras, while the trial against the murderers of the Jesuit priests has stagnated and the suspects are promoted or sent abroad . The government intends to appoint as defense Minister the person who gave the order to murder the priests, and it allows the reported executioner to live in a luxury apartment . 3 . We agree with the permanent, serious, important, and reserved character that the negotiation process should have . 4 . The government is morally and politically compelled to implement as soon as possible goodwill gestures that will permit the exercise of citizen's freedoms and cease the daily human rights violations and all forms of aggression aimed at the civilian population . 5 . We warn that it would be regrettable for the people's peace and democracy hopes that the government and the armed forces try to harden Warmongering positions, believing in the Mirage of an alleged weakness of the Fmln .

We demonstrated that the Farc is involved in drug trafficking . As you saw, the seizure of 35 packages of marijuana and of a cocaine processing laboratory in Caloto, in this same operation, shows us that we are facing a subversive group that is also involved in the marijuana business activity .

1170,DEV-MUC3-1171,MANAGUA ,1990-03-16,"In September 1970, I was in jail with other comrades . Our Jailers did not allow us to read the newspapers--not even the ones published by the Somozas--but we found ways to get a radio and were able to learn of Salvador Allende's election through the people's vote . We were jail in 1973 when we learned of the brutal coup against the people's will and democracy . radio reports said that planes were bombing La Moneda and we pictured President Allende heroically resisting there . We did not lose our morale . We became indignant and full of courage . We thought and felt certain that the Chilean people would go on winning because it was their will to be free and sovereign . so many years had to pass for us to be here with the Chilean people . After that came the victory of the revolution in Nicaragua . that day , 19 July 1979, when the victorious people entered Managua, Salvador Allende was there struggling side by side with the Nicaraguan people . I want to outline some views, but with the understanding that the current international political picture is extremely complex . First of all, we respect political and ideological options . When we won, we Sandinists thought that the time had come to develop a different system to give Nicaragua what had been denied to it by the imperialist domination . Sandino epitomized the Nicaraguan people's Anti-Imperialist struggle, the first manifestations of which occurred last century . Sandino advocated not only a struggle against North American intervention, but social and economic change . He did not put a label on his thoughts, but was convinced that to be a Nicaraguan and Latin American, one had to be Anti-Imperialist and had to advocate social and economic transformations in favor of the people . The Sandinist front picked up Sandino's banners and adopted his still unfinished historical program . So, after victory, we thought that we had to think of a different program for Nicaragua . We rejected dogmas or schemes with regard to the method of struggle to achieve victory or the model that would be viable for Nicaragua in the Latin American context . We began with three basic tenets: a multiparty system, a mixed economy, and social and economic justice . exercising this right, we said: This is the path . and the United States said: that is not the path . tightly clinging to its imperialistic policy, the United States decided to destroy the Nicaraguan revolution and organized a military, political, and economic onslaught . You are familiar with this story and its tragic toll of 60,000 victims . We have been able to defend Nicaragua and the gains attained by the Revolution, because this defense was headed by the Nicaraguan people who, armed with their conscience and courage, took up weapons to defend their homeland's sovereignty and territorial integrity."

The humble people, the peasants, and the workers can rest assured that the Army will safeguard the Fatherland's sovereignty, it will not turn the Cannons against the workers . I never said that the Fsln would perpetually remain in the government, but that the people would perpetuate themselves in power . that I did say! others will say that the Sandinists made many concessions, but if we held elections, it was because we were convinced that we could lose, a new model in Latin America that not only guarantees the existence of democracy, but its development and deepening . It is Democratic to constantly question democracy to refresh, strengthen, and deepen democracy . The cleanest and most observed electoral process is the one that was carried out in Nicaragua . We have nothing to hide . The reporters said that if we won they would leave, but since we lost they have stayed on to see if we will surrender power on 25 April . Although it is true that the Fsln suffered an upset in the elections, as a political force that has been the vanguard of the process that led the country to democracy, independence, dignity, and sovereignty, the Fsln is now consolidating the results of democracy . It is not true that the revolution has been defeated, because it has emerged from the elections stronger . I am preparing to act as the opposition alongside the people when I am no longer President on 25 April . I am a deputy, but I prefer to be in the neighborhoods, the factories, and the countryside . I have told the Nicaraguans that we must consolidate this process, which means the consolidation of democracy in Nicaragua . We must be more creative and imaginative than ever, because we will face new challenges that will be enriching to us as a revolution . to be a clandestine opposition is not the same as to rule from above . We will now govern from below, and we will defend popular and national interests . The return of Somozism is not sought . The electoral victory does not mean a return of the Counterrevolution, that continues to threaten Nicaragua . If the Counterrevolution is not disarmed, the new government will also have to confront the Counterrevolution, and we will fight as we never did before . The United States lifted the embargo and offered aid to Nicaragua . We will not be like right-wing extremists who sabotage economic efforts . resources have not been offered to a certain party, but to all of the people . Nicaragua not only deserves international cooperation, it should be Indemnified by the U.S. government . We have felt the solidarity of people the world over, we have felt the solidarity of the American people, who have also been murdered by the Counterrevolution in our Fatherland . I have heard of emotional examples of solidarity, such as Bryan Wilson's, who sat in front of a train that ran over him, and who tells me he feels proud to be one of the thousands of Amputees from the war in Nicaragua . The blood of Chileans, Americans, and Europeans was shed in Nicaragua . I must thank this heroic and exemplary Chile for the manner in which it has displayed its fondness for the Nicaraguan people through me, and I must tell you that today, more than ever, the solidarity of people who defend the cause of freedom, sovereignty, democracy, and independence is indispensable . the future, it is said, belongs to the people, because the present and the past also belong to them . The revolution should be refreshed, it should be watered with fresh rain; only then will the trees turn green and the flowers bloom, only then will the revolutionary processes be understood . We could talk for hours and hours, but this is not the time to talk . It is the time to act . This visit to Chile will be unforgettable for me because of the happiness, optimism, and confidence reflected in the faces and in the eyes of the Chilean people . This night will be unforgettable for me . Therefore, I wish to pay homage to those who were examples of Latin American dignity and are with us always in Chile, Nicaragua, and Latin America: Salvador Allende and Pablo Neruda . long live Nicaragua!"

He also said that whatever happened from then on would also be blamed on your statement, and that the best service you could give the country would be to resign . I already replied to a question about my resignation . I cannot resign because I am not guilty . by resigning I would be admitting my guilt to something I had nothing to do with . However, I am glad that you mentioned that this has been occurring for the past 4 years . I was a journalist four years ago . made a mistake a few days ago by again linking the up with the Farc? I prefer not to discuss this topic now . I do not think that this is the best time to discuss that subject . After this situation has settled, I will have to file a formal statement at the Attorney General's office where I have been summoned by the up . as a government official, I am obliged to appear before the Attorney General's office to explain my actions, but now is not the moment to explain anything . of course, the President is very distressed, as we all are . We believe this is a terrible; there is no justification for something like this to happen . It is evident that people who are seeking a goal opposite to that of the government are involved in this . The government wants a free electoral process; it is committed to that . today, when we have a completely orderly electoral process, it would be absurd, illogical, irrational, and senseless for the government to promote actions that run counter to its goal of ensuring that its term ends in peace and that the elections will take place normally . The up has again cast doubt over the government's guarantees for the candidates and the party . I believe that the government has done everything humanly possible to guarantee the safety of candidates, not only the safety of up members, but of all Presidential candidates, regardless of their affiliation . in their communique, evidence of the fact that Dr Jaramillo's Bodyguards reacted and, I understand, by killing one of the assassins, at least that is what I have heard, and arrested another one, which has been confirmed, shows that the government is indeed offering protection . Therefore, Dr. Jaramillo was indeed enjoying government protection just as the other Presidential candidates are . What happens is that the assassins carry out surprise attacks . at a given moment, an approaching person can can pull out a weapon and kill Whomever he wants . There is no 100-Percent prevention against this . This holds true not only in Colombia but in many countries in the world . The very course of these terrible events of this morning at the Aiport show that Dr Jaramillo was indeed protected . The up has just announced that it will file suit against you for this assassination . that is fine . If the up has any evidence that I am involved in Dr. Jaramillo's assassination, then it must file suit, because otherwise, it would be acting as an accomplice to this assassination . I believe that suits must be filed by those who suspect that a government official, and myself particularly, may be involved in the assassination, to ensure that the incident is investigated . Therefore, I believe that this is good news amid a sea of bad news that we have heard today . only responsibility for physical safety, but there is also political responsibility . You are being accused of political irresponsibility and of not Responsibile for physical safety."

The Salvadoran Air Force played a key role during the last guerrilla military offensive in November 1989, and it was accused by opposition groups, humanitarian organizations, and the Catholic Church of Indiscriminately bombing poor neighborhoods of the capital to dislodge reported guerrilla Redoubts .

1181,DEV-MUC3-1182,BOGOTA,,"Amid all the confusion and alarm that today prevails throughout the country, what would Dr. Lloreda do to restore public tranquility? What is the immediate and most urgent thing to do? Juan, I believe that security is no longer an academic issue; it has become an anguished need for Colombia . This will probably mean that we will have to make many sacrifices if we want to put a stop to violence within a few years . In fact, we will have to sacrifice some of the broad and generous freedom we have always enjoyed in this country . given these deplorable actions, the security issue has become a priority, because one cannot live in a society in which its members are continuously threatened . This not only refers to Dr. Jaramillo Ossa's death, but also to other deaths that sometimes do not appear where they should, meaning the front page of the newspapers . a week or two ago the police said that we have had an average of 54 violent deaths per day so far this year . If this continues, we will have more than 12,000 murders in Colombia by the time President Barco turns over power on 7 August . I believe, and I think you share the same viewpoint, that we have a world record for insecurity and violence . Therefore, we cannot take the risk of allowing the process of moral collapse and the state of insecurity that prevails in the country to continue . We must strengthen the state so that it can successfully counter violence . The Plebiscite and the constituent assembly I have been proposing includes the need for the state to have efficient instruments to counter violent actions . This is not, like I said in the beginning, an academic issue; and it is not a proposal presented by idealistic youths . It is the expression of a nation that could disappear or lose its freedoms and democracy, if we do not act decisively and resolutely . This is not a problem between political parties . yesterday I presented my government platform and I issued a proposal to Dr. Gaviria--regardless of the 27 may electoral results, we must reach a patriotic agreement . We can now do it in homage to Bernardo Jaramillo so that the idea of a Plebiscite is sponsored . Thus, we will be able to make a thorough institutional reorganization . We must sit down and think about Colombia, rather than electoral leaders and organizations . This is the only way we can offer solutions to future generations, because the Colombian people are now looking to their future with uncertainty and fear . Thank you, Dr. Lloreda, you are very kind .

Gn commander general Manuel Ibedaca Romero agreed to talk about the topic during a recent interview with El Nacional . General, much has been said about Venezuela's alleged Vulnerabilty to the International drug trafficking cartels . is this true? is there a danger that Venezuela could become an operational base for the cocaine mafia? is it true that heavy investments have been detected near the border and other areas of the country, with money of which no one knows the source? What is being done to control this flow of capital? I share this concern . It is very simple: when you are in a building or a house and there are problems in your neighbor's house, this of course directly affects you because of the unrest, because there might be an uncomfortable situation where for example, you might have to testify . Ibedaca thus begins his explanations with a simple, Easy-To-Understand domestic analogy . He admits that Venezuela``is in a situation that should really catch our attention, because Venezuela borders Colombia and we know that Coca is produced mainly in Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and is processed in Colombia . Colombia is America's great cocaine laboratory . drug traffickers have recently suffered hard setbacks through recent actions by the Colombian Army and national police in which the heads of these organizations have been killed and great amounts of money and cocaine and a number of airplanes have been seized . to transport what is left, they will, of course, have to look for a better place and this is where we have several Vulnerabilities .""like what? the extensive border, the Plains near it with clandestine landing strips; the proximity to Easy-To-Use ports and airports . through the antidrug trafficking services and together with the Disip and the metropolitan police, we have a plan and we have taken definite actions to fight it . aware of this, we have established a system of investment controls in these States near Colombia . We are receiving reports of property registrations, but we need to take more effective measures, because we need greater control and supervision in this area, especially commercial operations . in 1986, three years after the drug law went into effect, the Gn's antidrug division made a record Confiscation of 29,698 kilos of marijuana, a figure that dropped significantly in 1988, and increased in 1989 . Since it was founded by General German Sepulveda Sierra, this office has been in charge of coordinating and planning actions that the Gn develops against drug trafficking, even though it is limited by the drug law as an adjunct to the tribunals . In other words, the files must be turned over to the judicial technical police . It is currently called the directorate of the services against drug trafficking and is directed by brigadier general Ramon Guillen Davila, who also agreed to talk to El Nacional . The fight against drugs has been a job of the Gn during all of its existence . I have been in it since I was a Sublieutenant . Now it is called the``modern crime""and one of the most difficult wars to fight . precisely because of that war, the big Colombian traffickers have proposed to their country's government formulas to achieve peace and retire from the drug business . are these proposals from the drug cartels sincere? we asked the general . I think that it is only a strategy to gain time and seek their own solutions . It is not strange that they are pretending to turn Venezuela into an``operational base .""there is democracy and liberty of movement and investment here . In just San Antonio del Tachira, there are 76 exchange houses and only one meets the requirements of the law . When we have pressured the Peracal tax Registry, we got complaints from a lot of people . The Venezuelan air and highway system is very favorable to them . neighboring countries connect with Europe through Venezuela . a lot of merchandise goes through in transit, and when they seize a shipment, what they say is that the airplane``came from Venezuela .

Yesterday Ayacucho was left in darkness after a shining path attack . at least three people were killed, several were wounded, and various arrests were made by the police . yesterday was the most violent day in Ayacucho since last November when municipal elections were held . The elections were then Annulled because of the high number of null and blank votes . last week in Huancayo , 415 km southeast of Lima, an Apra candidate for deputy was murdered . Yesterday an individual was wounded when a car bomb exploded causing extensive material damage . yesterday in Chiclayo, in northern Peru, a bomb was thrown at the House of Fredemo candidate for deputy Miguel Angel Bartra, who was not in the house at the time . In La Libertad Department a terrorist group took over the Guadalupito town early yesterday morning in an effort to find the local Apra Secretary General and the town's Mayor . When the terrorists could not find them, they blew up the offices of the municipality and the power station causing an outage in the zone . The strikes affecting 100,000 workers in the country continue and the strikers have rejected the``labor truce""until the elections are over that had been requested by interior Minister Agustin Mantilla . Mantilla said that the strikes``are bordering on the seditious and the criminal .""in the last 10 years political violence in Peru has caused 19,000 deaths, of which 700 have occurred so far this year."

1196,DEV-MUC3-1197,BOGOTA,1990-03-29,"The reformist sector of the leftist patriotic Union today resigned from the party's National coordinating board, creating an unprecedented crisis in its five years of political life . During the second day of its plenum, twelve of its 20 members, including up President Diego Montana Cuellar, resigned from the National coordinating board, which also includes activists of the Communist party of Colombia . According to sources close to the up, the reformist faction resigned from the coordinating board because it believes that what is needed in Colombia is a broad social Democratic movement, such as that advocated by up presidential candidate Bernardo Jaramillo Ossa, who was assassinated on 22 March . The leftist sources consulted by Efe indicated today that the possibility of participating in the 27 may Presidential elections, at least with a joint up and PCC candidate, is growing more distant . While the up's reformist faction rejects the armed path as a means to achieve power, the sector known as the radicals, in other words, the eight members who did not resign from the coordinating board, agree on using different forms of struggle, including guerrilla struggle . The eight members who did not resign belong to the PCC . In addition to Montana, leaders Angelino Garzon, Guillermo Banguero, Alberto Rojas Puyo, Julio Santana, and Luis Emiro Valencia were among those who resigned . at the same time , 12 members of the national committee, another section of the party, also resigned . They are also from the reformist faction . The friction with the Reformists or Perestroyka supporters began on 28 March, the first day of sessions of the plenum, when Angelino Garzon charged that the PCC had intercepted Jaramillo Ossa's letters . Another reason for the division within the Colombian left was the not very favorable results in the 11 March legislative and municipal elections, when the up and the PCC lost several seats in the Colombian Congress . up to 22 March, the day when Jaramillo was assassinated, he was the single presidential candidate of the up and the PCC, but after his death, both parties agreed to hold a plenum to decide whether they will participate in the elections."
1197,DEV-MUC3-1198,MOSCOW ,1990-03-27,"Obvious progress has been made in solving the regional conflict in Central America . Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez will Mediate a meeting in Caracas between Salvadoran rebels and a government delegation . confidential negotiations between Guatemalan guerrillas and representatives of the National reconciliation Commission will also be held in the Norwegian capital, Oslo . listen what our commentator Leonid Levcheko has to say: these two meetings have one point in common: both have been made possible thanks to the initiative and the mediation of the most diverse circles, which are interested in putting out the fire in Central America . The Caracas meeting coincides with the start today of the official visit by Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani . Venezuelan chief of state Carlos Andres Perez, who welcomed Cristiani, has already held talks with the Salvadoran rebels delegation . The Venezuelan chief of state will act as mediator in the dialogue between the Salvadoran government and the rebels when they sit at the negotiating table . The Oslo meeting was conceived at the initiative of the Lutheran and Catholic churches . This is a big advance if one considers that the first and last direct negotiations between the Guatemalan government and the guerrillas took place in October 1987 in Spain . They were then suspended and never resumed . But it has not been easy to advance toward national reconciliation in all the countries involved in the central American conflict . before the Esquipulas agreement was signed in 1967 by the central American Presidents, many international forces, which hindered a solution, were involved in the central American conflict . The military Chiefs of El Salvador and Guatemala also rejected the negotiation process, assuming that they could defeat the Rebel movement . In fact, during 10 years of civil war more than 70,000 people have been killed in El Salvador and in nearly 30 years of conflict in Guatemala more than 100,000 have been killed . It is obvious that the Fratricidal war is absurd both in El Salvador and in Guatemala . It is time that, following the example of Nicaragua, other countries contribute to restore peace in the area . This is why the reports coming from Caracas and Oslo have been greeted with great interest . It is clear that a just solution is possible in Central America if only the principles of international law are strictly followed and the countries' sovereignty is respected by not meddling in the internal affairs of other states . This is the essence of the Soviet view on Central America."

The Armed Forces press committee confirmed that the terrorist attack occurred at 0615 on Monday in Santa Tecla , 12 km from the capital . The official report reveals that a company of policemen from the technical police instruction center, an agency of the national police, was exercising near the precinct when a powerful explosive charge in a pick-up truck went off as the policeman went by . A Coprefa spokesman has suggested that the vehicle was probably activated by remote control by a guerrilla unit."
1201,DEV-MUC3-1202,CLANDESTINE,1990-04-02,"Presidents Daniel Ortega Saavedra, Oscar Arias Sanchez, Rafael Leonardo Callejas, Marco Vinicio Cerezo Arevelo, Alfredo Cristiani: in El Salvador a serious Dialogue-Negotiation process has begun thanks to the mediation of the United Nations through its Secretary General Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar . This implies that any peace formula must take into account this negotiation process to ensure that it is based on our particular reality and the guarantees offered by this international organization . We believe that the negotiation's main objective should be the country's democratization, because while peaceful Central American and world developments are marked by a consolidation of democracy, El Salvador is quite far from experiencing this . The Army holds society's real power . This prevents justice being applied in the horrendous assassinations of Monsignor Romero, Jesuit priests, Fenastras members, and Dr. Hector Oqueli . Under such conditions, impunity continues to be institutionalized and it is not possible to enforce respect for human rights . daily life is marked by repression against the popular movement an frequent murders, while arena applies pressures and forces, by various means, the restriction of information to the media by limiting freedom of speech . It is therefore evident that El Salvador is the country that has failed to comply with the main goals of Esquipulas II--the achievement of national reconciliation, democratization, and a negotiated political solution . This situation, which is accompanied by a permanent state of siege is worsened by great restrictions on the political system that prevent the development of civilian society . It Suffices to mention the case of the electoral system: in Nicaragua, a country with half of our country's population, the Supreme electoral Council registered 1.9 million citizens in only four Sundays; in El Salvador, in eight years, the electoral Registry registered 1.6 million citizens for the recent elections and only 1 million actually voted."
1202,DEV-MUC3-1203,CLANDESTINE,1990-04-02,"In contrast, El Salvador, which has the second largest population in Central America, has the smallest Parliament with only 60 deputies . the social conflict is worsened by a war that no one has won . the time has come to let civilian society win . to achieve that we require :--the purging, restructuring, and reduction of the Army and movement toward a civilian society, an absolutely Demilitarized society .--the end of impunity through the trial and punishment of the Masterminds and Perpetrators of the assassination of Msgr Romero, Fenastras members, Jesuit priests, and Dr. Oqueli . These trials are the foundation that will ensure that reform of the judicial system is credible .--guarantees of the framework of democratic liberties .--via a Plesbicite in the 1991 elections, that the next assembly implement amendments to the Constitution, such as the expansion of the legislative assembly and the creation of a constitutional framework for the Demilitarization of society .--reform of the electoral sytem to register, by May this year at the latest, nearly 3 million eligible Salvadoran voters to allow them to participate in the 1991 elections .--the carrying out of the upcoming elections without a military presence and with the participation of international observers at least six months before and until the installation of the new assembly . The Fmln is willing to reach accords on all these issues and to implement simultaneous steps from a De-Intensification of the war and an end of hostilities to accords to end the armed conflict and the reincorporation of our forces into political life in keeping with and parallel to the aforementioned measures taking place . We express our willingness to fully support a national Registratio drive to give all eligible Salvadoran voters the opportunity to vote and contribute toward ensuring that the upcoming elections, as was the case in Nicaragua, will help establish the bases for lasting peace . Presidents: the Fmln's objectives are democratization, respect for human rights, establishment of a genuine legal state, Demilitarization, and establishment of a national economic policy as the only means to ensure that our people will peacefully move up to better levels of well-being and development . In this regard, we believe that your best contribution would be to help promote democratization in El Salvador and to advocate a negotiations process that is begun at the United Nations .

1203,DEV-MUC3-1204,BOGOTA,1990-03-31,"Kidnapping is one of Colombia's most profitable industries to the extent that, according to police statistics, four people have been kidnapped every day so far in 1990, a figure double that of the same period in 1989 . The judicial police and investigations directorate this week reported that 326 people have been kidnapped for extortion purposes so far this year . Dijin said that the number of kidnappings in this period doubled the number of kidnappings during the same period in 1989 . According to the administrative Department of security, in 1989, cattlemen paid 2 billion pesos to kidnappers and Blackmailers who threatened capturing or Assassinating them if they failed to pay . According to Das, guerrillas or criminals stole 10,000 head of cattle in 1989 and have stolen 1,500 of the animals so far in 1990 . sources consulted by Efe, both police sources and those who study the Colombian reality, have pointed out that guerrillas participate in 20 to 30 percent of the kidnapping business and common criminals in 70 to 80 percent . These percentages of participation in the industry of kidnapping are only estimates nearly impossible to check because in many cases guerrillas Kidnap people to finance their activities and do not claim responsibility for it . In addition, many people are kidnapped by common criminals, but the crime is reported as being perpetrated by guerrillas in an attempt to cover up the Malefactor's actions . According to the Das, Cordoba, in the country's northeast, is the Department most affected by this kind of crime . Other hard hit departments are Antioquia in the Northwest, Santander in the northeast, and Cauca in the Southwest . According to the Das report, the situation has become so untenable that its seems impossible to restore social balance in Cordoba on a Mid-Term basis because the population has accustomed itself to Coexisting with these irregularities or Repulsing them with mechanisms other than those stipulated by law . mechanisms other than those stipulated by law referred to by the Das are usually cattlemen organizing themselves into self-defense paramilitary groups or death squads . These paramilitary groups defend their properties or Mount raids against peasants considered accomplices or informants of leftist guerrillas or common criminals who blackmail them . According to the Das, one of the causes of this situation is social disruption and the precarious economic situation of the communities located in municipalities and localities that lack the most basic services, a reality that is most glaring in Cordoba . five guerrilla groups are active in Colombia . The most belligerent and the one that has used kidnapping to the fullest extent is the pro-Castro National liberation Army . The other groups are the Communist revolutionary armed forces of Colombia, the Maoist people's liberation Army, the Indigenist Quintin lame, and the Trotskyist revolutionary workers' party."

According to vice president Carpio the International situation today in no way justifies terrorist actions or armed movements ....this is good progress and in this connection to recognize that our countries have changed . It is not the Guatemala of five or six years ago, when there were autocratic and military regimes . Today we are in a process of democratization and in this connection we all ought to involve ourselves in it . Therefore, I think, this is the begining of something which could end the armed struggle in Guatemala, as it should also end throughout all Central America."

1206,DEV-MUC3-1207,SAN SALVADOR,1990-04-03,"What is the position of the armed forces concerning the Presidential summit in Nicaragua and the upcoming dialogue to be held in Geneva between the rebels and the government? will the armed forces seek support for the dialogue and a solution to the conflict? last week the armed forces released a public message to the people explaining their stand and mentioning three basic points: first, the armed forces support a dialogue that seeks peace in the country through mechanisms of understanding and agreement . Second, the armed forces express their loyalty to the President of the Republic in these efforts and other efforts he may undertake to find the peace we all cherish in this country . Third, we possess the moral conviction and the obedience--as ordered by the Constitution--as well as the humanistic awareness to promote and protect the human rights of all Salvadorans . those are the basic points included in our message to the Salvadoran people that we announced last week . As for the Presidential summit being held in Nicaragua, the armed forces wholeheartedly support the efforts undertaken by our government to find the mechanisms that will lead us to peace in the region . that is why the President of the Republic has our full support in this endeavour for finding peace and democracy throughout Central America . concerning the dialogue in Geneva, I believe that tomorrow there will be a briefing with the participation of delegates from the government and the Fmln together with the UN Secretary General, who will announce the mechanisms to be followed in this dialogue between the government and the Fmln . What do the armed forces think about the eight bombs that were detonated yesterday and killed six soldiers and one civilian? What do you think about this now, since it is evident that explosives are again being used against the people? we, the armed forces, feel that these events are carried out by the terrorists within the Fmln who do not believe dialogue is a mechanism for Achieiving peace in our country . These individuals believe that violence is what will lead them to power."
1207,DEV-MUC3-1208,SAN SALVADOR,1990-04-03,"They are completely out of context in history . They had clearly announced that they would not use car bombs from now on, but they used one yesterday Nevertheless . This action is Condemnable from every viewpoint because the members, rather the Alumni, of Cetipol who were victims of this attack were unarmed . They were simply doing some physical exercises . It is also deplorable that a Baker was killed and that a 12-year-old youth going to school was injured . We believe that these events do not contribute at all to the creation of the appropriate atmosphere for seeking peace in our country . This and many other acts of violence which have recently occurred contradict the image that the Fmln had previously tried to create with its decision not to continue sabotaging the public transportation and communications sectors, as well as businesses . all these actions have continued to occur . We want to believe that these actions have been carried out by terrorists who are out of the Fmln leaders' control, because, as I said, this does not help at all to create the appropriate atmosphere in which to seek peace in our country . Colonel, referring to the state of siege, will the armed forces insist on keeping it or not? the legislative assembly President commented on this yesterday . This is a political decision anyway, and it is adopted by the Assembly--sometimes upon request from...the defense Ministry, you said . We, as an armed Corps and with the intention of helping create the appropriate atmosphere for peace in our country, will make no request to extend the state of emergency and . does this mean that the armed forces decided this because the situation of violence has disappeared? taking into account the fact that current violent actions might come from groups outside the control of Fmln leaders, we believe that the country's situation is not normal enough to say that there is no violence . However, as a contribution to that propitious atmosphere for the dialogue, I believe that it is advisable to lift it . I have two questions: what is the armed forces' position regarding? as for the first question, you are referring to statements by the President of the Republic . I believe that in due time he will have the opportunity to explain those statements . I understand that the newsman distorted his words, but the President himself will have an opportunity to make the respective clarification . I will, however, state that according to the reports that have been issued by the director general of the national police as to whether at any time Colonel Benavides has left the hands of the national police, he clearly said that at no time has Benavides done this . He is under the orders of the 4TH penal judge, and at no time has the 4TH penal judge authorized Col. Benavides to leave the confines of the jail . The person who made the accusations should present some evidence, a photograph for example . Otherwise, this is all mere speculation . that is a very delicate case, and speculations cast a negative image on the armed forces and the country itself, and even on the administration of justice in our country . concerning what could happen in the trial of the murder of the Jesuits, the justice authorities will determine what will be done . We will respect that decision."

1209,DEV-MUC3-1210,SAN SALVADOR,1990-03-30,"International news dispatches have reported on President Alfredo Cristiani's remarks about why the Nefarious death squads have appeared and still thrive in the country . Cristiani's remarks, made in Caracas, have been the cause of concern for local and foreign observers because he uses a strange and twisted logic to analyze the Salvadoran social reality . He has said that the death squads appeared in response to the formation of the Farabundo Marti National liberation front . Even worse, he said that these squads will continue to operate in our country as long as the Fmln continues to carry out political and military activities . Cristiani's remarks have called the attention of Udn, which cannot help but reject and refute assertions designed to confuse the local and foreign public opinion on the true causes of violence in the country and the Fmln's appearance and development in the National scenario . First, Cristiani's assertions represent moral support for the groups and bands of assassins who, embedded in and protected by the structures of political and economic power, have assassinated with impunity tens of thousands of lowly Salvadorans . Second, Cristiani mistakes the case for the effect by saying that``violence Engenders violence""and that, therefore, there will be death squads as long as there are guerrillas . The truth is that the death squads were active even before the Fmln was organized . has Cristiani perhaps forgotten the assassinations perpetrated by the White hand, the White war Union, and other groups that have been spreading terror for many years? third, violence and hostility have always been present in El Salvador since the Spanish invasion and conquest and workers have always been favorite victims . We hereby state this, fully cognizant of the country's history . The violence of the people has responded, as a last ditch resort, to the generalized violence of the Salvadoran government and state . Let us keep in mind our forebears' resistance to the Spanish invaders; the peasants' and Indians' persistent rebellion against the social injustice of colonial times; the heroic actions and the patriotic attempts that culminated in independence; Anastasio Aquino's rebellion; the peasants' and Indians' resistance to working for the new landowners who dispossessed them of their common lands during the 1881 agrarian reform; the rebellion of workers and peasants in 1932; the historic action against dictator Martinez in 1944; the rank and file struggle against tyrant Lemus; the people's struggle against the electoral imposition in the 1970's; and the unyielding struggle of an entire people for democracy and peace with social justice, which is currently underway."
1210,DEV-MUC3-1211,CLANDESTINE,,"Commander, the fighters, even Salvadoran citizens in general, do not understand certain attitudes of the Fmln or some of the communiques issued by the Fmln general command . We spent eight or nine years fighting the Christian Democratic party and Jose Napoleon Duarte . We remember the assassination of Herbert Anaya Sanabria . However, when Duarte died, a communique was issued declaring a truce so that the funeral could take place peacefully . How should we view all of these apparent changes of position by the Fmln? as for Jose Napoleon Duarte, we have to point out that addition to being a political force, the Fmln has human sensitivity . We thought it was appropriate for us to take this humane action by declaring a truce so that Mr. Duarte could be buried . We also have to mention that the Pdc and all of the leftist forces of the country can contribute toward the Depolarization of society . The truce was a gesture, it was to make the Salvadoran people see that it is possible to Depolarize society and that each of us can make a contribution . that is why we insist that one must not return to one's electoral or political Hegemonic plans, because that would obstruct the unity of the people, which is needed to isolate the fascists . commander, there was a discussion at the legislative assembly when Duarte died because the Pdc legislators motioned to name him the father of democracy in El Salvador . What is the difference between Jose Napoleon Duarte, who was in power for almost 10 years, and Roberto D'Aubuisson? What is the difference between these two politicians? We believe that Duarte was a fighter for democracy . He had his own beliefs, he had his own personality, and he really had charisma; we cannot deny that . of course, we cannot compare him to a criminal who is being sought by justice . I would say that D'Aubuisson is a fugitive from justice, who has sought shelter from his immunity as a deputy . His immunity as a deputy does not preclude his crimes . There is no comparison between Duarte and who is well-known, but is violent and unpopular . to end the first part of the interview, are you optimistic about a possible concerted effort by popular and democratic forces in the country or do you believe that each will go his own way . are you optimistic about a concerted effort? a concerted effort in a political struggle of all the forces in the country should not only be seen as a possibility, but must be seen as a political necessity for the unity of all popular and national sectors, because this would be the only formula to rebuild the country, to reunite the country, and to reconcile the country . This can only be done with a concerted political effort . I believe there will be opportunities over the next few months for concerted political efforts, which will really give new hope to the large majority of the Salvadoran people . We must not forget about the large majority of the Salvadoran people, because sometimes we speak on behalf of certain groups of the country and not on behalf of the majorities."

1224,DEV-MUC3-1225,HAVANA ,1990-04-05,"Various internal and external factors have made possible the meeting in Oslo, Norway's capital . at the end of March, a Guatemalan national revolutionary Army delegation, representing its general command, met with a national reconciliation Commission delegation, accredited to support the Guatemalan government and Army to find a political solution to the very grave crisis that is affecting the country in general . It is worth noting that the political will and broad initiative repeatedly displayed by the Urng general command, which seeks a political solution to the internal armed conflict with their participation, has received widespread welcome among the population and has caused great domestic and international repercussions resulting in the approval and support of a broad and representative segment of Guatemalan political and social sectors . as may be recalled, it has been the military and government who have Obstinately refused to talk to the Guatemalan armed insurgents . This highlights the weaknesses, isolation, and contradictions within the Army and the ruling Christian Democratic party . The Army's sector most reluctant to talk with the guerrillas is bent on resolving Guatemala's armed conflict by way of the military, notwithstanding that it contradictorily refuses to acknowledge their existence . It is this sector that the troops and some officers--not precisely the Self-Named mountain officers--blame for the hard setbacks and severe blows inflicted by the guerrilla forces, the failure of the Counterinsurgency strategy, and the Army being bogged down . for the military leadership under these conditions, the situation is something like an alley, the way out of which could be seen if defense Minister general Hector Gramajo opted to follow and respect the letter and spirit of the Oslo agreements . in the case of Guatemala, however, it is not just simply ending an undeclared war that has lasted nearly 30 years . in the opinion of the Guatemalan Revolutionaries, the help of all who favor democracy and peace is needed to lay down the basis for a great national accord that will ensure for Guatemala a serious process of dialogue and talks so as to resolve the historic and root structural causes that have generated the domestic armed conflict, which still remains intact . These justify and give validity to the Democratic project, and the patriotic and popular struggle by the armed Guatemalan revolutionary movement . compliance and implementation of the basic agreement to seek peace through political means, signed in the Norwegian capital on 30 April, depends then on the will and political attitude of the sides in the conflict . The Guatemalan Revolutionaries are precisely the ones who have shown the most willingness and will, and who have made the most efforts in favor of peace in Guatemala . their widespread political and diplomatic initiatives and their meaningful advances in the battlefield permit the insurgents to sit down at the negotiating table with enough resources and conditions to ensure that the Oslo agreements are respected and complied with; that Guatemala enters into a true process of democracy in its institutions and structures, with broad national support and international solidarity; and that peace is reestablished--an honorable peace with dignity that guarantees social justice and independence, progress, and wellbeing."

In general Pinochet's opinion, Chile was at war for the 16 years of the dictatorship . curiously, the alleged Allied camp, the Western countries through their Chiefs of state, refused to talk with him or extend him invitations . Furthermore, it was considered disgraceful to have any links with the reigning regime that had violated every type of human right according to 16 sentences handed down by the United Nations . for the United States, relations with Chile were annoying and that country made it known . The dictatorship's Commandos travelled to Washington to kill Orlando Letelier . for this operation they violated borders and laws with false Passports to conduct this terrorist act that is still considered a black mark against Chilean justice . never in the history of Chilean-U.S. relations have things been so low as during the past 16 years . only in light of this background data can the importance of George Bush's visit be evaluated . all this marks the beginning of a new era with the Re-Instatement of our nation in the place that it has always historically occupied, the recovery of our influence, and the importance of this country's future commitments .

Nine people died and approximately 50 were wounded when a car loaded with 200 kg of dynamite exploded in a heavily populated district in Medellin known as Las Americas . police sources said that the car bomb, which was camouflaged with construction waste, was set off by remote control at a passing elite police patrol . The explosion seriously damaged over 10 private vehicles and at least three buses with passengers as well as a dozen business establishments and private residences . Defense Minister general Oscar Botero Restrepo said that the attack was the work of the Extraditables, the armed wing of the Medellin cartel, one of the biggest drug processing and drug trafficking organizations in the world . Medellin, Colombia's second largest city, is the home of the cartel and of its armed wing--the Extraditables--which described themselves in March as a Political-Military organization and declared war on the Colombian state . The Extraditables announced at the time that they were Relegating their struggle to prevent the Extradition of COLOMBIANS to the United States to second place and that their top priority would be to fight the state, the Oligarchy and the members of the police who Kidnap, torture and murder the members of their organization and their families . yesterday's attack was the second to be carried out against Colombia's special antidrug and Counterinsurgency elite police Corps . On 11 March another car bomb loaded with over 100 kg of dynamite was exploded against a police vehicle on the freeway south of Medellin . eight policemen and nine civilians were killed in the explosion."
1236,DEV-MUC3-1237,BOGOTA,1990-04-26,"Government Minister Horacio Serpa Uribe, who has just left the National social welfare Institute, has denounced Carlos Pizarro Leongomez' assassination . He added that no thought has been given to suspending the elections in the wake of this development, and added that the country must not be left in violent hands . The government Minister commented further on the top M-19 leader's assassination: the occurrence of such sad and criminal developments is truly a disgrace . It has saddened everybody very much . I feel that this was not only an attack against former candidate Pizarro but an attack against the country, democracy, and the electoral process . I feel that we must respond to aggressiveness and crime with feelings of conciliation and peace . has any thought been given to suspending the elections after this assassination, bearing in mind that Pizarro was one of the most important candidates? he was undoubtedly one of the most important candidates . The government always thought so . In addition, the government highly regards the Peacemking process it has been carrying out with the M-19, in which Pizarro was undoubtedly a key Player . We have adopted some decisions in this regard . I am going to meet with the head of State and all of us will be closely watching the sad developments which Colombia is experiencing with a desire to meet the need for tranquillity and coexistence which, unfortunately, we have not had thus far . Mr. Minister, what does the fact that two Presidential candidates have been assassinated in less than 40 days represent to the government? How does the government look before the nation and the world? well, I repeat, this is a very sad circumstance . This is extremely worrisome, of course . like all COLOMBIANS, we are troubled over the fact that we are constantly being flooded with crime and bloodshed . The government is doing the impossible to protect all citizens and to guarantee the elections and the normal development of COLOMBIANS' lives . However, there are deluded minds and there are criminals who are interested in damaging the country . This is an attack against Colombia, against the Colombian people . Mr. Minister, have you at any time thought of adopting special measures? What is the status of the public order situation in Colombia at this time? What reports do you have? no, there is calm in general . The government is very worried, of course . We are going to meet now to discuss this terrible case . However, do you not think that it is very difficult to go on campaigning in public at this moment? I would not dare make any assertion in this regard . What I feel is that we must not yield a single centimeter to the violent people and the criminals . Serpa made these statements a few minutes ago as he left the National social welfare Institute, where an autopsy is being performed at this moment on Pizarro's body."
1237,DEV-MUC3-1238,SAN SALVADOR,,"The important thing is that this is the government's clarification, which represents the government's stand . David Rivas of AFP . Mr. President, your replies to previous questions have already answered my first question . I would like to ask you something, however . Now that the dialogue process is about to start, the two sides have apparently hardened their positions . The Fmln commanders have said that, to end the war in El Salvador, there must be a solution to the problems of injustice and lack of democracy . The Minister of justice, in turn, said recently that the Fmln must return to civilian life and that there is no need to negotiate . I would like to know what will be negotiated and what will be done to end the war through a dialogue with the Fmln . I am surprised by the remarks that you are attributing to Dr. Santamaria, because he is very well informed about what has happened so far . He is very much aware that there is point two of the Geneva agreement, which notes that political agreements must be reached in order to put an end to armed confrontation and the violence that is affecting the civilian population . subsequently, there will be a process for disarmament and demobilization, referred to as the total suspension of hostilities in the agreement . I believe that it is a matter of reaching agreements . We, as a government, are involved in this because we see the suffering of the Salvadoran people . We believe that it is not fair for them to live in a climate of violence in which there are so many killed, so much destruction, and so many problems . as a government, we have always asked: What are the problems barring their returning to civilian life? they are the only group that has not joined the Salvadoran democratic process . What do they want? let us see if there is anything reasonable that can be done . The political parties have expressed willingness to consider all that could foster or consolidate the democratic process in our country . We believe that there will be no problems . I cannot see any hardening by the government . I believe we have been flexible . We have said that the government has been immediately accepting as its own any consensus reached by the parties . In other words, at least your remark on the government is not true . I repeat, perhaps in the style of the previous question, that we do not want to be Biased . In due time, we will see whether the Fmln has or has not been inflexible or hardened or whatever . It will depend on whether the Fmln's proposals are reasonable or not . Pablo Yacu of . Mr. President, concerning the economy, some of the opposition politicians I talked with over the past few days have told me that they are a little concerned . They think that, because difficulties have arisen, because there is a new situation in the country, and because the volume of the U.S. aid has diminished, the country is rapidly taking steps that other Latin American countries have already taken, to meet with the so-called consulting group formed by the leading world credit institutions and request large loans to stabilize the balance of payments . These politicians told me that they are concerned because this would impose a heavy burden on the new government, which would assume office after 1994 . Well, I think the opposition politicians should try to understand that many of the measures, which certainly entail a sacrifice for the various national sectors, are responsibly taken because of the country's economic and social problems . many people will say it is not necessary to do this or that . I would only look at what has happened to other countries which, even without the destruction and violence caused by an irregular force, such as the Fmln, have experienced much more serious problems than those encountered by El Salvador at present . We would also encounter those problems if we fail to take measures . nearby is Nicaragua, the inflation rate of which has reached 1,700 percent, its foreign debt is enormous, and it is immersed in dramatic problems . No measures were taken in due time in Brazil and Argentina, although these measures were painful . If they are not taken on time, they will be much more painful later, because eventually something will have to be done to check the economic crisis that has been created . at this time, we are trying to stabilize the economy to start its effective recovery . It is based on this recovery that we will avoid foreign indebtedness, which for many other countries has been an easy way out and an alternative, when they should have acted responsibly concerning economic problems."
1238,DEV-MUC3-1239,SAN SALVADOR,,"Yes, I think that you should tell this to the judge at the 4TH penal court . frankly, as I said, this case is now in the hands of the court . The judge is the one who can order future investigations into the case . your questions relate to doubts and concerns that the judge has before him . He can summon anyone to testify . I understand that he has already summoned some top officers . I can only say this: you have just mentioned a meeting in which supposedly I was present . You also said that it was at that meeting that the murder was planned . There is much speculation, therefore I think that we must remain Cool-Headed . In other words, people are speculating when they say that this could happen, this could have happened, or this could not have happened . for example, some have said that there is a cover up, but Colonel Rivas himself was the one who discovered who committed the crime . There are many questions, which is natural . However, that does not mean that...for example, I made a statement for the program``60 minutes ;""I was interviewed for an hour and a half, but obviously my replies were not aired for some reason . However, I said that it is no secret in our country that there have been many people, a great number of people, who feel that at one time or another some of the Jesuit priests were in fact linked to the Fmln . Therefore, in this case, all those who have said anything to that effect would have to be investigated . would that be called for? What I mean is that it is very difficult to make a decision based on speculation . Furthermore, during the investigations--conducted by the investigative Commission of criminal actions, an auxiliary legal organ--we thought it was convenient at a given time, since we had enough evidence on a group of people we believe committed the crime, that the case should be handled by the judicial branch . Therefore, the judicial branch today continues to investigate the case and decides whether to Interrogate someone or not . If there is any doubt, the judicial branch can order the Commission to investigate this or that . whether someone is Interrogated by a judge or by the Commission is irrelevant; the judge must decide . I believe that in this case the judge should investigate . As I said before, I think that there has been progress . I understand that the honor Commission will be summoned, and that another may be summoned afterward . could you tell us in English . You said that you do not think that it is necessary, that many people have criticized the Jesuits, and if you are going to start investigating people, why not investigate everyone who has criticized the Jesuits . The fact remains, however, that not everybody is in a position to Reprove the Jesuits, not everyone was in the military hierarchy, not everyone was involved in the Alto Mando . There are people in the Alto Mando who are known to hate the Jesuits, who are known to have criticized them in the past . Why do you not think that this would be correct for those people to be investigated directly? first of all, I would say that the vast majority of officers in the armed forces at one point or another, whether lately or earlier, that there was a widespread belief of some sort of participation by the...some of the Jesuit priests with the Fmln . This is not for us at this point and time to decide whether it is true or untrue . It is simply something that was believed out there, and therefore, it is up to the judge to decide whether he will only interview one person who believed this, or whether he is going to interview many people . There has been also the fact that it well could have been the Act of the Fmln, the Act of individual groups . There were also speculations at the beginning when the assassination was committed as to who could have committed the crime . So there are other groups that could have committed the crime, and therefore, there could be others that we could have followed the investigating . But, I think it is all up to the judge now who will he call to testify, who will he call to Interrogate, and if he finds any need, he has all the power to instruct the investigative unit to follow through on anything that he reaches . It is not up to executive branch right now to decide who is going to come up with testimony with the judge . It is up to the judge to decide."
1239,DEV-MUC3-1240,SAN SALVADOR,,"Rolando Gonzalez, Los Angeles times . Mr. President, I want to make a question that was made in Spanish before and it's related about Colonel Ochoa Perez . He has been a hard-line military and don't you think that his got to be possible? this is one and I got a second one . can you tell us in English what's going to be the relation with the new Nicaraguan government and what do you know about recent machinegun traffic of the guerrillas? well, with the first case my opinion is that anybody that has any information with respect to the assassination of the Jesuit priests should--instead of speculate with it publicly--should go straight to the court that is in charge of the case and give all the information available to him or that he is knowledgeable of, and then have the judge do something about it . I think that mere speculation in public is something that is not good for the judicial process because it creates problems for it . Secondly, even though he was a High-Ranking officer, in cases like this, it is not necessarily the opinion of a specific member of the armed forces is one which is totally true or totally false . You cannot simply go by that as a way to simply state that his statements are true . It is very interesting to see that whereas before no one really would believe Col. Ochoa, all of a sudden everyone wants to give him all the credibility in this case . I am not saying that what he said is true or untrue . My point is that it should not be debated publicly; that anybody--Col. Ochoa, members of the Jesuit community, or anybody else--who has any information with respect to the trial should go to the judge and give him that information because that would be helping the process and not mere speculations in public . with respect to the relations with Nicaragua, we discussed this with one of the advisers of Mrs. Chamorro during our visit and we decided to initiate plans and, therefore, we are willing to Reinitiate the process . Her adviser was very clear to state that they will by no means aid the Fmln in that respect . We think that what has been happening between the 25th of February and the 25th of April is that the Fmln thought that it was time to get all that was left in Nicaragua .... [corrects himself) out of Nicaragua because they knew of the problems they would face with the new government, and that they could no longer go about freely in Nicaragua with their weapons and their logistic support . Therefore, they have been trying to bring them in . in that case there was a group of Fmln members who were detained in Honduras with the help of the Honduran authorities, and it was obvious that they had been shipping weapons by land through Honduran territory, but that group was detained . Thank you, Mr. president; thank you, Mr. foreign minister . journalists, thank you."
1240,DEV-MUC3-1241,BOGOTA,1990-04-26,"Good evening . We COLOMBIANS had not gotten over yesterday's cruel attack in Medellin when we were confronted with another disgrace that took the life of Presidential candidate Carlos Pizarro . in a message from the President of the Republic, the government voiced its deep anger and sadness over this criminal attack and it ratified its determination to continue to struggle without dismay against all forms of crimes and the criminals who are so Infamously attacking peace and democracy . This is no time to abandon any attitude that is deemed advisable for the nation . in the face of the Fratricidal and Anti-Patriotic violence, we must answer with actions of understanding and conciliation, with decisions that will dismantle the bands of criminals who are doing such serious harm to the people and with the determination that will renew faith in democratic principles and in the purpose to achieve the best levels of coexistence . The government is determined to do that . However, this responsibility lies with all COLOMBIANS of goodwill . from each of our fellow countrymen, we demand positive actions and a great solidarity with those who have the responsibility of safeguarding the citizens' security throughout the nation . The peace, understanding, and conciliation to which Carlos Pizarro was committed should continue to be the basic goals of the country and of its citizens . all the necessary measures that will lead to clarifying that treacherous crime are being taken to determine who is responsible and then punish them . to this effect, the government's action will be very severe, and the investigating authorities are already being provided very ample cooperation . The government maintains direct communications with the 19 April movement leaders, and it has been attentive to its demands, charges, and concerns . There is a marked interest because there continues to be direct relations with all political parties, the various political and social associations, and the Presidential candidates concerning the implementation and effectiveness of security and indispensable guarantees so that we will hold the elections on 27 may, as the people want . National coexistence, together with the citizens' demands for reforms, will continue to be a basic goal of the government of Dr. Virgilio Barco, who will tomorrow address the COLOMBIANS . M-19 has asked the government to allow it to make public its feelings and opinions in the face of this great tragedy . through me, and according to the provisions of law 42 of 1985, the government has requested this air time so that Antonio Navarro Wolff, spokesman of the political party whose presidential candidate was brutally murdered today, will be able to freely express his ideas . those who seek to exclude from the electoral process a political party--regardless of which one it may be--will not achieve it, because the government will guarantee that its voice will continue to be heard . Despite of the difficulties, Colombian democracy will win."
1241,DEV-MUC3-1242,BOGOTA,1990-04-24,"The leftist patriotic Union today asked Colombian President Virgilio Barco to be admitted to the negotiations that the government is holding with diverse political groups to reach an agreement that will permit the introduction of national constitutional reforms . The up national directorate met today with Barco and gave him a letter noting that the exclusion of social forces in the negotiations may again be a mockery of the people . It again asked for protection for the lives of its Militants . Since it was founded in 1985, more than 1,000 up members have been killed throughout the country . The up explains in its letter that the assassination on 22 March of Bernardo Jaramillo, its presidential candidate, forced it to withdraw from the 27 may elections . This did not deter it, however, from its struggle for a Plebiscite and from calling for a national, popular and Democratic constituent assembly . The up added that a constituent Assembly, which will represent all popular sectors, will be charged with drafting constitutional reforms . The reforms must then be submitted to a Plebiscite . a week ago, the liberal party, social conservative party , 19 April movement, and national salvation movement met to try to reach an agreement that will permit holding a national Plebiscite on 27 May to approve substantial reforms to the state . government Minister Horacio Serpa Uribe stated that the administration has not and does not seek to impose its criteria on the will to effect constitutional reform . He added that the government's position is very clear and seeks to respond to the will of the people . Also, the up convened political parties, social forces, students, and COLOMBIANS in general who were excluded from these negotiations, to unite a proposal on the 27 may Plebiscite . Finally, the up directorate asked, as a contribution to peace in the country, to be able to meet with the Rebel forces."
1242,DEV-MUC3-1243,BOGOTA,1990-04-27,"Colombians, during these months of national tragedy we have been hit by events over and over again . violence strikes the hearts of our institutions, values, democracy, and our best men . The ultimate goal of those engaged in violence is to prevent democracy from functioning . that is why they have unleashed their evil against options for changes that could strengthen democracy and prevent violence in Colombia . brave COLOMBIANS have been murdered, one by one . their existence was a threat to the survival of violent practices . It is not a coincidence that during the current electoral campaign three Presidential candidates have been murdered . It is not a coincidence either that other brave minds that advocated reform had been killed before in that struggle . Rodrigo Lara, who was murdered six years on 23 April, was the first to denounce the grave effects of drug trafficking on the stability of our institutions . those who killed him wanted to open paths for the so-called crime tolerance . Guillermo Cano, a brave newsman, represented a free, critical press, such as is needed in a true democracy . His killers thought that by drowning out his voice they would intimidate the defenders of freedom of speech . Luis Carlos Galan was killed eight months ago . by killing him, they sought to assassinate a hope of renovation and change and a deep conviction for the need to radically transform political habits and the climate of corruption, immorality, and indifference in the face of crime . This indifference led to the emergence of the great evils that are causing bloodshed in the country . Bernardo Jaramillo struggled for a peaceful, democratic left that rejected armed struggle and that wanted to build a more just society . by killing him, the criminals sought to block the paths to legitimate protest within the law . Carlos Pizarro, the last link in this macabre chain that includes so many others, represented the possibility for guerrilla groups to lay down their weapons and join institutional politics, or for weapons to be replaced by legal instruments to struggle for legitimate ideals . by killing him in a Dastardly and cowardly manner yesterday, they sought to destroy the process of reconciliation and reincorporation of armed groups into civil life . The death of our countrymen should not be in vain . It strikes deep in our hearts . It affects the spirit profoundly . It must, therefore, awaken the national conscience, because those crimes are not merely vile crimes against unarmed great men who believed in the strength of ideals . These have been crimes against our basic values, against the clean ideals of progress and peace that these men represented . We must not be mistaken . those who killed our leaders did not extinguish the noble cause for which they gave their lives . their values will prevail . They are our values . their hopes still live . those hopes belong to all COLOMBIANS . their dream will never disappear . It is the dream we all have of attaining peace and prosperity . that is why I praise what Antonio Navarro said last night:``I invite the M-19 to continue walking along the path that Pizarro charted . terrorism's goal has been to close the paths to change, renovation, and reform . Our path, on the contrary, is to make peaceful, democratic revolution viable . It is a revolution of hope . This deep crisis will not be solved by restrictions and limitations imposed on the instruments of democracy, but by uniting efforts of all good COLOMBIANS to repair the roads to change, renovation, and reform."
1243,DEV-MUC3-1244,BOGOTA,1990-04-27,"I am happy that Navarro, over the television, called for common sense and for Pizarro's funeral to be conducted in peace tomorrow . In accordance with the law, the government will continue to do everything possible so that the M-19 and the other political parties can carry on their campaign activities . The government and I have fully supported the Army, the police, the Das, and all of the authorities charged with maintaining order . These agencies are aware of their responsibility and are making great efforts to carry out their duties efficiently . at this time, there is a tendency to overlook the results achieved in the struggle against the violent ones and the significant progress achieved . I understand the impatience and the desire for definitive results against not only drug trafficking but all other expressions of violence as well . I will now mention some of the measures that complement those that have already been taken . The government has proposed the creation of a high-level Commission, in which the political parties are represented, to follow up the electoral process and to assess the security measures that the public force and the security organizations have been providing for all candidates . This Commission can by itself propose new measures to reinforce the electoral guarantees in various areas . In addition, the government minister and those in charge of security will meet with representatives of each of the political campaigns to consider the existing protection measures . The Commission met with the M-19 at the Security Council today and will meet with the other political movements in the next few days . The government has made efforts to provide the best possible protection for all of the candidates . The government will continue to work to reduce the risk of each of the candidates to its lowest level . for this reason, the goverment will revise the existing situation regarding mobilization and location of the candidates . Also, the government will double the number of elite policemen, who have demonstrated the greatest efficiency in the struggle against drug terrorism and the paramilitary groups . The 1ST Army division commander has been assigned the specific task of coordinating all forces, security agencies, and military operations in the Medellin area . the country knows that this government has encouraged a broad, Participative constitutional reform process . two years ago, the government proposed a Plebiscite and then presented to the Congress a constitutional amendments bill . In this way, the government interpreted the National feeling, which demands a more efficient administration of justice and even more stringent Antiterrorist measures, for which it is necessary to amend the Constitution . The government also echoed the people's call for stronger institutions and a more efficient and representative Congress . COLOMBIANS know that the current evils will be definitively overcome by expanding and strengthening our democracy even further, creating opportunities for the citizens' participation in the decisions that concern them most . I want to reaffirm that the government is determined to do Eveything necessary so that in the next elections we can pave the way for constitutional reforms."
1244,DEV-MUC3-1245,BOGOTA,1990-04-27,"Fellow countrymen: the murder of Carlos Pizarro sought both to disrupt the development of the electoral process, as well as to destroy the process of reconciliation that the government and M- 19 had carefully built, surpassing numerous obstacles . It also seeks to weaken the state and make COLOMBIANS lose faith in democratic institutions . However, those who foment violence will not manage to weaken a strong democracy that is supported by all COLOMBIANS or to destroy the path of peace that we have built after so many difficulties . two of these difficulties stem back more than five decades . The first difficulty was to build an atmosphere of peace in a country where the violence we have inherited flared up in the fifties, and after having evolved, it has taken on different forms, such as Narco-Terrorism and bands of hired assassins encouraged by groups of the extreme right . The second obstacle, along with the previous one, is the lack of tolerance for political pluralism . Even progressive ideas are many times considered dangerous by people who do not realize that the cold war is over . A Pluralist democracy is not afraid of communism . on the contrary, it ACCEPTS communism, but it does not accept violence, regardless of its source . the use of weapons both to defend an ideology, as well as to fight against it, is unacceptable in a Pluralist democracy . The persons responsible for the tragic murder of Carlos Pizarro will not manage to destroy what has been been achieved, that is, a clear, viable, and defined path to peace . The obligation we have ahead of us and that we will carry out United is to keep that path of peace open . All COLOMBIANS admire the peace initiatives of the M-19, and we share the grief of the relatives and followers of Carlos Pizarro, because their sadness and anger is shared by all COLOMBIANS who love peace . facts show that the M-19 members wisely adopted the decision to rejoin democracy and remain in democracy, to struggle for peace, and to promote legally the reforms they consider necessary . When they abandoned their weapons, they did not abandon the struggle for their ideals . They have all their rights, because they are no longer a guerrilla group . M-19 is now a political party, with all rights and duties of a political party and whose ideas should be tolerated . those who, through violence, are trying to bring down the M-19 flag and to prevent its candidates from running in the elections and to stop them from conducting political campaigning, are not just the enemies of that movement, they are the enemies of peace . They are trying to destroy the path that was built for the reincorporation of the guerrilla groups into civilian life . The material and intellectual authors of Carlos Pizarro's murder are the enemies of democracy, because they hope to sabotage the elections and prevent new opportunities for political participation . The government will not allow the voice of M-19 to be silenced . Therefore, the government yesterday requested Airtime on television so that Antonio Navarro Wolff, leader of that party, could express his opinions to all COLOMBIANS."
1245,DEV-MUC3-1246,BOGOTA,1990-04-27,"When the convergence of opinions on the fundamental aspects of the creation of a constituent assembly is made public, the government will contribute toward the counting of the relevant ballot papers . The government believes it is necessary to reduce as much as possible the risk for each of the candidates . Despite the strict security measures taken by Carlos Pizarro, the suicidal calling of a hired assassin at the service of evil interests ended his life . In view of these totally irrational methods, large numbers of Bodyguards, Bulletproof vests, and practical security measures could help, but they are not enough . It is necessary for authorities and campaign officials to take maximum precautionary measures . There must be more modern and direct communication with the people . I admire the courage of the candidates who have gone to public squares, but we all know that the health of democracy and the stability of institutions depends on the lives of the candidates . So this campaign can take place under the best of conditions without the need for candidates to run the risks involved in traditional forms of Proselytism, the government has decided to increase television time for the Presidential candidates of the parties and movements that are represented in Congress, on both national and regional channels . In addition, the government will allow the free use of radio stations for the same purpose and will give more opportunities for advertisements . We are trying for a more modern campaign in which new techniques can be used to explain the programs of the candidates so that they can directly make contact with citizens and their families in their own homes . Besides, the government will intensify its civic campaign by inviting all citizens to vote in the next elections . their vote for any of the candidates or even a blank vote is an expression of the people's rejection of violence . It is a way of resolving conflicts by peaceful and Democratic means . to actively participate in the next elections is to vote for peace, for democracy and tolerance . amid the situation in which this country is living, voting is an obligation . No citizen with a right to vote can afford to remain at home and remain indifferent."
1246,DEV-MUC3-1247,TEGUCIGALPA,1990-04-23,"What I have to say this evening is that we made a correct decision . The Armed Forces' budget was reduced by 10 percent; to ask for a greater reduction is not to know our country's reality and to destroy the armed forces . to reduce the Honduran armed forces' budget by 50 percent is tantamount to dismantling it, and I for one am not willing to make that decision . I agreed to take the correct path at the right moment; to redirect the Honduran armed forces and to see they also act with austerity and in the best national interest . It is easy to criticize and say things, but when these people had the opportunity to resolve this, nothing was done . I have acted . German Reyes of Acan-Efe . good evening . Before anything else I think we should apologize to the housewives for having ruined their soap opera . regarding the green battalions you mentioned, Mr. President, which are going to be installed in Yamales--where they should have been before the Contras entered--how are the Onuca officers going to verify that the Contra withdrawal from Honduran territory? there is no problem . The Yamales camp is inside Honduran territory . There are mechanisms that allow Onuca and Ciav forces to control these persons . once more I would like to refer to the position you are taking: why not see things positively? instead of saying we had Contras here for 10 years, say that now we do not have any . I think this is the type of optimism we should impress upon the country . Let us not complain about yesterday, instead build on today's reality . I am very happy to be here at this news conference and to be able to tell my fellow citizens and you that no longer are we to have Contras in Honduras--a positive step . In this regard the green battalions and the armed forces are taking action to administer a territory that only yesterday was relatively out of control of the government . Mr. President, much has been said about these $247 million--it seems like a large sum--which tells of the success of your trip to the United States . This, however, is to be used to pay debts . do you know of any specific amounts you may be receiving in the future, or is it a question of having to wait there with a little paper bag to then hand it over to don Ricardo Maduro? What are the resource forecasts and what definite investment plans are there for these resources? one must especially take into account the impact this will have on the central bank currency reserves since inflation can be a time bomb . Lastly, I would like to ask you if you .... apparently my colleague Regina has an important question before you end the conference with me . Thank you, Mr. President . No problem . I would continue this conference all night long, although I do not wish to keep the housewives from their programs . However, everything has a time frame and our interest is that all reporters here tonight should have the opportunity of taking part in this news conference . getting back to your question, the total amount of funds available for the armed forces was established this way: the 1989 budget approved by Congress was 150 million Lempiras . Perhaps I did not make myself clear . I was referring to the funds the government would have available once loans were paid off with these stopgap loans . You are right . We are talking about the stopgap financing for $247 million . This stopgap loan opens the path so that friendly countries and bilateral and multilateral financial organizations can resume their loans to the country . These funds will give us the right to draw on special IMF accounts, funds from special World Bank programs such as Sal-1 and Sal-2, or funds that have been withheld from Japan and Germany . The total amount of these funds is enough to pay the $247 million stopgap loan in full and still have some cash left over for some of these organizations that may generate funds for the country . The precise amounts will be given by the central bank president; however, to answer your question, the amount of funds to be received will be no less than the amount being loaned, plus some surpluses from international organizations and friendly countries, which have withheld their loans or donations because of Honduras' Ineligibility with the IMF."

1248,DEV-MUC3-1249,BOGOTA,1990-04-29,"Following the funeral of M-19 President Carlos Pizarro Leongomez, the group's new presidential candidate Antonio Navarro Wolff said that his group will continue the struggle for peace . The M-19, the organization that signed a peace agreement with President Virgilio Barco's government on 8 March and laid down its weapons on 9 March to become a political party, said that it will not pick up its weapons again as a result of the murder of the 39-year-old Pizarro . Pizarro was buried yesterday . only 50 days after rejoining civilian life following more than 20 years of armed struggle, Pizarro became a symbol for peace, although, according to commentators, with his death his killers are attempting to destabilize the country . When accepting the Presidential nomination, Antonio Navarro Wolff, a 42-Year-Old engineer, former dean of a university, rebel, and the oldest of seven brothers and sisters, said that he was running for President for that Colombia which wants democracy and wishes to live in peace . The new M-19 presidential candidate was forced to speak and accept the nomination when Pizarro's funeral procession made a stop at the home of the Liberator Simon bolivar . He said that the Colombian people must unite to make harmony possible, and he urged everyone to contribute to a future of peace, a better future for coming generations . Speaking before Pizarro's Casket, which was draped with the Colombian flag, Navarro, who in 1985 survived an attack during which he lost a leg, swore to fight for peace as Pizarro had done . The thousands of persons who attended Saturday's funeral carried Placards with slogans that read: commander Pizarro, we continue forward, and comrade Pizarro, we are for peace, we swear . others who joined the thousands of voices asking Navarro to accept the Presidential nomination broke the silence on several occasions to chant: Pizarro present, Navarro President . Pizarro's mother Margot de Pizarro, along with his lady friend Laura, spoke at the grave site and asked the crowd to fight for peace as he had always done . at the cemetery the new presidential candidate again addressed the crowd, who had followed the more than Seven-Hour-Long funeral procession from the cathedral to Simon bolivar's home and then to the cemetery . He said: together with all the good COLOMBIANS, we are going to change the course of history . He added that Pizarro's murder was useless because the M-19 will continue its struggle for peace . Pizarro's funeral was held in Bogota . The authorities praised the fact that no incidents or public disorders developed during the funeral . The M-19 leaders had asked the people to remain calm . The new Colombian presidential candidate is the sixth commander M-19 has had, the second since the Rebel group entered its new phase to become a political party . Antonio Navarro Wolff will be running against 12 other candidates in the elections scheduled for 27 May."
1249,DEV-MUC3-1250,BUENOS AIRES,1990-04-29,"Everybody is praising and justifying the Argentine Condor II project--the only one we had--now that it has officially died, however, a more technical description of the defunct project will reveal the gap left by our flimsy space project . According to the type of fuel used, missiles are classified as solid, liquid, and Cryogenic-Fueled missiles . The solid-fueled missiles carry their fuel and the Comburent on a sticky rod, the combustion of which cannot be regulated . The cake burns completely once the combustion starts . Therefore, solid-fueled missiles are difficult to control although they are much simpler and cheaper . Moreover, they put up with rough handling and can be easily fired . The military prefer this type for manufacturing short-range missiles . The Liquid-Fueled missiles carry the fuel and the Comburent in completely separate tanks . The two elements meet in a combustion chamber where they ignite after travelling through pipes . valves make it possible to regulate the power of the engine . ground personnel are able to stop the engine and restart it in full flight, in short, to control the missile as they wish through radio messages . The Cryogenic-Fueled missiles were developed during the 70's and 80's . They carry hydrogen and liquid gas which are lighter than any other Propellant element but which are very expensive to Refrigerate and to isolate . This technology makes it possible to build very fast vehicles because of their power to weight ratio . They are used to place huge communication satellites in space some 36,000 km above the equator, or to attack a city from the other side of the world . Liquid-Fueled missiles represent the technology developed during the 50's and 60's and, to a certain extent, explains Soviet leadership in space research . These old, heavy, cumbersome, and unbreakable missiles do not have fragile equipment and make it possible to place cargo into outer space at a reasonable cost . on the other hand, the large family of U.S. and European Cryogenic- fueled missiles continue at an experimental stage and are unpredictable . Moreover, they are incredibly costly . too poor to even think of developing Liquid-Fueled missiles, Brazil and Argentina have tried to place solid-fueled vehicles into orbit for decades . This is not all that easy because these missiles are really little more than flying rods, but the castor, which was developed by Argentina in 1978, the Sonda IV developed by Brazil, and the Japanese launching devices developed by Isas have proved to be reasonably manageable beasts . The castor represented the phase previous to designing a spaceship and this must be the reason why it mysteriously died in 1978 after a series of incredibly successful tests and after having allowed us to reach an agreement for a``joint-venture""with the Frg to study the atmosphere . The absence of mistakes by a debtor country may be fatal . When Argentina once again started to discreetly think about outer space, it already had enough knowledge to consider larger projects . In fact, with its one meter diameter tube, the Condor could place a 200 kg cargo in a low polar orbit of only 200 km . This project would have allowed Argentina to have one or more pairs of eyes in space so that could assess its natural resources, predict the water flow of rivers on which hydroelectric dams could be built, determine where it could find oil and uranium, and cheaply stop illegal fishing on the Continental platform . This possibility could not be accepted by some people . Brazil, which is less hard up, is about to progress from the Sonda IV to the Sonda V and has openly invited us to jointly develop the spaceship . What will Argentina answer?``We will""? or will it have a Chauvinist attitude? What a pity it did not adopt that attitude now that it is letting the Condor project die in its first stage--it was never tested--when the pressure is not as great as it has been . worst of it all is that it is not receiving anything in exchange . very well then, it is accepted, the Condor will go no further . What is left? very little . should we develop satellites exclusively for space research to discover the secrets of the sun, or study the cosmic explosions of X-rays . These issues, if unaffected by economic and political factors, do not disturb anybody . The NASA is quite willing to give us room, free of charge, on their rockets for this type of satellites . There is no possibility that we will gain either money or space sovereignty . There is no need to point out that any similarity between this possibility and an independent space research program, such as Brazil's, is mere coincidence . in the 80's Argentina allowed its nuclear program, which at that time was the most advanced in the third world, to be hindered . Now it is allowing its wings to be clipped and, with a stupid smile, is yielding every attempt to achieve sovereignty in space . Each attempt to develop technology is labelled arms escalation by those champions of peace, our creditors . It is quite true, the Condor II may be a missile, as a cargo aircraft may drop bombs and a truck may be equipped with artillery for war . does this mean that Argentina must stop manufacturing all type of vehicles? this question is not pointless in a country that refuses to make any progress."

But the U.S. House of Representatives has voted to cut military aid in half and U.S. Secretary of state James Baker has warned that aid to El Salvador will depend on progress in the priests' case .

The Farabundo Marti National liberation front, meanwhile, also said its attacks in San Salvador early Wednesday were to protest the lack of progress in prosecuting members of the military for the massacre of the priests .

The officers NOTE the diplomat's position regarding the case of the Jesuit priests; how he failed to denounce a Colonel who accidentally discovered the culprits and how, lately, he has warned the high command about some information that was going to be made public by a U.S. network . The letter, which was released during the last few hours and is dated 1 may, expresses the young Army officers support for Colonel Sigifredo Ochoa Perez, after the defense Ministry, with the blessing of several commanders, decided to take the current president of Cel to task publicly . in their letter, the officers state that they agree completely with the former military commander regarding which senior officers give orders to Junior officers . We are obedient and Nonconfrontational and that is why we continue to obey orders from superiors, but this must stop when the violation of principles and rights are involved, says the call from the young officers to the President and high command .

The document asks how some former officers are able to live so well when we know they graduated from our military alma mater . the case of the Jesuit priests is also examined in their letter . They note that the identity of the culprits became known shortly after the murder, but some of the senior officers withheld important information from the President of the Republic and armed forces commander in chief . a few hours after the murder, many of us suspected what had happened . We, the young officers, have the best sources of information and many of us did not think that the case would have any major impact because the activism of the priests with the Farabundo Marti national front was well-known . However, there was cause for concern almost immediately after the crime became known . The priests' murder was described as irrational and senseless because open fighting against terrorism is one thing and the struggle against the Ideologists is another . The Attorney General of the Republic made up the story about the Fmln hatching a plot to murder the San Salvador bishops in an attempt to distract attention from the killing of the priests, the letter says . The Attorney General could not be reached for comment about this . As stated by the young officers, when the Attorney General's idea was raised, it was pointed out that it would not be credible . This was treated as a childish and illogical way out . The gross lie made up by the Attorney General was never considered a practical option, the document says . The self-styled Domingo Monterrosa lives movement has sent the letter to President Alfredo Cristiani, the Assembly, and the armed forces high command, asking them to measure the consequences of the position assumed by the U.S. embassy and various sectors of the country regarding military aid .

First, I think it would be a negative signal for the Fmln and for the objective of trying to find an end to the conflict through the dialogue process that has been started; and that a cut in aid might be analyzed by some of the members, or all the members of the Fmln, as meaning a weakening of the government and its defense and that, therefore, their military victory is now closer . and it would make it a lot more difficult to end the conflict in a short while through a political dialogue . Second, obviously the government has the responsibility to defend the institutions, the democratic institutions of the country, and will not standby with a weakened defense . Therefore, this means Reallocating resources that might be used for other types of programs--social programs, economic or political programs--... for defense purposes .""returning the Jesuits murder case, Cristiani is asked if the military high command is being investigated . He says:``first of all I would say that the high command--and this is just my own point of view--was instrumental in making it possible to carry out the investigation . The high command made it possible for the investigation to be within the armed forces, an investigation that has no precedent in the past with respect to investigating military units .... it would be very difficult to believe that by supporting the investigation and opening up the armed forces so that they can be investigated in this case, they would have done so if there were some involvement on their part .""further as available."
1262,DEV-MUC3-1263,SAN SALVADOR,1990-05-03,"Juan Amadeo Cabrera from La Noticia . Mr. President, if the communique issued by the young military officers is true, if it is true that they are members of the armed forces, what is the outlook for the armed forces and for your government? I believe some speculation would be required . I believe that as an anonymous letter, it cannot be given the credit it deserves, if it was written by someone who is completely responsible . In this regard, I repeat that the armed forces have been willing to conduct a process of Professionalizing and modernizing . They are trying to improve their institution as much as possible . Luisa Melgar from Teleprensa . Mr. President, yesterday the Fmln carried out different armed actions in different parts of the country . A communique issued by the Fmln general command justified the actions because of alleged human rights violations, repression, and lack of security for civilians . How do you view these actions just when the talks are about to begin? I read the communique and I honestly believe that it is one of the most ridiculous Fmln communiques I have seen to date . It is a justification that is not very justifiable, I would say . I believe the events on 1 may in the morning can clearly be understood . All groups wishing to participate were able to March peacefully . their freedoms are not being repressed . I imagine you have all heard and seen what they said and did and there were no problems . I feel that this was a way to seek notoriety through the news . This could be one of the reasons . The other reason could be that they are having problems among themselves . We have information telling us that there are differences among the different groups . Some of them view the dialogue as something serious, while others do not, and it could be that these problems are resulting in these irrational adventures by the Fmln . I feel that at this stage of the dialogue process, their actions are completely unjustifiable . that is not all . They have even violated what they have called unilateral gestures made in the past . This shows the lack of seriousness and sincerity in all of them, or some of them, concerning the objectives we are trying to achieve with the dialogue process . Guillermo Penate from El Diario de Hoy . There are some labor groups that want to be included in the delegation that will participate in the talks with the Fmln . could this not be some sort of disadvantage for the official delegation, because the opposite groups could gain strength? I think that is true . Some groups have asked to be included in the delegation . I believe the participation of the different groups is stipulated in the Geneva agreements . We have already explained how the government can allow for the participation of political and social sectors of the country . We are not going to change the government Commission, which is comprised of government officials for the most part . I believe that the participation of members of social organizations has already been explained in the past . Raul Beltran from radio Cadena Yskl . Mr. President, over the past few hours we have learned about the official statement issued by the commanders of the various Garrisons and the high command . Since you are the Commander in chief of the armed forces, do you support the document that was published, which condemned the statements made by Col. Sigifredo Ochoa Perez? concerning that situation, I have said that several people have made statements, not just one . There has been public speculation as to what may have happened in the assassinations of the Jesuit priests and the other two people and that is not right . If someone has any information to contribute, and if that someone is really interested in the progress of justice in this country, he should go to the judge to give him the information . He should not continue to speculate in public, because it confuses people and it Obstructs the judicial process . I would like to mention, for example, that not long ago a delegation of Spanish legal experts visited the country and they were pleased to see how the 4TH criminal judge was handling the judicial process, as opposed to other reports that have been released in the United States . However, I believe that no one should speculate in public as to what may have happened . If someone has information or evidence, he should go to the judge, otherwise there will be confusion . in that regard, I believe that the armed forces commanders' rejection of Col. Ochoa's statements is just that . In many of the statements they wrote--I did not participate in drafting the statement--they mentioned that they are willing to support and strengthen the judicial process, but they cannot come out in public with speculation because they would only confuse people."
1263,DEV-MUC3-1264,SAN SALVADOR,1990-05-03,"However, the Fmln idea that they have to show force here, or there, or somewhere is not logical . The important point is that the Salvadoran people want to live in peace and tranquility . Therefore, it makes no difference that they may have 1,000 , 2,000, or 100 . that does not matter . I think that, whether they have a high or a low morale or whatever, with just 100 radicals they could kill people and destroy sources of employment . In sum, they cause panic and terror in some Hamlets . I believe that has to be stopped . It is not a matter of who shows force and who does not . regardless of the demonstrations of force the Fmln may carry out, we still believe that, in the long run, the military victory by the government forces and the government is possible, because they have a strong moral support . The government has been elected by the people and has the support of the Salvadoran people . The people support the system and the government, no matter who is heading it, not just a particular individual . However, that is not the point . We do not want this conflict to last 10 years longer, with more bloodshed . Therefore, we are searching for a political solution because we believe in it, not because it suits us because they are stronger or not stronger . James Lohman . Mr. President, with the reduction in the U.S. government's military aid, has your government considered the possibility of seeking military aid in other countries on this continent or from other parts of the world? for example, we know that a country like Israel has given military aid to central American countries . have you considered that possibility? I can only tell you that, yes, certainly, the government of the Republic has the duty of defending the system and the Salvadoran democratic institutions, and--regardless of what may happen, and we hope that will not occur--if that happens, we will always have to seek alternate resources for the defense of the country's democratic institutions . a few days ago I listened to statements by some politicians and members of other sectors, who complained because I said: We have the responsibility of defending the democratic institutions, we have to find the resources, and there are other alternatives to get resources for the national defense . Those politicians said it would be disastrous to affect social programs to help the needy . that is actually what those politicians should think about when they ask for a reduction in aid . I believe that is something the government cannot neglect . The government must defend the system from possible attacks--through violence to reach power--which has been termed by central American Presidents and by many countries throughout the world as illegal . have you considered all I can tell you is that we are taking into consideration some alternatives . However, we are not going to leave the country's democratic institutions defenseless . We will now have questions in English . Tom Gibbs from the BBC . What would be the effect of cutting U.S. military aid? and also it seems that the Democrats in Congress put as a high priority for the continuation of aid the Jesuits' case, and also the cleaning up of the officers Corps of the Army, or changes in the military . How inconvenient would it be to your government, or how it would be to your government to be able to? well, I think that, first of all, the effect of the reduction or cut of aid would be twofold . on the first hand, I think it would be a negative signal for the Fmln and for the objective of trying to find an end to the conflict through the dialogue process that has been started, and that a cut in aid might be analyzed by some of the members, or all the members of the Fmln, as meaning a weakening of the government and its defense and that, therefore, their military victory is now closer . and it would make it a lot more difficult to end the conflict in a short while through a political dialogue . Secondly, obviously the government has the responsibility to defend the institutions, the democratic institutions of the country, and will not stand by with a weakened defense . Therefore, this means Reallocating resources that might be used for other types of programs--social programs, economic, or political programs that the government can have access to, and obviously to Reallocate resources for defense purposes . Thus, it would have a twofold impact if that was the case . on the other hand, I think that the judicial process in the case of the Jesuit priests is ongoing . It will be difficult for me to think that before it has ended, that there is Prejudgement on what the results would be . I think that the judge, as I said earlier, has received at least the visits of many people . Just recently a group of lawyers from Spain came in and analyzed the case, and were very pleased with the way the judge was handling the case, according, obviously, to Salvadoran law."
1264,DEV-MUC3-1265,SAN SALVADOR,1990-05-03,"Commander Jorge Melendez, a top Salvadoran guerrilla leader, admitted on Thursday to a change in the U.S. policy toward this country and said that the George Bush administration now``favors""a negotiated political solution to the war .

1265,DEV-MUC3-1266,SAN SALVADOR,1990-05-04,"The military high command emphatically rejects the Junior officer's statements, considered a type of gray Propoganda, because no person or group of persons has claimed responsibility for them . The statements are Biased in favor of the Farabundo Marti National liberation front . On 10 January 1981 a series of similarly anonymous letters and statements were circulated . The military intelligence learned that the letters were part of a strategy implemented by former captain Francisco Sandoval, along with other members of the Salvadoran subversion . In addition, something similar happened in November 1989, but this time it was done by a High-Ranking member of the National Union of Salvadoran workers, who claimed that he had received a communique from Junior officers on a number of irregularities that were reportedly occurring within the armed forces . The Fmln terrorist groups launched offensives on both occasions . According to their goals, the final task was to seize power by force and by all means, even if they had to sacrifice the lives of many Salvadoran civilians and severely damage houses and the country's economic infrastructure . The Armed Forces are aware of their high level of professionalism and their own institutional ethics and philosophy as demanded by the Constitution of the Republic and reiterate that their mission will always be to defend the nation's sovereignty and to protect each and every one of the Salvadoran people's life and interests . Therefore, it is useless to try to undermine the armed forces' morale and to confuse and divide all the members comprising the armed forces through groundless communiques which are intended to create false expectations for the national and international public."
1266,DEV-MUC3-1267,SAN SALVADOR,,"I have another question . a few moments ago, president Cristiani termed the most ridiculous communique he had ever heard from the Fmln the one in which they justified yesterday's military actions . He termed them Propaganda-Oriented . within the framework of the negotiations, how do you view this? in my opinion, the Fmln communique has aspects that are interesting and others which I think are not valid . the time and opportunity of that action is ambivalent . I think it has negative effects, as well as positive effects for them . There is always the famous vicious circle wherein if the Fmln ceases to act militarily, it is bad for the Fmln because it shows a sign of weakness . If it acts militarily it is also bad, because it shows that it does not want peace . In this sense, I think there is no doubt that it has exhibited a show of force, that its actions have been strictly Propaganda-Oriented or with propaganda objectives . It does not cease to create difficult conditions that generate a negative reaction on the other's part, if they want to sit down and try to ease confrontations as much as possible and seek an agreement as much as possible . I believe, as I told President Cristiani on the telephone yesterday when we spoke of other things but touched on this topic, that I uphold the government's thesis . We have always criticized the fact that when negative things occur, they are invoked to suspend a process which in our opinion should be continuous . We have always upheld the continuity of the dialogue . The government criticized the Fmln when on two occasions it suspended the dialogue due to terrorist actions on the part of the government or security Corps . The dialogue and negotiation process has suffered as a result of this . I believe that in this case the government should take its own medicine . It should maintain the continuity of the process and not use as a pretext the Fmln military actions to try to seek ways of conditioning or Perturbing a process of dialogue and negotiation, which involves not only the government and the Fmln, but the political parties and social forces as well . Dr. Ungo, in that sense the government had announced through President Cristiani that the dialogue would be resumed on 3 May . subsequently, the UN Secretary General's envoy announced that it would be the first part of May . don't you think that too much time is being spent without being able to agree on summit meetings that will permit securing agreements? I have a very positive analysis of how the process is developing in this first phase, judging by the conduct on the part of the government and the Fmln . I think there has been a delay, but I think it is a delay that improves the possibilities and conditions . Apparently the times were marked by haste and precipitation for the Fmln to present a proposal . Also, there was a very short time for the government to prepare its response and hold a bilateral meeting later . at the same time, it left a very narrow margin of influence to the political parties and social organizations . President Cristiani himself convened the political parties to explain to them what the situation was and how he viewed the role of the parties . The parties have their own concept of their role and have been working Arduously and responsibly . in two weeks they held four prolonged, high-level meetings, two per week . We want to do the same thing with the Fmln . I believe that the period of two to three weeks to one month, since the Geneva agreement was signed, has been positive . If we had hurried things up, perhaps the possibility of achieving results would have been affected . What happens is that all of this gives way to somewhat pessimistic evaluations, because the confidentiality was violated by President Cristiani . I have been told that these things are part of a private, confidential Aide-Memoire that was agreed to in Geneva between the two top leaders of the Fmln and the government delegation with UN Secretary General Perez de Cuellar's representative."

They will have to return at some point when they conclude their studies in the United States .

If the judge deems their presence advisable, they may be called immediately . referring to the entry and departure Registry of the day when the Jesuits were killed, how will this situation end up? so far, I cannot comment on the matter . I am not aware of the situation . We have to see what happened . Gen. Larios feels that the Jesuits' case has had a great bearing on the conditions placed on the military aid the U.S. Senate will approve . The military chief regretted it is not up to the Salvadoran Army to say when the aid must be cut . The U.S . lawmakers have their means and criteria to decide when to cut aid, he said referring to the decision by the U.S. government . The U.S. administration has said it will cut military aid by 50 percent if the Salvadoran government does not try the persons guilty of murdering six Jesuits and two others . The aid will be cut if the Cristiani government does not try to obtain specific agreements in the negotiations with the guerrillas . We all know what will happen regarding the military aid . Unfortunately, we must admit we cannot decide the terms under which we will receive that military aid . They must do that . They will decide when and by how much that aid will be cut . General, do you think that the 60 minutes program in which Col.Ochoa Perez participated was influential in the decision to ask the the U.S. House of Representatives to cut the aid? I think that it has definitely been influential . We must undoubtedly recognize this . Nevertheless, that is not all . I believe that the situation existed even before the 60 minutes program was broadcast . Therefore, I believe that the problem existed regardless of what was said during the 60 minutes program, and we were . What were the issues which had already determined this? What could they be? that is really nothing new . The Jesuits' case has been, let us say, the decisive factor for deciding one thing or another in the U.S. Congress, Senate, and administration about the military aid . that is basically the issue . Gen. Larios also talked about possible changes which might occur in the Army leadership . recent rumors indicate that he might leave his post as defense Minister, and that changes might occur within the armed forces high command . He said that he does not rule out the possibility that these changes may occur, but he termed them as routine . referring to a U.S. television program which implied Colonel Orlando Zepeda's participation in the Jesuits' case, the defense minister said he does not believe this type of information because the deputy defense Minister is a colleague who only handles administrative issues within the Army."

On 7 April Federal police of Mato Grosso do Sul state raided a well-equipped cocaine refining laboratory on a ranch in Aquidauana, the Rio de Janeiro daily O Globo of 8 April reports . The lab was the fifth uncovered in the state in the last 14 months . agents seized 50 kilos of processed cocaine, one of the largest seizures in Brazil this year, and more than 100 liters of ether and acetone . twenty heavily armed traffickers were arrested . With inadequate police strength and bordering both Bolivia and Paraguay, the state is considered one of the main routes for the drug rings that supply cocaine to Brazil's principal urban centers, particularly Rio and Sao Paulo . The traffickers also have connections abroad . The laboratory in Aquidauana was discovered as a result of the recent arrest of eight civilian police detectives, two Federal policemen, and four highway policemen involved in a narcotics ring, continues O Globo . During questioning, they provided information that led to the other members of the ring, including a Bolivian chemist in Aquidauana . The ring was headed by a Mato Grosso do Sul businessman and a politician who financed the trafficking activities and provided cover; neither man was identified by name in the report . According to Federal agents, the cocaine paste was brought from Bolivia by fishermen and Canoers hired on the Brazilian- Bolivian border, and was processed and distributed in Aquidauana . O Globo terms the raid a``real clean-up""in the civilian, military, and Federal police departments . The first such action was taken in late 1989 when Federal police arrested 22 policemen . O Globo of 2 April cites the arrest of six military policemen caught in the Act of distributing cocaine in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul state, adding that the ring included more than 20 military policemen . The Ringleader was Oldiney Freire, an attorney arrested in March 1989 and a close associate of rancher Cambaralamaia de Sousa . Prior to his arrest in June 1988, Cambaralamaia controlled cocaine trafficking in a large portion of Mato Grosso using the Cochabamba, Bolivia route . He also supplied 300 kilos of pure cocaine monthly to Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Espirito Santo . Rio de Janeiro daily Jornal do Brasil notes on 17 April that the Federal police Department is investigating charges that Federal police are involved in drug smuggling and trafficking in Corumba and Ladario . trafficking in the region has increased steadily in recent years due to the proximity to Bolivian towns included in the route used by international trafficking rings, according to the paper . acknowledging that there have been serious problems with the Federal police in Mato Grosso do Sul, Dpf legal coordinator Mario Cassiano Dutra said that in February alone, four investigations were opened into charges of police involvement in drug and arms trafficking and bribery, an additional 12 were currently in progress, and another five only needed documents in order to be concluded . to combat the growing narcotics problem in the state capital of Corumba, on 11 April local station radio Clube de Corumba launched an antidrug campaign . It devoted an hour of its regular program``public debate""to an expose of drug distribution points in the city and the complicity of Federal police, military police, and civilian police investigators with narcotraffickers . According to O Globo of 12 April, program moderator Armando Amorim Anache identified 21 cocaine distribution points as well as policemen and the traffickers who supplied them in exchange for protection . after the program, Anache received four threatening phone calls, including a bomb threat against the building housing the radio station, O Globo of 14 April reports . He received widespread public support when he broadcast those threats . radio Clube received letters alerting police to the use of children who pick up drugs from Bolivian women at the railroad station . A mothers' protest parade was planned, and 850 local businessmen resolved to close their doors for one day as a symbolic protest against the trafficking situation in Corumba . On 18 April, the station received six bomb threats from cocaine traffickers who also threatened to bomb its sister station radio Independente de Aquidauana, O Globo of 19 April reports . wearing a yellow T-shirt with the slogan``drugs: out of here ,""President Fernando Collor de Mello launched an antidrug campaign, O Estado de Sao Paulo of 29 April reported in a front-page photo with accompanying Inside-Page article . Collor then donated the T-shirt to the Federal police for an auction to raise funds for equipment, particularly for monitoring the border areas . The mothers of Corumba are conducting that auction, in which the minimum bid will be 100,000 Cruzeiros . Collor is seeking the participation of the entire society . He is not interested in just a health Ministry sponsored program, O Estado reports."

The measure especially affects Antonio Navarro Wolff, candidate of the former 19 April guerrilla movement, who replaced Carlos Pizarro Leon-Gomez, who was assassinated last month while he was aboard a flight, as M-19 presidential candidate . The Supreme Court, which has pronounced itself on the decrees and laws promulgated by the legislative and executive branches, declared unconstitutional a decree issued by the government of President Virgilio Barco Vargas which eliminated the qualifications for persons to register as Presidential Canddidates . The decree was issued under the state of siege that has existed for the past six years . The government decree was issued to favor Pizarro Leon-Gomez, who entered the Presidential race after a peace process whereby the M-19 Demobilized and abandoned the armed struggle . also affected are candidates Guillermo Aleman, popular singer and Cumbia composer Mario Garena, Jairo Rodriguez Leon, and Henry Farfan Silva, who had already resigned, although none of them had any chance of winning . According to the Supreme Court, the state of siege must only be considered when issuing decrees dealing with the restoring of public order, which does not contemplate Presidential elections . The Colombian laws demand that a presidential candidate must be or has been a parliamentarian, university professor, Ambassador, or Attorney General, and has been a professional for at least five years . Nonetheless, the Supreme Court's decision is not retroactive and the candidacies will be withdrawn only if they are officially challenged."

In this regard, the Peruvian Embassy REITERATES that, through NOTE No.5-20-M/002 dated 8 January 1990, it notified the Panamanian foreign Ministry that diplomatic Asylum had been granted to 12 persons who came to this mission's residence, including former defense forces major Gonzalo Gonzalez Rivera, and requested that Safe-Conducts be granted for them to travel abroad . We might stress that such granting of Asylum and requesting Safe-Conducts, as was indicated in this Embassy's NOTE No.5-20-/M-027 dated 2 March 1990, was based on the qualification granted to this embassy as the state granting the Asylum according to the convention on diplomatic Asylum signed in Caracas in March 1954 . Therefore, the Peruvian government cannot take into consideration any actions of which the refugee may be accused, or any legal situation that may prevail after the subject has been granted Asylum . However, and without going against what has been previously stated, the refugee Gonzalo Gonzalez is willing to render testimony before an authorized legal official so as to clarify his situation . The Peruvian Embassy will allow that official to enter the premises of the embassy for this purpose . at this time, the Peruvian embassy, based on the clear dispositions of the Caracas convention on diplomatic Asylum--the international agreement in effect between Panama and Peru--REITERATES once again the request for a safe-conduct for the aforementioned refugee . The Peruvian Embassy Avails itself of this opportunity to reaffirm its highest and most distinguished consideration to the honorable foreign Ministry . Panama , 7 may 1990"

According to persons who were nearby at that time, shooting was heard before the explosions . a few minutes later, devices, believed to be fragmentation grenades, went off . The shock wave created by the blast shattered the windows of House number 729 and building 626, located in front of the vacant lot .

1286,DEV-MUC3-1287,TEL AVIV ,1990-05-17,"When he began his job as Guatemalan President after decades of military regimes that left behind 100,000 fatalities, Christian Democrat Marco Vinicio Arevalo Cerezo had promises for the future and things to his credit in the past . The things to his credit were four assassination attempts on him because of his attempts to restore democracy in his country, and his promises were to stop political violence, corruption, and mainly the activities of the extreme right-wing death squads . Cerezo has been in this post for five years . New elections are to be held soon, and the activities of the death squads, supported by elements in the defense forces, have not stopped . They killed hundreds of labor union leaders and leftists . The visit to Israel by Guatemalan foreign minister Ariel Irias Rivera provides an opportunity to understand what is happening in his country . After all, no one at the foreign ministry has expressed an interest in it . before you came here, you said that you intend to make a contribution here from your experience in bringing peace to Central America . What can the Middle East learn from Central America? you can learn that problems can be solved without violence, that international assistance and guarantees are important . It seems to us that the proposition to hold an international conference is the one that eventually will bring peace to your area . at the same time, we are aware of the large differences between the situation in our region, where all the peoples have the same origin, and yours, where national, community, and religious conflicts are intertwined . It was said in Jerusalem that you have not come here to purchase military equipment . that sort of clarification does not usually precede a visit by a foreign minister to Israel . It is possible that they wanted to clarify an issue that is self-evident for us . with us, weapon deals are carried out by military personnel . The Israeli chapter of amnesty International wanted to present you with a petition signed by hundreds of Israelis demanding that human rights' abuse in Guatemala in the past several years be investigated . I have a deep respect for amnesty International, but we feel it is outdated to use tools from a dictatorial past on present regimes . It is well known that Cerezo's government has a policy that is different from its predecessors' . Nevertheless, there still are centers of right-wing power in our country; those groups fear the stabilization of democracy . Cerezo promised to investigate Israeli involvement in Guatemala, including arms and defense technology sales . has anything been done in that respect? from what I know, Israel sold weapons to Guatemala at the full price when the U.S . boycott was in effect and our Army needed military equipment to fight the guerrillas . other than that, our decision is not to scratch the wounds of the past, but to worry about peace in the future . Cerezo's government appears to be one with good intentions, but without complete control over the Army and those connected with the death squads . This is an incorrect image . I would not say that it is easy to overcome all the power elements in a few years . Still, I can say that progress is being made in this field . The Army's command headed by General Gramajo Morales, the defense Minister, greatly assisted the process of democratization . are the elements that took part in the coups not connected to the extreme right-wing and the death squads which murdered hundreds of citizens in the past few years, under a Democratic regime? it is very probable, but we must remember that these elements are a minority, after all . The officers who were involved in the first coup were pardoned . The officers who participated in the second coup were brought to trial . I believe this indicates a positive development . in your opinion, will Cerezo be able to appear before the voters in a few months and prove that he has kept his promises? to a large extent, yes . economic growth has begun; political and professional organizations allowed; political leaders are no longer systematically murdered as in the past; and there is no violent suppression of democratic expressions . Cerezo is trying to play the Democratic game all the way."
1287,DEV-MUC3-1288,MANILA ,1990-05-18,"The unholy Union of illicit drug traffickers and political terrorists has become evident in the Philippines as in other countries such as Peru and Colombia, military authorities said yesterday . violence fueled by big drug profits is viewed as a major threat to a number of sovereign governments, they added . Last March, authorities in Manila arrested two new people's Army guerrillas reportedly from the Alex Boncayao Brigade for trafficking in narcotics . The arrests came after a Four-Month investigation of reports that the Communist party of the Philippines was involved in drug trafficking as a means to shore up resources for buying firearms in view of declining donations from supporters in Europe . forty-four decks of Shabu with a street value of P154,000 were found in the possession of the suspects . in the same month, drug kingpin Jose Oyson, also known as don Pepe, was killed while grappling with police as he was being taken to the National Bureau of investigation headquarters for questioning . After his acquittal for the 1984 killing of an anti-drug crusading Manila newspaper reporter, Oyson allegedly established connections with major drug syndicate leaders in Hong Kong and Taiwan . He also had been under suspicion of financing right-wing revolts against President Aquino . The arrests of the two Npa guerrillas provided the first hard evidence in the Philippines of the unholy alliance of narcotics trafficking and terrorism that had already plagued a number of governments elsewhere . authorities said they also showed that illicit drug profits can fuel revolutions from the right or the left with equal magnanimity and even simultaneously . as a prime example, in Colombia, powerful cocaine leaders who worked in close league with Communist insurgents 10 or 15 years ago have turned against the insurgents as their staggering drug profits enabled them to buy up huge tracts of rural farm and ranch land and urban real estate in the 1980s"

The small plane suffered the accident while flying the President, his wife, and a delegation that included high- ranking Army officers from Quito to Loja province . all of them died . The relatives of the late President expressed doubts that the plane crashed accidentally and filed charges as private citizens, but the case was later closed . doubts have been expressed several times about the alleged accident, and the case resurfaced again when a new investigation was opened and one of the witnesses disclosed that there is evidence of participation by the U.S. CIA in the death of Roldos and his retinue . Ernesto Buenano, Roldos' political adviser, asserted before a multiparty Commission of the Ecuadoran Congress that the plane accident in which the former President died did not result from human error or technical failure but from sabotage, which consisted of contaminating the plane's fuel to cause its engines to stall . The witness pointed out that there is incontestable evidence about this and urged the Commission to investigate the persons who were responsible for supplying fuel to the President's plane . It is worth mentioning that Roldos' administration was characterized by a progressive orientation, and more specifically by his direct opposition to U.S . attempts to dominate the Latin American countries . The former President was openly in solidarity with the Sandinist National liberation front of Nicaragua and the Salvadoran insurgents . His adoption of this stance led U.S . imperialism to consider the Roldos doctrine as a danger to its interests . When one recalls the position of the former Ecuadoran President, the disappearance of former Panamanian leader Omar Torrijos Herrera also comes to mind . Torrijos' death was similar in circumstances to that of Jaime Roldos, and his patriotic attitude with regard to his country's sovereignty was also similar . Torrijos and Roldos were a nuisance to U.S. plans in Latin America and both were murdered, as various sources have disclosed . former Chilean President Salvador Allende it cannot be said that the CIA's hand directly took his life, the organization did help destabilize his progressive government . The investigations on Jaime Roldos' death and what was said at the time about the alleged accident suffered by Omar Torrijos reveal once more the sinister plans of the U.S. CIA against our Latin American and Caribbean people, who must remain on the alert."

The civilian who was killed has been identified as Jose Ovidio Gomez, a taxi driver, and the injured policeman is Ricardo Antonio Martinez .

The source attributed the attack to urban guerrilla Commandos, but the guerrillas have not claimed credit for it . This is the first attack that has taken place in the Salvadoran capital since the peace negotiations between the government and the Farabundo Marti National liberation front began last Wednesday in Venezuela . The talks are in their sixth day today and there is an atmosphere of optimism .

1296,DEV-MUC3-1297,SANTIAGO,1990-05-21,"Chilean President Patricio Aylwin will today report on the first 70 days of his administration and will make important announcements concerning his future plans in a speech to a plenary meeting of the Chilean Congress that will mark the beginning of special congressional sessions . Aylwin's speech awakens considerable expectation because of recent Unpublicized clashes between Aylwin's administration and general August Pinochet, who has been throwing his weight around as Commander in chief of the Army, and also because of the growing Rightwing opposition to the actions of the Democratic administration . political analysts have pointed out that the Presidential speech will coincide with the``end of a Government-Opposition honeymoon""that had marked the initial weeks of the new administration . The administration's initiatives regarding human rights, tax reform, the democratization of local governments, and other steps aimed at depriving military courts of their powers have worsened the conflict and have made things more difficult for Aylwin's administration . This is happening because, while the Rightwing parties are leaning more and more toward Pinochet every day and longing for his authoritarian regime, the Leftwing parties and even sectors of the coalition of parties for democracy have been criticizing Aylwin for alleged``lukewarm""approach to the implementation of the democratic changes that he promised during his electoral campaign . The Rightwing has taken due advantage of several unsolved terrorist attacks over the recent weeks to prop up its opposition in Congress to bills related to human rights . However, according to recent opinion polls, Aylwin will make his speech amid growing popularity, much higher than the support he obtained at the 14 December elections . The Presidential speech to Congress at the legislative Palace in Valparaiso , 125 km West of Santiago, will mark the return to a Long-Standing Democratic tradition that Chileans used to enjoy every 21 May . on this day, the report to Congress was yet another reason for popular rejoicing because it coincided with the``naval glories day""which is also commemorated on 21 may in memory of the Chile's top naval hero Arturo PRAT who died in the naval battle of Iquique during the 1879 Pacific war . Since Congress was closed down during the military regime, General Augusto Pinochet used to read his state of the nation address on 11 September, the anniversary of the military coup d'etat through which he seized power . According to political analysts, Aylwin's speech may provide the key to the layout of Chile's transition in the future . The manner in which the President will make his report is rather curious because theoretically this report should encompass one year of government, while Aylwin has been president for only 70 days during which the administration has been harshly criticized by the Rightwing every time the administration had something bad to say about the prior military regime . General Pinochet personally told Aylwin that he felt offended by Aylwin's labor day celebration speech on 1 May . During his latest private meeting with the President, Pinochet told Aylwin that he felt that the``truth and reconciliation""Commission that Aylwin had created to investigate human rights violations during the military regime was a direct attack on the Army . Pinochet also told Aylwin that by way of``protest""against these actions he would not attend the luncheon to which the President had invited all the commanders of the armed forces branches . According to leaks about this meeting, Aylwin told Pinochet:``watch your step, general""and reminded him that offensive behavior against the President could harm Pinochet's image even within his own institution, the Army . Pinochet did not attend the luncheon, however, sending instead general Hugo Salas, the third Highest-Ranking Army officer and the former chief of the CNI, the secret police of his regime . Pinochet failed in his attempt to Convoke the national security Council and to make this Council issue a statement against the``truth and reconciliation""Commission, but Pinochet's sortie in the political arena awoke concern laced with fear, as one government official admitted to Efe . The source, who asked to remain anonymous, added that``Pinochet is aware of the fear he awakens and he uses it Adroitly .""the former President will not attend the today's ceremony in Congress although the commanders of the other armed forces branches, the very same ones that did not support his attempt to Convoke the national security Council, will be present . Pinochet claimed that he has``institutional reasons""for his absence and has left for northern Chile where he is currently touring Army Garrisons . Analysts believe that the``Pinochet effect""will be noticeable in Aylwin's speech through greater moderation in announcements of new institutional changes and through more benign assessments of the previous military regime."
1297,DEV-MUC3-1298,SAN SALVADOR,1990-05-21,"The Farabundo Marti National liberation front informs the Salvadoran people and international community : 1 . simultaneously with the initiation of the Caracas meeting on 16 may, the armed forces launched a general offensive with aerial bombings, massive artillery attacks, and the deployment of paratroopers and infantry soldiers to all our rural fronts . following five days of intense combat, we have confirmed that it is a routine operation and not a large-scale offensive . 2 . Our forces have rejected the enemy's general offensive and to date have downed one helicopter, damaged two others, and inflicted dozens of casualties on the enemy troops . We deny that commander Leoncio Pichinte was killed in combat . 3 . While the government accuses the Fmln of having violated the confidentiality of the talks, Cristiani and the process have been making a series of statements concerning confidential issues . 4 . from the signing of the Geneva agreement, the government has increased its interference of our radio Venceremos and radio Farabundo Marti, which reflects the government's weakness . It cannot stand to have our positions known . Therefore, there is clearly no freedom of expression, which in turn delays the possibility of a cease-fire because it hinders the National debate we need in order to reach a political solution . 5 . from the above situation, we conclude that the government has used the Caracas meeting as part of a war plan, with Cristiani participating at the psychological warfare level with a view to pointing out the Contradictoriness of the Fmln's political activity . with the negotiation and the interference of our radio stations, the Fmln has silenced the confidentiality argument, while the Army is trying to militarily annihilate us and is openly proclaiming it by saying that it has attacked command posts and killed Fmln leaders . 6 . The Fmln REITERATES that as long as a cease-fire is not agreed upon through a political agreement that will end the Army's impunity, and specific pledges are not made to Demilitarize the country, it reserves the legitimate right to defend itself even by launching offensives, regardless of their scope, whenever necessary anywhere within the National territory."

I want to tell all the victims' relatives and friends that we share their sorrow and sadness . the country and Antioquia Department have been dealt a strong blow today .

He is to be added to the list of Martyrs that have been murdered for their thoughts and brave attitude in confronting the country's problems . Federico Estrada was a fighter in this Administartion and, as our Colombian ambassador to Italy, contributed to the improvement of relations with that country and with the European Community . the country recalls him for his recent actions as the proponent and promoter of the constitutional reforms project at the Senate . His Brillant political and professional career allowed him to reach the highest positions of the Colombian Congress and of the judicial branch . He was a Supreme Court magistrate, university professor, parliamentarian, the national and departmental leader of the liberal party, a public servant of many years, and a tireless worker for the wellbeing of the people of Antioqua . his life was ended at a time when the country and his party needed his experience and knowledge . to his wife, his four children, his followers, and all Antioqueans, I send a heartfelt message of Condolence in the name of all his fellow countrymen . The people are sick of this irrational violence . All COLOMBIANS get angry each time a barbaric act takes place and each time one of our leaders is murdered .

This is what the government has been doing; it has supported them morally and materially . to defeat terrorism and impunity depends above all on the cooperation of citizens . We must all become like soldiers in the search for peace because the future of our families, our principles, our rights, and our democracy are at stake . Let those who promote violence face an invincible army of 30 million honest COLOMBIANS . No one should take advantage of this painful moment the country is enduring . the interests of Colombia are above all other considerations . on the eve of the elections and the decision by the honorable Supreme Court of justice on the constitutional Assembly, and after a thorough analysis of the most recent public order disturbances, I have deemed it appropriate to send the foreign minister to represent Colombia at the Andean group Presidential summit . As you are aware, the Andean group Presidential summit will begin tomorrow in Cuzco, Peru . This meeting was called with the objective of achieving new progress in the integration of the Subregion, through new mechanisms for integration and with the creation of the Andean Presidential Council . The foreign minister will be entrusted with reaffirming Colombia's full commitment to the integration process and to concerted new joint actions with Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Venezuela to face the problem of the consumption, smuggling, and drug production . fellow countrymen: I hereby reiterate my deepest condolences to all those who have been affected by violence . It is at this time of sorrow and sadness when we COLOMBIANS should be more United than ever .

The surrendering of weapons in the hands of this group will be discussed at this meeting . The four-day meeting began on 18 may at the Guayas electoral tribunal . However, the meeting was continued later at an undisclosed location in Guayaquil . During their sessions, in addition to making a decision on the surrendering of weapons, AVC leaders will also assess the agreement they signed a year ago with the President Rodrigo Borja government . The accord made it possible for them to cease the armed struggle in exchange for a government dialogue with social sectors in the country . Prior to the beginning of the fourth AVC national conference, AVC leader Santiago Dillman reported on 18 may that the final decision on the surrendering of weapons was a logical step--after taking into consideration that the armed struggle in Ecuador and in the rest of Latin America is no longer the proper course . Therefore, he announced, this Alfarist meeting will also analyze the decision to organize a new political party or to allow AVC leaders to join an already existing group recognized by the Supreme electoral tribunal . These are some of the points on the agenda of the AVC meeting, which is expected to conclude on 21 or 22 may with a historical resolution . However, AVC leaders--among them Santiago Dillman, Marco Troya, Pedro Moncada, and Janeth Sosa--have preferred not to disclose the site of the meeting, which has frustrated the work of journalists . The AVC leaders plan to discuss the possibility of delivering weapons in the hands of AVC members to a Socialist International delegation in a ceremony similar to one recently held by the 19-April movement in Colombia, which in the past has staged several well-known military actions, including the kidnapping of businessman Naim Isaias with the help of the AVC . The AVC has said it wants to participate in the country's institutional life . In order to do this, it will pledge to surrender its weapons--the symbol of its rebellion--which it will continue with or without weapons, AVC leaders have said . The AVC leaders continue meeting at an unknown location in Guayaquil and expect to reach an agreement soon on laying down their weapons, which would then be destroyed immediately."

I remember the names: Sadaka, Amancia, Yair, and Teddy . I cannot remember the name of the fifth one . There were 11 British instructors . We used to call that one David . This man was an expert in explosives . He instructed us on how to use explosives . These were statements made by Biafara to the U.S. Senate in which we learned of a clear link between the Israeli mercenaries, who were training paramilitary groups in the middle Magdalena region, and the British mercenaries who came to the country allegedly to assassinate Pablo Escobar . Biafara knew both groups of mercenaries . According to his statements given to Das last March, not only did Israeli mercenaries train assassins in middle Magdalena, there was also a group of 11 British mercenaries, who gave lessons to 50 students . Among the instructors there was Peter Mclise, the name of one of the leaders of the operation against Pablo Escobar, and David, who Biafara clearly identified . He was David Tomkins, the man in charge of the plot against Escobar . According to Biafara, most British instructors had Tatoos on their breasts, arms, and shoulders, just as we can see on the Video taped by the British men who prepared the operation against Escobar .

The government Commission must clearly and publicly announce that it is willing to reach an agreement on confining the Army to its barracks on the day of the elections, establishing an electoral code by consensus, providing absentee voting for Salvadorans living abroad, restructuring the central elections Council, and forming a Council for verification . more importantly, it must express the state powers' willingness to postpone the elections for 5 months, once a cease-fire has been agreed upon . We also believe that the government Commission must publicly announce that it is willing to bring military commanders and officers responsible for political murders and crimes to trial, to reduce the Salvadoran armed forces to the number of troops it had in 1968, and to disband the security forces to form a new civil police . We reiterate our willingness to discuss permanently ceasing the armed struggle . 2 .

Following are Vargas Carreno's statements at a news conference he held in Buenos Aires before concluding his official visit to Argentina: this treaty used by the United States in 1989, during the past administration, to solve two problems connected with the Letelier case: the problem of compensation and the problem of the Chilean government's responsibility for the death of Orlando Letelier and his assistant . It has been agreed in principle to use the treaty exclusively to solve the problem of compensation; that is the objective when we refer to its partial use . so as for the compensation subject, it will be used . We are using the mechanism created by the five-member Commission established by the treaty . The language of this treaty was pertinent for the early decades of this century but is no longer in keeping with current international practices . During the news conference with Argentine and foreign journalists, Vargas Carreno also announced that President Carlos Menem will visit Chile in August in response to an invitation from Chilean President Patricio Aylwin, who will also visit Argentina at an as yet undetermined date . Vargas Carreno noted his satisfaction with his meetings in Buenos Aires with foreign minister Domingo Cavallo and Raul Carignano, under Secretary for Latin American affairs . Vargas Carreno said that as a result of this initial contact the Binational Commission established by the Chilean-Argentine peace and friendship treaty, which was signed in 1984, will meet next July . He said that the two countries will continue to hold formal and informal talks to discuss problems of common interest, speed up the integration process, and increase mutual understanding and cooperation . regarding the situation of hundreds of thousands of Chilean citizens living in Argentina--a total he estimated at 800,000--Vargas Carreno said that President Aylwin's government has established an office to help those citizens living abroad for various reasons to return to Chile, especially those living in Argentina's Patagonia region who are being treated Inhumanely, especially by businessmen in the border area, as reported by an Argentine journalist."

The din of gunfire and explosions could be heard before dawn in the Escalon neighborhood near the Sheraton hotel .

Air Force helicopters flew over the area and the sound of machinegun fire could be heard."
1312,TST1-MUC3-0013,LIMA,1989-12-20,"The executive branch has called a special session of Congress for tomorrow and the next day to consider the serious situation of Panama and to denounce the Inter-American reciprocal assistance treaty, Tiar, for its ineffectiveness . This was announced by President Alan Garcia at the conclusion of a Council of ministers meeting at government House today . The President also expressed his surprise over the Mildness with which the rest of the Latin American countries have reacted to the U.S . aggression against Panama . President Garcia also said that the fuel price increase will allow Petroperu to operate . What important subjects were discussed in the Council of ministers meeting today? the main subject was the decision to call a special congressional session on 22 and 23 December to consider the serious situation created by the U.S . invasion in Panama . The second important subject was the decision to denounce the Tiar, a military organization that groups all the Latin American countries and the United States and which, on several occasions, has proved to be absolutely ineffective and partial . The Malvinas Islands situation is a good example . According to the Tiar, the United States should have supported Argentina, but it did exactly the contrary, supporting the United Kingdom . Now, in this case with Panama, the Tiar has not served any purpose . rather, it has served to mask the U.S . invasion of Panama . Therefore, since we consider the Tiar to be ineffective and senseless, we, as a Republic, must denounce it . We must withdraw our signature from the Tiar . This must be done through Congress, and that is why we have called a special session . Several sectors have described the decision to withdraw the Peruvian ambassador to the United States as a hasty decision . What do you think of that? I think that those must be sectors committed to the invasion . They must support a rightist concept by which the United States has the Hegemonic right to safeguard our destiny and to decide who can govern us and who cannot . As Peruvians and Latin Americans, we feel that the aggressive and bloody action by U.S . troops to occupy a small country is a violation . There are currently nearly 30,000 U.S . soldiers in Panamanian territory . They have killed many people and they want to impose a new government . Thus, as long as those troops remain there, as long as this violation to Latin America is maintained, our Ambassador will not stay in that country . This does not imply a break in relations; it represents a clear gesture of condemnation and dislike . As long as a U.S . soldier violates the Republic of Panama, we will keep our Ambassador here . As long as the United States does not withdraw their troops and Panama remains occupied, the Panamanian and Peruvian flags will remain together . don't you think that this attitude could harm certain relations with the United States; that is, couldn't it jeopardize the IMF loan? not at all . These are two absolutely different things . The negotiations with the IMF are one thing; the International political attitude of a government that abuses its economic and military power with other countries is something else . Besides, we should mention something very important . As for Panamanian-U.S. relations, the Americans have been the main accomplices in depriving Panama of democracy . When elections took place in 1984, when Arnulfo Arias should have won, the United States decided that it was not convenient that Arias should win, so a large fraud--as it was declared at the time--was carried out to place Nicolas Ardito Barletta in power . The first ones to recognize Ardito were the Americans . Ardito was placed in the Presidency by Noriega . in 1985 Noriega removed Ardito and put Eric Arturo del Valle in his place . The Americans immediately recognized del Valle as President . Therefore, the United States has been Noriega's accomplice in depriving Panama of democracy . We denounced this . Noriega is a creation of the United States . It has repeatedly been said that Noriega worked with the United States and with the U.S. central intelligence agency, where President Bush was once chief . Therefore, now that the maid is answering back, making claims to the Panama Canal and wanting to become independent from the United States, the United States suddenly discovers that she is a drug Trafficker and that she does not serve its interests, so they send 30,000 U.S . soldiers to Panama . This is an abuse . It is a violation of the sovereignty of another state . No honorable Latin American country should tolerate this invasion without actively and openly condemning it . One way to condemn it and Express disapproval of it is to say that as long as the troops invading Latin America remain, we do not need to maintain our Ambassador there."

It is good that the network presents these pictures of people crying, manipulating their emotions . those tears were shed over 50 years of oppression and misery, and over the bombings that have destroyed Zacamil neighborhood . officers, the bombs have caused all that sorrow and the destruction of 500 houses in Zacamil . As we were saying, officers, you must ask yourselves: who are you dying for? for Colonel Ponce's mansions in Miami? for general Bustillo's mansions? Why are the armed forces members dying here? Why are the lieutenants, the Capitains dying, while the members of the armed forces hierarchy are Confortably sitting in their air-conditioned offices being guarded while they are at ease, but not really at ease as combat is taking place just a few blocks from their office . officers, lieutenants, captains, this is the appeal the Fmln wants make to you today, at a time when the future of the Fatherland is at stake? You must think this over, you must make a decision, and you must do this soon . history is moving fast, and the time is ripe . So when you are told that you are defending the Constitution, think about what we are telling you . If you are defending the Constitution, think about what we are saying . If we are defending the Constitution here, why is this Constitution being violated by those Rambos sent by President Bush to El Salvador? you all know this little group of Rambos is good for nothing, as they are cowards . They did not want to leave the Sheraton hotel, because the guerrillas were there . They are cowards, just like their system . They are Tinhorn Rambos, who are absolutely no good . As we said yesterday, if those men who left the Sheraton like common criminals covering their faces from the International press are the ones who are training the armed forces, we can understand better why the Fmln is defeating the tactics taught by them . They are no good, because they do not understand our people, they underestimate our people . officers, you know those U.S. advisers underestimate you, they look down on you, as little Indians, as Donkeys . You know how they think of you . You Kow they mock the Salvadoran officers . officers, you know very well how these U.S. advisers treat our soldiers . They are haughty, arrogant, and cowards . You saw them at the Sheraton hotel, Pissing in their pants, they did not want to leave the hotel . A Commission went there, the Red Cross went there, but they did not want to leave, because they were not sure of themselves during the truce, simply because they are cowards .

The arena leader is of the opinion that the armed forces themselves were the ones that exerted pressure so that the Jesuits' murder case could be Cleared-Up . It was not the institution that was involved in the problem . Regrettably some of its members did it and now the entire armed forces are under pressure for political reasons . However, we must realize that it is thanks to the armed forces that we have this democratic process, with a hope that our country develops and recovers . It is very unfair that some people pass judgment or criticize without really knowing how hard it has been on all the officers, noncommissioned officers, and troops who have had to put up with these attacks in addition to the intense work they have had for the past few months . D'Aubuisson said that once the murder of the six Jesuits has been cleared up, U.S . authorities have no reason to question the continuation of U.S. economic assistance to the country . The Jesuits' case was a determining factor . But now that the case has been fully solved with the help of the FBI, Scotland yard, and investigators from other countries, this is no longer a problem, although previously it was serious . I do not believe there can be any doubt now about receiving the aid, especially after the tremendous offensive launched by the Fmln . For argument's sake, if the situation did arise, this would only favor the Fmln . I know the Fmln has a whole range of support groups that handle Disinformation and make it appear as if things here were disastrous . for example, information abroad is that the Air Force leveled all the neighborhoods . We Salvadorans know that the Air Force was excessively cautious and did an excellent job Repelling this attack with a minimum of civilians wounded . for that matter, if we are going to compare things, U.S. military operations in Panama were more clumsy--there they set a whole neighborhood on fire . The arena leader also denied that there were differences between President Cristiani and himself . According to international press agencies, the decision of the Salvadoran President to prosecute the military men involved in the Jesuits' murder caused division within the party . D'Aubuisson denied this was true . not in the least . There have never been any differences with President Cristiani . on the contrary, we are very close and grateful for the great effort, work, and the magnificent job President Cristiani is doing . This is reason for pride not only among friends of President Cristiani but for the party and friends of the Salvadoran government . In Commenting on the dialogue with the Fmln, D'Aubuisson supported President Critiani's initiative of engaging the assistance of the UN Secretary General . I do not think he has the time to act as mediator; however, he could act as a Guarantor, receiving results of these talks and ensuring compliance with the commitments made . Maj Roberto D'Aubuisson, currently an arena deputy, said that this year he will dedicate his time to expand and reorganize the party to get ready for the 1991 municipal and parliamentary elections . He will most likely not be an arena deputy in the next legislative period, because he, along with other former legislators, will concentrate their political activities on the central American Parliament."

The Das adds that Dean Shelley, Peter Mcaleese, Alex Lenox, and Andres Gibson entered the country in previously and settled in the drug traffickers extreme right-wing groups' military training camps in Puerto Boyaca, middle Magdalena region, La Azulita, Puerto Lopez, and El Recreo on the Northeastern Flatlands . radio stations' reports added that Colonel Yair Klein has been identified among the Israeli mercenaries by the secret services of his country . Klein was commander of a paratroopers' unit in 1983 and apparently has a private security agency in Israel . Abraham Tzadaka and Jacobo Brine were also identified by their fellow countrymen . on a national newscast broadcast several weeks ago a Video which shows the Israeli mercenaries wearing blue uniforms during war maneuvers with the Drug-Traffickers far right-wing groups' private Army . The scenes were reproduced by the NBC television network in the United States . previous reports from the Das, revealed in Colombia, indicate that the COLOMBIANS trained by the mercenaries include persons linked with the self-defense groups in the middle Magdalena region and the recently created Morena . The first persons to notify the Prosecutor general of the nation, the highest authority, about the presence of foreign mercenaries among the Drug-Traffickers far right-wing armed groups were Deserters from the middle Magdalena self-defense groups--identified as Jesus Alberto Molina Urrea, Ricaurte Duque Arboleda, and Victor Arboleda Duque . According to the Deserters' declarations, the Israeli mercenaries cannot speak Spanish and they frequently met with Gonzalo de Jesus Perez, Henry Perez, and Marcelo Perez . According to the Das report revealed today,``the Perezes ,""are important members of the Association of middle Magdalena cattlemen, the self-defense groups, and Morena; and the authorities charge them with the mass murders of peasants in Uraba, located in the country's Northwestern area."

Navy Lieutenant Justo Martinez, commander of the port of the Bolivian city of Copacabana, reported that a bomb exploded in the Peruvian town of Yunguyo, which is located near the border between the two countries, approximately 10 km from Copacabana . Martinez added that the offices of the deputy Mayor, a civilian office occupied by the provincial governor, was the objective of the terrorist attack . The Navy officer told La Paz radio Panamericana that Reconnaisance patrols have been sent to the border with Peru and other``critical""points of Copacabana Bay in order to guard the Presidential meeting . It is in front of this Lake Titicaca Bay that Paz Zamora and Garcia will meet today to discuss bilateral topics and matters pertaining to drug trafficking . Bolivia and Peru grow 90 percent of the world's Coca leaves, which are used to produce cocaine."

The spokesman added that the arrest order against the former officer had been revoked because one of the persons implicated in the case had withdrawn his accusations against former Mayor Gonzalo Gonzalez . According to this report, the witness said he had accused Gonzalez for personal reasons . Therefore, Gonzalez is no longer accused in the Justines Rodriguez crime."
1328,TST1-MUC3-0029,BEIJING ,1989-11-30,"On 30 November when U.S. President Bush set forth to Malta to meet with Soviet leader Gorbachev, a report from Angola said that a central intelligence agency airplane on a clandestine mission of delivering weapons to the Antigovernment National Union for the total independence of Angola crashed in Southern Angola on 27 November and that the four Americans on the plane were killed . Today both the U.S. State Department and the Defense Department confirmed the crash, but they refused to comment on whether the Americans who were killed were CIA officials, or on the nature of the plane's mission . This is in sharp contrast to the response that the U.S. government made a few days ago in connection with a plane crash in El Salvador . after a plane carrying weapons to the Salvadoran guerrillas crashed on 25 November, U.S. Secretary of State Baker promptly instructed the Undersecretary of state on that same evening to summon the Soviet ambassador to the United States to protest to the Soviet Union for undermining peace in Central America and``failing to exercise its influence""to stop Cuba and Nicaragua from delivering weapons to the guerrillas in El Salvador . In this connection, a U.S. government official pointed out that President Bush would present the central America issue as an important issue while discussing problems of regional conflicts with Soviet leaders during their Mediterranean meeting . Some officials even said that the central America issue is the``principal obstacle""to the improvement of U.S.-Soviet relations, and that only when the USSR makes further concessions on the central America issue will it be possible for the United States to provide economic assistance to the Soviet Union . in a ceasefire accord signed on 24 June this year, Unita and the Angolan government agreed to seek ways and means to conclude the Civil War that had gone on for 14 years . However, the U.S. government keeps supplying weapons to Unita . According to U.S. newspapers, ever since the South African authorities stopped supplying weapons to Unita last April, the United States has become Unita's main weapon supplier . The secret that the United States' military assistance to Unita increased from $15 million to $50 million this year was revealed after the crash of the CIA's weapon carrier . Now, even the U.S. press has asked this question: could it prevent President Bush from presenting his criticism when problems of regional conflicts are discussed when he meets the Soviet leader? a U.S. State Department official said:``not at all ,""`` We will not place on a par .""a State Department official also said that the U.S. government will continue to provide``appropriate and effective assistance""to Unita in the future."
1329,TST1-MUC3-0030,NO CITY ,1989-09-16,"As a Latin American President, I feel a little bit uncomfortable over the statement that the North Americans are victims of the drugs produced in Latin America and that Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia are to blame for producing the drugs; let's call those countries to talk with them . that seems to me a very Ethnocentric vision; it looks at this matter from only one side . Our peasants are poor people who produce whatever is most profitable, and Coca cultivation happens to be most profitable for them . This is so, speaking coldly, honestly, and sincerely . As President of Peru I have to point out that my people, the Huallage region peasants, cannot be considered as criminals or as people who must be jailed for producing Coca leaves . We have exchanged these views with President Barco, and we reached these conclusions . We must also note that this matter has been handled with a great deal of publicity . after the death of Carlos Galan, a great Colombian leader, the Colombian government launched an offensive intended to find out whether the drug trafficking bands were responsible for his assassination, and the U.S. government then extended some assistance . This assistance has been present to the world as though the United States had sent an enormous quantity of aircraft, hundreds of helicopters, and thousands of millions of dollars to Colombia . As I was able to see in Bogota, only helicopters, some of which had been purchased earlier by the Colombian government, were sent . I was also informed that some of those helicopters had been used previously in Peru . I have said that, if there is that much conviction, I support President Bush for defending U.S. society . If he has that much conviction, it is hard to believe that less than one thousandth of what is spent in arms and military expenditures should be allocated to replace Coca plantations and to improve the general situation in Latin America . We have talked with President Barco, and I will talk with President Paz Zamora to see how we can exchange opinions . Then, as President Bush said, a meeting of Presidents will be welcome . But the meeting should also be attended by Europe, which has a fundamental interest in the future . would the idea be to hold a meeting in the near future of Peru, Colombia, and Bolivia with President Bush and a representative of the EEC? Yes, because drug trafficking is a growing problem . cartels have sprouted in Colombia--monopolies that try to elect deputies and senators to influence the government . Those monopolies might extend their operations to our countries if we do not stop this growing problem . The situation can become worse in Bolivia, where it was said that the drug traffickers had an influence on a dictatorial military regime . It is not just a matter of protecting the morality of humanity; it is not just a matter of defending the United States, which has a primary role in world leadership; it is essentially a matter of defending our democracy--the legitimacy and Cleanliness of our social life . I hope that we can have a meeting of the three Presidents first, so that we can let the U.S. President know our views on the overall problem . will you propose that meeting, Mr President? I don't want to assume a leading role . The idea emerged in a conversation with President Barco, and I will talk later with President Paz Zamora . a meeting between you and President Bush late this month has been mentioned . is this true, Mr President? no, I believe that has been mere speculation in the press . for the time being I have discarded the idea of making another trip abroad . I do not see the concrete possibility of meeting with President Bush, although I hope we can meet sometime before 28 July 1990 . changing the subject, Mr President--much has been said in recent days about the possible or probable expulsion of Peru from the IMF . What is the truth about this, and what would expulsion mean? well, first, it is politically impossible for Peru to be expelled from the IMF . Second, there is misinformation and Alarmism regarding the matter . What is the IMF? it is some sort of creditor bank created in 1946 that lends money to countries with balance-of-payments problems; that is, with problems with their foreign reserves levels . When a country has no reserves or only $100 million in reserves, it can apply for a credit from the IMF to pay for imports or overdue debts . This is the IMF, an organization created to facilitate the flow of international financial resources . An IMF credit is dependent on signing a letter of intent or an adjustment program . adjustment means reducing the country's internal consumption so as to spare the country's reserves in order to meet debt obligations."

1331,TST1-MUC3-0032,BUENOS AIRES,1990-05-18,"Next June an entire U.S. Army company will carry out joint maneuvers with Argentine troops in a province of the Littoral region . The maneuvers, designed to teach the Argentine officers the latest techniques against drug trafficking, fall within the comprehensive military exchange plan . General Maxwell Thurman's visit is also part of the aforementioned plan . According to reliable sources, the recent visit from the United States of 10 Lieutenant colonels, three colonels, and eight civilian experts in defense strategy, represent an important step in the renewed U.S.-Argentine military relationship . the same sources have stated that the gradual and restricted participation of the Army in maneuvers designed to practice fighting against drug trafficking has been authorized by the defense Ministry and even by the President . The military group that arrived in Argentina on 6 may carried out war games at the war school and the Campo de Mayo military school and, later on, carried out field maneuvers . Other forces participated in the three-day maneuvers that were carried out on an island in the river plate Delta . According to a witness, the maneuvers consisted of``raids""including``surprise""situations that forced the U.S . troops to endure bad weather and bad terrain . According to the final evaluation, the maneuvers were regarded as``satisfactory and successful"". According to the program, a complete U.S. company that will train with Argentine troops in a province of the Littoral region is scheduled to arrive in June . Foreign Ministry sources confirmed the existence of exchange plans but stated that general Thurman had proposed to the Chiefs of staff the possibility of carrying out joint maneuvers to fight drug trafficking during a luncheon . The sources stated that the Chiefs of staff have made some objections to the proposal and did not reach any agreement . However, sources that participated in the recent maneuvers on the island had a different opinion and ratified that another maneuver would be held in a province of the Littoral in June . anyhow, the statement of the foreign Ministry spokesman falls within the diplomatic policy that may partly differ with the military and defense policies, as was pointed out by a sector of the media yesterday . Moreover, General Thurman will remain in San Carlos de Bariloche until Saturday , 19 may, and that same day will fly to the Iguazu falls from where he will return to his military base in Panama . The only purpose of General Thurman's visit was to offer the defense Ministry all the technology, know how, and weapons for the struggle against drug trafficking which, in many cases turns into Narcoterrorism, in other words, the use of drug trafficking to finance the purchase of weapons and terrorist actions . Thurman's visit, which took the United States a whole year to arrange, was previously approved by the U.S. Senate . within the same framework, the Bolivian police have just received weapons and other equipment amounting to $50 million, which is enough to equip two complete battalions in charge of fighting drug traffickers . Therefore, the Argentine government's decision to contribute to the struggle against drug trafficking launched by the United States is part of a comprehensive strategy of the Southern cone of which Argentina--according to experts--must participate out of fear of a growing isolation . It is quite likely that the restricted and gradual--by no means massive--participation of the Army and probably the Navy in maneuvers for the struggle against drug trafficking may be the key that will finally allow the armed forces to acquire the war materiel, spare parts and other elements it needs . The analysts have recalled that the U.S. government's determination to fight corruption--a problem that also worries President Carlos Menem and vice president Eduardo Duhalde--falls within the same framework because, in the experts' opinion, it is the equivalent to drug trafficking . highly reliable sources have recalled that 30 days ago President George Bush sent President Menem two volumes of a U.S . edition on techniques to fight corruption."

The peace process between M-19 and the National government was seriously jeopardized this week due to the murder of two members of that guerrilla organization, which occurred at the border between Cauca and Valle del Cauca departments .

The Salvadoran Air Force attacked the outskirts of San Salvador with machinegun fire and rockets just as President Cristiani rejected the dialogue proposal made by the guerrillas on 22 November . four``push and pull""planes and two helicopter gunships opened fire on alleged Farabundo Marti National liberation front columns in northern San Salvador .``their proposal is not serious, are once again saying that there are two armed forces . In El Salvador there is only one armed force ,""Cristiani said . He added that a political solution entails that the guerrillas end the violence . The President, accompanied by Colonel Rene Emilio Ponce, chief of staff of the armed forces, said in a news conference that the Fmln proposal``is not very serious""because``It is not aimed at the government but at the Army, which is part of the government ,""he said . According to Cristiani, the new Fmln proposal is``propagandist""and is only meant to gain some time in view of the``military defeat suffered in the last few days .""Cristiani said that the government is willing to seek a rational solution to the military conflict in this country, but he categorically emphasized that this means that the guerrillas must lay down their weapons and join the democratic process .``We will not allow the guerrillas to regroup and begin attacking again . If they want to hold a dialogue, they should lay down their weapons and peacefully join the democratic process ,""Cristiani said . The President warned that``the government and the armed forces are willing to fight militarily . It all depends on whether the Fmln continues to behave this way, not listening to reason, and not ending this madness ,""the rightist President said . The news conference, held with some 50 journalists, was abruptly interrupted by the heavy bombings carried out by the Salvadoran Air Force against alleged guerrilla columns . following the first bombings, which rocked the military offices where the news conference was being held, Cristiani and Ponce resumed control of the conference and explained that the attack was the result of an operation in pursuit of the``guerrillas fleeing in disarray .""the Air Force bombing began shortly before the Curfew, which began at 1800 until 0600 in the morning, just when thousands of Salvadorans were returning home . The heavy explosions caused alarm among the population in northern San Salvador and it is unknown whether civilians have been hurt . According to Cristiani, the guerrilla offensive``has been a failure""not only militarily, but politically as well because they were unable to incite the people to rebellion, as they planned . The proposal signed by the top five Fmln commanders and read on the official rebel station, clandestine radio Venceremos, has been released in the framework of a rebel military offensive, which began 12 days ago and which has left more than 1,000 people dead, hundreds of people wounded, and tens of thousands of people homeless."

1341,TST1-MUC3-0042,TEGUCIGALPA,1989-12-20,"Following the U.S . invasion of Grenada Island, the world discarded any further possibility of a U.S. armed operation against another nation of the American continent, despite the deterioration of its relations with other governments and Provocations against the U.S. government . It was believed that the U.S. would confine its participation to supporting and sponsoring movements aimed at ousting governments or, as in the case of Nicaragua, of supporting rebel forces to achieve the goals set by the White House . The events that occurred early this morning in Panama have surprised the world because, despite general Manuel Antonio Noriega's challenging attitude, no one thought the U.S. would invade Panama . Noriega was certain the U.S. government would not do so, and supposed that U.S. attitudes against him would consist of sponsoring rebellion, such as the recent 3-October attempt, when the U.S. government encouraged members of the Panamanian defense forces to rebel against their Commander in chief . Noriega never thought the U.S. government would ever conduct a military operation against Panama, although there were U.S . troops based on the canal zone . He continued under this impression because never before had these troops changed from their role of surveillance, not even when Washington promoted the rebellion of some young officers of the Panamanian forces . This excessive security distracted Noriega and encouraged him to challenge the U.S. policies . Noriega did not believe the U.S . threats and he adopted an Omnipotent stance, like his recent decision to appoint himself the Supreme leader of Panama . Noriega believed that the United States would continue to support subversion in his country, and that the U.S. decision to support the opposition currently in exile would produce movements against his regime, or that a commando might attempt to Kidnap him . as a result of this belief, he increased the strength of the military forces and equipped many civilians who supported him with weapons to be ready to dismantle movements that tried to destabilize his government . as the clocks struck midnight in Panama, the U.S . forces began an operation against the Panamanian defense force barracks . The troops already based in Panama, and those flown in from bases in California and in other cities near Panama, started a massive attack to oust Gen Noriega . The invasion, which seemed possible to some and to others, were mainly conducted to punish someone who has been declared one of the most important Latin American drug traffickers by the U.S. courts . early this morning, sources close to the White House announced that the operation was aimed at capturing Noriega and taking him to the United States to be tried for the crimes attributed to him by the U.S. courts, at ensuring compliance with the treaties on the Panama Canal, and at restoring democracy in the country following the Farcical May-L989 elections . These are the reasons for the U.S. armed intervention in Panama, which is filling the world with Trepidation due to the danger hovering over the continent and the fact that President Bush's decision has gone beyond the logic of the U.S. policy toward Latin America . International observers did, however, guess that something was about to occur when President Bush said recently that while the U.S. government could reach agreement with Nicaragua, with Noriega it was impossible to reach any agreement, and that the United States had to do something about this veiled danger that threatened the American continent . today, Panama has become a battlefield . The capital and other cities are battlefields on which the government forces are fighting the U.S. units in ground, air, and Maritime operations that seek to oust Manuel Antonio Noriega . The U.S. action is focussing the world's attention on Washington's decision . Many nations will protest and reject the U.S . invasion which was disguised by a series of Peace-Seeking actions . four days before Christmas Eve, the ghost of war is haunting our continent . We must ponder on the need to keep Honduras on the Democratic path, and to avoid the anarchy that destroys nations and Decimates peoples . The events that have kept the world in vigil since midnight will continue for hours, days, or maybe weeks because, so far, the news is very confusing and civilian victims are dying on the streets of the Panamanian towns."
1342,TST1-MUC3-0043,CLANDESTINE,,"Commander, do the Rn leaders agree that the Fmln should eventually join the Socialist International as has been proposed concerning the Sandinist National liberation front in Nicaragua? We think so, because SI has represented, for the past 30-40 years, a European international political bloc that has supported the struggle .... that has shown interest in the third world . In other words, we believe that every international political bloc that truly wants to establish relations and help--while still defending European interests--is viable and positive . The Fmln must necessarily join the SI . in the 1970's struggle in our country and the war resulted from a decision adopted by the people's revolutionary Army . virtually no one talks about this within the Fmln now, yet the right-wing sectors always remember the resulting situations within the Left-Wing sectors . What does the Rn think Abut the Erp in 1990? we have stated and we have put it in writing--it is good to have it in writing--that the left became divided and the Erp became divided because we were not firm enough, politically and ideologically speaking . We believe that the Erp leadership acted childishly, but we can now say that we have achieved maturity in every sector . The options we have chosen within the Fmln have allowed us to clearly see the outcome of the decisions we adopted in the past . This has obviously been and misconstrued by the enemy in its propaganda and psychological war, because it loves to say that Revolutionaries always end up killing each other . The ideological struggle indicates that we and unity has prevailed within the Fmln . We consider the division a process that is part of El Salvador's history and we should not cry over spilt milk . No one should deplore .... we cannot speculate on what might have happened . It was the result of our immaturity . commander, everyone knows the names of the Fmln leaders--particularly the five members of the general command--but this is something new . You were previously known as Ferman Cienfuegos and not everyone knew that you were Eduardo Sancho Colombari . There is always a clandestine element involved . Why is there always a tendency to remain anonymous? I think that after 10 or 20 years in hiding we political conduct that does not correspond to modern times and our political needs . Therefore, the general command needs specific conditions, meaning the need for the general command members to go public . We believe that the general command members should go public and state their views so that they people can learn more about them, their human side, and their personalities . It is important for the people and the world to know about the leaders' personalities as they are . This has been--let us call it a defect or limitation . secrecy is a deviation and a person can maintain .... combine secrecy with our political role . We now we have to overcome that deviation, meaning secrecy and anonymity . Yes . I believe we are trying to overcome this."
1343,TST1-MUC3-0044,SAN SALVADOR,1990-05-02,"We now have Colonel Sigifredo Ochoa Perez on the telephone . The Armed Forces, particularly the commanders of the various Army branches and Garrisons who were convened by the defense Minister, made a statement against this officer, who is a deputy and the current Cel President, after he demanded justice in the case of the assassinated Jesuit priests . We will now listen to Col Ochoa, who will make known his stand since the armed forces' statement was released . good morning, Colonel . good morning . Thanks, Raul . These gentlemen seem to be speaking in the name of the entire armed forces . I know well what was discussed in the meeting . Someone even said that the bright idea of discharging me was considered . They failed to take into account, however, that I am a deputy and that, as a deputy and a citizen, I am entitled to express what I feel, just as I have done . I, who owe everything to the armed forces, who fought beside the soldiers as Monterrosa, Carlitos, and very few others did, never got rich when in the armed forces, as some of the commanders did, although not all of them, of course . This undoubtedly has irritated them . I have simply expressed my viewpoint as a soldier concerned about the armed forces' situation . I never mentioned any names . I simply demanded justice because, even according to military theory, I cannot conceive that such an important decision could have been made by a single person . I still think this is a plot by some members of the institution, not by the armed forces as such . I only have respect and love for the armed forces . I am concerned over the delicate situation to which the institution could be led because of the actions of some Nefarious members . I have deep respect for the officers in the field, who fight every day . of course, I must criticize those who have profited from the institution and who today have raised the roof, as if I were the one to blame and as if I were undermining the Institutionality of the state . quite the opposite is true . My criticism is positive and intends to encourage a deeper investigation and exhaust all resources in this direction . I would like them to stop making ridiculous demands and to stop seeking a confrontation . It is known that what I am demanding is what is being felt and said . I am not accusing anyone in particular . I am only demanding justice . commanders' meetings should not be held to make such a statement . They should have instead shown their concern over the armed forces' situation . I would have been very interested in seeing them take the stand to continue the investigation to the last consequences . as the military man I am, I only assessed the situation . I never mentioned any names, but insisted that a deeper inquiry should be made to carry out justice, because otherwise it is the institution that will suffer . Col Ochoa, after the``sixty minutes""program on CBS in the United States, it seems that in this capital and in the country your remarks and your interpretation of the Jesuits' case were distorted . Today there has been an attempt to accuse you . It has been said that the cut in U.S. aid to the Salvadoran armed forces is the result of your remarks, rather than of the slowness in the investigation of the Jeusit priests' case . do you think there has been ill intent in this, or that there has been an attempt to take advantage of you to try to justify an action? I think so . There has been an attempt to blame me, as if I could influence the decision-making of the U.S. Congress . a reduction in military aid to El Salvador has been under consideration for months because the expected results have not been obtained . I think it is ridiculous and childish to say that the aid will be cut as the result of my remarks . The truth is that all crimes with which some armed forces' members have jeopardized the institution should be punished . My understanding is that solidarity should exist in the context of operations and the fulfillment of the armed forces' constitutional mission . However, those who harm the institution should not be protected . I think some are trying to take advantage of the situation, as if to say: Col Ochoa has endangered the armed forces . What has endangered the institution is the murder of the Jesuits and the San Sebastian people . I canot agree with the perpetration of outrages . One thing is to fight fairly with the enemy . There are dead in every war . I said this very clearly when I was 4TH infantry Brigade commander in cabanas . I agreed with the penetration into the population to help them . I feel satisfied over my passage through the armed forces as a commander, because I identified myself both with my men and the civilian population . At no time did I take advantage of the institution to acquire illegal riches . to point these things out is not to attack the armed forces . quite the contrary, it is because I love it that I have criticized the negative members . The Armed forces can thus be spared greater damage by the poor actions of some of its members . Colonel, in the past few hours we have heard reports that you are to be supported by the Army's younger officers and some unions, even the Cel Union . What can you tell us about this situation?"

The Fmln, the document adds, REITERATES its determination to stop those who are involved in the Genocidal war--those who every day Shell the rural areas and Persecute and murder peasants, workers, and students--from taking it easy and relaxing at their clubs and in their exclusive neighborhoods . The attack on the national police station at the Manuel Jose Arce military neighborhood follows this same line of Destabilization . Therefore, we call on our people to pay attention to the recommendations and orders issued by our fighters and to thereby prevent regrettable losses . We warn Bodyguards and security guards that we will fight those who are armed and who offer resistance . In conclusion, the Fmln communique released a few hours ago adds: We reiterate that we will continue to abide by our revolutionary principles and stick to the truth . We did not participate in incidents such as the attack against Antonio Rodriguez Porth and Edgar Chacon . These incidents resulted from a war within arena ranks, and we warn that acts of repression unleashed by the government against the popular and democratic movements will not go unpunished and will receive a strong response from our forces .

1351,TST1-MUC3-0052,BOGOTA,1990-02-04,"I believe that here in the Department, the experience with mayors elected by the people, has been satisfactory . Most of them have been responsible to the communities they represent . They have been working and all have a favorable balance . why not allow citizens to freely and spontaneously Excercise the right to vote again . This would continue the democratization and decentralization process needed by the country to progress and find peace . I believe we should take advantage of the wonderful services rendered by Dr. Rafael Pardo, the National rehabilitation plan director, to attempt to find new roads toward achieving dialogue with these two sectors, especially with the ELN . It is not easy to find peace, especially for this Department . We must at least make attempts to hold dialogue with this guerrilla group, which has shown it can easily move around and disrupt stability and public order in the Department of North Santander . Mr . Governor, up to now, have ELN or Epl subversives tried to attain this dialogue? well, no . It has not been easy, besides we believe these are initiatives that should be started by the peace commissioners, as they have experience in such conversations, contacts, and dialogues . that is why I mentioned that, perhaps, through Dr. Rafael Pardo, who has been the National government's delegate, attempts will be made to search for such possibilities . I believe the government has been making efforts to attain peace in the country, and the quicker we attain this, the better it will be for the security and stability of Colombia . have you already sent an invitation or asked Dr. Rafael Pardo to come to your Department? we have talked to him over the past few days about the public order situation and other situations that require special attention . However, the entire country knows that Dr. Pardo has been working virtually full-time to further the peace conversations with M-19 . the entire country has been pleased and very happy with these conversations because they have been an important initiation for President Virgilio Barco's peace process . But Dr. Rafael Pardo Rueda does not dislike the idea of holding such conversations? I am sure he does not dislike the idea because he has been trying to do this for a long time . When could these conversations take place? just give us a tentative date . could it be within days or this week? surely this week we will again have to study the public order situation in our Department and surely we will be able to analyze this proposal again and I believe Dr. Pardo will seriously take it into account . Some of the country's political leaders--not only in northern Santander, but in several areas of the country--are very concerned about the constant raids by subversive groups, and their murdered Mayors, officials, and political leaders and the kidnapping of national civil Registry office personnel . They indicate that with actions of this type it would be very difficult for people to freely express themselves by voting in the next elections . Yes, surely all these incidents can, in a certain manner, weaken the electoral vote . However, everyday we are more convinced that COLOMBIANS want to Excercise this right without any type of limitations and make efforts--including heroic actions--to continue this campaign so that elections can be held throughout the National territory . voting is the real expression of democracy and we will all fight for it . We are sure that the government, through the armed forces, will do everything possible for the upcoming elections to be held without problems . However, it is a huge effort, as it has to confront a series of apprehensions or fears that have been instilled in some people."

Many civilians have been wounded and many houses have been destroyed . In other words, there has been no respect whatsoever--perhaps because those neighborhoods are located closest to the 3D infantry Brigade, and that seems to worry this man very much . This could be the reason for such an attitude and for that Genocidal situation . In other places, clashes occurred practically all day long on 12 and 13 November, and during the early morning hours of 14 November in the Milagro de la Paz neighborhood where we caused a considerable number of casualties . In addition, our forces foiled and stopped the Arce Battalion, Ponce Battalion, Leon Battalion, and the Monterrosa forces surveillance and security measures, and to handle any type of emergency, including bombings, mortar attacks, and Strafings . This means that the terrain must be prepared to defend the population . We also have a number of instruction regarding the tasks to be done during times of combat, but this is geared toward the population who decides to participate by directly supporting the Fmln . This involves many people . they can join new forces and groups in charge of the trenches, security measures, Couriers, and all kinds of tasks to support the war . In sum, the instructions to the population are to organize themselves because, once organized, they can give and counter it . The other issue is the calls to the population to participate in the struggle and above all not to let anyone intimidate them . They should not let anyone stop them from going out to purchase their food and whatever else they need . given the emergency situation and the shortage of medicine and food, we think it is necessary for the people of San Miguel to open the stores where they can get food, medicine, and any other items which are urgently needed for their and survival . that is all for now . greetings to the comrades who are listening in the capital, all the comrade fighters, and the Salvadoran people in general . their high morale and active role in the capital makes us feel proud .

1353,TST1-MUC3-0054,LIMA,1989-08-15,"Good evening . The electoral campaign is now under way . ten candidates are running for Mayor of Lima . We must participate in the elections to preserve democracy in our country . However, the electoral atmosphere that prevails should not make us forget our most serious problem, the greatest threat to our Fatherland . This threat is terrorism which costs lives, inflicts economic harm, fosters insecurity, and cuts off the power that we need for our homes and our industries . We continue to battle terrorism . The Armed Forces and the national police are taking drastic action in the Huallaga Valley and in the mountain range . They are also breaking up urban terrorist cells . However, we must also attack terrorists through legal actions, through the most drastic and severe sentences . irrespective of military actions, if no swift and drastic legal punishment is meted, the terrorists know that they will go unpunished . stimulated by this they continue with their crimes . The whole country is aware of this . Most Peruvians want severe, drastic and effective punishment for terrorists . Thus, on 28 July I proposed to the National Congress that the military courts should try terrorists . Tonight, I would like to remind you of this subject because I am concerned that it may remain just that; a proposal . I would also like to ask all Peruvians, all organizations and institutions, to support this request which will be discussed in Congress . by having terrorists tried by military courts we are not giving up any civilian prerogatives . We are not giving up any democratic rights . This has been done before in other Democratic countries . Furthermore, the armed forces are an essential component of Peru's democratic system . They are also the ones that actually fight the battle against subversion . No one can say that setting up military courts is tantamount to Militarizing the country because that would imply Distrusting the armed forces, offending them and overlooking the fact that they are defending democracy . more than 2 years ago we asked for and were allowed to establish special courts to terrorist cases . so far these courts have yielded no positive results . Thus, as President it is my duty to call for severe sentences, issued without delay or any theoretical or academic discussions . Following my 28 July speech I ascertained that the vast majority of Peruvians are in favor of drastic punishments and of the establishment of military courts . I have also heard some legal objections and theoretical arguments against this measure . those who do not want the military courts to try terrorists say that article 282 of the Constitution does not allow it . This is half true . article 282 States: in cases of crimes committed while on duty, police and armed forces members are subject to the military jurisdiction and to the military code of justice which is not applicable to civilians except in the case described by article 235, which establishes the application of the death sentence in case of betrayal of the motherland during war . Now, those who do not want military courts to try terrorists do not want to read the second part of article 282 which States: those who avoid compulsory military service are subject to the military code of justice . This paragraph is the one that legally and constitutionally allows us to try terrorists under the military jurisdiction, because terrorists also violate the compulsory military service law when they commit crimes . Many Peruvians wrongfully think that the compulsory military service only affects men on active service, like those Peruvians who, after a selection are sent to serve in a military Garrison for 1 or 2 years . This is only one of the ways in which one complies with the compulsory military service . The compulsory military service law States in Article 2: the compulsory military service in an unavoidable duty of all Peruvians who must participate in national defense by complying with their military obligations."

In addition, the group of eight has described Cristiani's rejection of the central American Presidents meeting, scheduled for Managua, as a political Outbourst .

Although the peace process is under way, we have received reports that the Fmln command has authorized a plan to step up violence in San Salvador through the use of Ground-To-Air missiles . We believe that this shows absolutely no willingness to bring about peace in our country . The media should reveal to all Salvadorans and the entire world what the Fmln is planning to do .

Our objective has been to seek peace in good will . However, I repeat, we will not lend ourselves to a Fmln tactical game . I do not believe that we can make any predictions at this moment . The outcome will depend on these alleged plans and developments in Costa Rica . an end to the hostilities will be discussed in this round of talks . Thus, this meeting could be crucial for achieving national peace . Cristiani maintained that this meeting will be useful to gauge the intentions of the guerrilla front . We will present a government proposal . It is an broad proposal because it deals with various issues, even the possible incorporation of the Fmln to civilian and Democratic life . It specifically deals with an end to the hostilities, a topic that we had agreed to address in Costa Rica during our meeting in Mexico . We are willing to discuss any topic that is within our constitutional framework for the sake of democracy . The President described as beneficial the UN and OAS presence at the talks, because they will guarantee compliance with the agreements signed in Costa Rica . only a day before the beginning of the talks between the government and the Fmln, the President said that despite an increase in war actions, the meeting in Costa Rica will not face obstacles."

The President has ordered 3 days of national mourning in honor of the Slain Minister . We are going to respond legally . We will immediately begin the requisite exhaustive investigations to find and punish those responsible for a crime against the life of an exemplary citizen . President Alfredo Cristiani blamed the Fmln for Minister Rodriguez Porth's death . He said this attack is part of a series of actions aimed at destabilizing the new government . We are virtually convinced that this was an Fmln effort, an Fmln incident, to try and provoke a reaction from our government . We feel that the investigations will undoubtedly show us who is to blame for this regrettable incident; however, I repeat we are almost sure that this was done by the Fmln . We had hoped the Fmln would refrain from this type of barbaric action; however, it is the duty of the armed forces and the security Corps to offer protection . This is why they have been deployed: to offer greater safety and protection to the people . During this evening's radio Venceremos newscast, however, the rebels neither claimed nor denied responsibility for the attack . Nevertheless, president Cristiani said the assassination may have been carried out by the Fmln in an attempt to hinder the dialogue . We had learned, even before the Inauguration, that the Fmln would try to hinder the transition from one government to another and later create anarchic situations for the new government . This could be part of that plan . I also feel that this could be the Fmln's way to force us to sit down and talk . It would be regrettable that after receiving a formal offer to sit down to talk--first about the mechanisms to be used as guidelines during the talks and later to broach the main issues in an attempt to reach a lasting peace in our country--the Fmln should still think that such actions are necessary . I think they are only trying to disrupt the new government's work . During this evening's news conference, president Cristiani said that during today's cabinet meeting it was decided to ask the legislative Assembly to decree 3 days of mourning for Dr Rodriguez Porth."

Roldan Betancur did not disclose any more details and merely confirmed that the Castroite ELN, which has staged several dynamite attacks against oil installations, did not accept the proposal made by President Virgilio Barco Vargas' government . Meanwhile, the M-19 sent a letter a few hours ago to Misael Pastrana Borrero, a former president and member of the opposition social conservative party, requesting that his party actively participate in a new peace initiative that formally began the 2d week of January . At that time, on behalf of the government, Rafael Pardo Rueda--the Presidential adviser for peace--and the top M-19 commander, Carlos Pizarro Leon Gomez, signed a preliminary agreement that contemplates the beginning of a direct dialogue between the guerrilla groups and spokesmen of the political parties represented in Parliament . However, the Farc, which declared a unilateral truce to Faciliate the beginning of the conversations, said that these agreements were``exclusive ,""as they were signed by only one of the country's rebel movements . The document signed by the government and the M-19 specifies that the tasks with all the Rebel organizations are conducted through the Simon bolivar national guerrilla coordinating board .

The meeting held at the Narino Palace was called so that Barco Vargas could report to the PSC on the development of the most recent events concerning the new peace process that began with the M-19 . According to some political circles, in this manner the path toward peace might be cleared, inasmuch as one of the``reservations""the PSC had was that the Barco Vargas government did not consult with the parties on the negotiations."

What this means is that the Presidents, as any rational people, feel it is more advantageous to conduct a process of dialogue without bombs and bullets . What else does the agreement say? it says the end of hostilities will permit a dialogue so that the Fmln will later abandon the armed struggle, disband as an armed group, surrender its weapons, and join Democratic and institutional life . by this, they--even Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega who signed the agreement--mean there is institutional life in El Salvador and democracy, which they are asking the Fmln to join .

There, you will see that the government is faithfully complying with what the five central American Presidents signed in the Tela accord, and that we are following up on the terms of the first dialogue in Mexico . What does the Fmln do in San Jose? first, drawing away from the agreement made in Mexico, it does not want to talk about ceasing hostilities . It introduces several proposals, which the Fmln claims are an expansion on the Mexico proposal, and presents several documents to the Salvadoran delegation . by the way, the Fmln also violates the Mexico pact by not respecting the discretion of the dialogue process .

The announcement made by President Alfredo Cristiani of the arrest of 45 soldiers and 2 officers for killing 6 clergymen, a maid, and her daughter, on 16 November is in itself a small and partial milestone . Cristiani, whose nationalist Republican alliance party was founded at the beginning of the eighties by individuals linked to paramilitary bands, the Army, and security Corps, asserted that the names of those responsible for the crimes will be released in the next 48 hours . Jesuist Francisco Estrada, who replaced father Jose Ignacio Ellacuria--one of those massacred--at the Rectorship of the central American University in San Salvador, warned that it is not enough to know which Sargent pulled the trigger but who gave him orders to do so needs to be revealed . Cristiani will not go that far . cosmetic sacrifices are made in order to neutralize the threat of U.S. Congress interrupting the $1.5 million it sends a day for the war against the Farabundo Marti National liberation front and the repression of the people . The dismissal of General Juan Rafael Bustillo as chief of the air forces and the possible punishment of some of the Counterinsurgent Atlacatl Battalion fulfill these requirements . However, Cristiani will attend the next informal summit of central American Presidents in Tegucigalpa, Honduras on 28 January under adverse conditions . The mobilization of the Latin American public opinion against the U.S . intervention in Panama and its aim of extending the intervention to other nations of the area have weakened Washington's diplomatic space . This could have an effect on its political ally of El Salvador which, in the previous summit held in December, presented Nicaragua and the Fmln as responsible for the worsening of the crisis in Central America .

1376,TST1-MUC3-0077,BOGOTA,,"Actually, that is not so, because while we are gathered here the tentacles of the drug trade are closing in on Europe and the Middle East . The Agggressive search for new markets does not respect oceans, just as it has not respected borders . anywhere there are consumers, there will be suppliers . In fact, cocaine is but one of the pernicious manifestations of the crisis of drug abuse, which is much broader . We must not delude ourselves . This scourge affects us all . acting in solidarity, as a community of nations, we must follow this plan of action: first, it is indispensable to effectively curb the demand for illegal drugs . drug abuse is the fuel that Propels Narcoterrorism . Today it is one of the most serious threats to Latin American democracies . cocaine users are contributing to the killing of my people by the criminal International drug trafficking organization . without any doubt, in any of the distinguished residential districts of this city, a habitual cocaine user may regard my assertion as an exaggeration . Nevertheless, his vice makes him a collaborator of the murderers who have killed many Colombian judges and policemen, who have sacrificed their lives to defend democracy and law . No weapon or tactic used in this struggle will be effective enough if it is not combined with resolute efforts to reduce the demand . The illegal profits are extremely large . I am certain that we will defeat the drug traffickers in Colombia, but someone in some other country, somewhere, will take over this business as long as it remains so profitable . This happened with marijuana . When it became too costly for the drug traffickers to operate in Colombia because of the effectiveness of the public forces, the traders in vice moved their plantations to California, to Hawaii, and to many other regions . The only law the drug runners do not violate is the law of supply and demand . No society, regardless of how wealthy it is, can afford the luxury of allowing its sons or daughters to poison themselves with cocaine, heroin, marijuana, or any other such deadly drugs . In this context, I wish to assert that President Bush's plan to curb the demand is a first step in the right direction . We must insist on the message that illegal drugs are not acceptable or harmless, whether they are consumed in the glittering parties of the rich or in the slums."

As we join efforts, as we strengthen our capabilities, and with the long tradition of democracy that we share, we can offer our contribution to strengthening our democracy . all the Democrats of the Americas who see in you, Mr. President Perez, a great fighter, are now celebrating a positive wave of legitimate elections, for example in Uruguay, Chile, Brazil, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua . very shortly Colombia and later Peru will hold elections . Panama, in turn, has called for popular consultation in the form of a referendum so that the people will decide on important constitutional reforms . throughout the Americas, democracy is the path and that is why it will be the adequate means for strengthening the OAS as a regional organization in which the various trends and ideologies within a common objective of searching for peace, freedom, liberty, and justice May and should be expressed and consulted on . There, the members will be able to discuss topics that affect us in a direct manner, such as International trade, foreign debt, and technical cooperation, as well as how to increase the scope of action with various Interlocutors, such as the case of Canada, the entry if which into the OAS we warmly welcome . Therefore, let us consider the reasons for this meeting which we do not hesitate in terming historic . The documents are evidence of how much we have advanced in specific achievements in the fields of energy, communications, transportation, and border transit; in joint programs in city planning such as the Cucuta-Villa El Rosario-San Antonio-Urena; in the Agro-Industrial and environmental sectors, and in Indian ethnic groups, customs, and education . all of these are topics we have discussed over the past few days with our respective teams . However, there is one topic that I wish to emphasize . There is an enemy who seeks to destroy the Integrationist and Democratic project . There are Anachronistic Redoubts of a subversive nature that are today Enfenced by our military forces and our hard working people . The enemy feels his days are numbered and he expresses himself though violent actions with kidnappings, extortion, and indiscriminate terrorism; by destroying oil pipelines and contaminating rivers, water basins, and lagoons . Our commissions have suggested positive means for working jointly on these rivers, water basins, and lagoons, and have signed an agreement that is already being implemented on oil spills and accidents . Colombian democracy will prevail over this internal enemy, and undoubtedly the integration programs will continue with renewed vigor . The technical management of the water Resouces, the electricity and telephone Interconnections, the feasibility studies for the various alternate routes that will connect us, the reopening of the bridges that were closed 30 years ago, the utilization of the Camilo Daza airport in Cucuta as an alternate airport for San Antonio, the agreement on fishing policies, the plans to increase crops ranging from sugarcane and cotton to Chiqui-Chiqui fiber are positive answers to those who insist on disrupting things . The International policy today not only understands the traditional concept and the preservation of national sovereignty, but above all, it points to people's well-being and increases their capabilities for consumption . It is not by blowing up oil pipelines or preventing the people who live along the river banks of both countries from fishing or by poisoning their crops that people's well-being will be achieved . I am sure that the San Pedro Alejandrino document we signed today is a gradual, but decisive step toward authentic Latin American integration . by the decision of their people and promoted by their rulers in this simple room where the Liberator died, we are today consolidating these bases that will not be destroyed and will prevent in the future any further frustrations of the dreams of the Liberator, bolivar . mixed commissions will be appointed shortly and will get down to work in what we still have yet to do . They will continue with a truly liberating task, that today--as from the times of the Congress of Angostura--is uniting our two nations . Thank you."

The declaration, which the Attorney General's office requested from the fourth penal court, did not provide details regarding evidence that could be used to solve the case of Monsignor Romero, who was a staunch critic of the government because of its alleged human rights violations . The document contains a list of the names of 12 Army officers and 12 civilians who were allegedly involved in plotting to oust the revolutionary government junta that took over in October 1979 after overthrowing general Humberto Romero . The list of plotters includes rightist deputy D'Aubuisson, founder of the Nationalist Republican alliance--the winner in the recent elections--and captain Alvaro Saravia, whom the President accused of being the Masterminds of the assassination of the clergyman . The list also includes the names of civilians involved in the kidnapping of several Salvadoran businessmen early in the decade . According to Duarte's declaration , 1ST infantry Brigade soldiers arrested the 24 coup plotters in 1980, and several documents were seized from them, including a notebook with plans for killing Romero .

We have made an effort so that the delegations can hold enough decision-making power for agreements to be reached as soon as possible . I said earlier that our proposal is aimed at achieving the country's real democratization . We have made an effort to achieve that goal . We are not asking the government to give up the legitimacy it says it has obtained in the elections . We are asking the government to submit it to a test for the sake of peace . If it passes the test, then it would reaffirm its power . Otherwise, we were always right to demand a new consensus for achieving peace in the country . On previous occasions they said that our proposals violated the Constitution . We have made a great effort, in spite of the fact that we do not recognize the Constitution because it was made to promote the war . The Constitution was drafted based on the killing of over 70,000 Salvadorans . The legislative assembly does not represent a large part of Salvadoran society, but we have made an effort so that there are no obstacles to reaching an agreement . We hope a new Constitution for peace can be drafted . that is why we are here, in spite of the fact that at the beginning the government Commission insisted on performing certain tasks which we thought should not have been carried out . We are concerned about the fact that the government has the wrong idea of what a dialogue is . We believe that to extend the dialogue in the current context, in the framework of the existing pressure in the country, is to extend the war . to hold a dialogue full of details and agreements of little importance is to extend the war."

We believe that for the dialogue to be resumed the government and the armed forces, mainly colonels Ponce and Elena, and Cristiani must specifically accept their responsibilities . We believe that once this situation and all the political actions for which they are responsible have been clarified .... they have to explain things very clearly because we are really tired of hearing the famous phrase that they always use; that is, that they are going to investigate . that is no longer possible; therefore, we are demanding that the situation be clarified . Meanwhile, we are going to talk to the observers and Mediators to check on how the situation is developing and at the same time to study the conditions for the dialogue - negotiation . I believe that the nature of the suspension has been well explained . These conditions must be met before we can, let us say, resume the meeting . It must be made very clear that the agreement to hold a dialogue, the continuity of the dialogue, has not been broken . This was agreed on by the two parties, and this is not what we are talking about . What we did was suspend the meeting that has created so many expectations . The San Jose agreement stated that there would be a cease-fire and a gradual process to put an end to hostilities that would lead to the end of the war; however, we believe that in order for this to be done, we must first have specific Democratic conditions . that is what Cristiani signed in Tela, Honduras .

They were led to believe that they were going along for a ride and that all the people would support them, and that the armed forces would not put up a fight . This, more than anything else, has been the harshest blow for the Fmln because the Salvadoran people rejected and spurned them when they tried to expose the people to so much danger and harm . It was also satisfactory to hear the many statements of support and solidarity given by so many Salvadorans . They have talked through the national network and every other means of communication, and have rejected and spurned the Fmln and its terrorist actions . Furthermore, the Ministry of interior and the ministries of Agriculture and economy are drafting a program to help the neighborhoods which have been affected by the Fmln's actions--once everything is calm--and to Resupply the Supermarkets and stores as quickly as possible .

Salvadoran people, we do not want to end this address without stating our deep gratitude for your--and the other Salvadoran people's--courageous attitude in the face of the Fmln aggression .

We know that the Fmln has failed, and now it is a matter of time before the armed forces manage to turn the situation around completely . Also, we want to state our deep gratitude to the friendly countries that have shown their support and solidarity--most of all their solidarity with you, the Salvadoran people--because there have been statements which, frankly, have filled us with emotion . for example, those of Costa Rica, the United Staes, Guatemala, and, in short, all the other countries that know perfectly well how irrational the Fmln's aggression is . They have realized that the government and the Republic, which are the result of the Salvadoran people's will, have begun a rational, peaceful, and democratic process to achieve peace in our country . to conclude, Salvadoran people, we request your support and understanding; but also your trust and serenity .

Duarte promised a social pact, a tolerant regime, economic and social reforms, and, most important of all, he promised peace . all of these promises were only a means of achieving Washington's great objective: to control the revolution in El Salvador or, in other words, Counterinsurgency . five years have passed since then . In reality 8 years have passed since El Salvador became the place where the Reagan era's models of Counterinsurgency, Neodictatorship, and Low-Intensity warfare were implemented . Washington's euphoria and optimism have completely vanished . The 19 March elections sealed the collapse of the Reagan administration's Salvadoran strategy . two basic factors are at the root of the U.S. failure: first, the United States sought Demagogic and politically Unsound reforms . Duarte did not in any way improve the masses' extreme poverty and isolation . Second, the revolutionary, popular, and democratic forces' qualitative and quantitative progress was possible because the problems that led to the conflict are--today more than ever--still unresolved . The 19 March elections resulted in an arena victory, and arena is the party that represents the most Ultraconservative Oligarchic sectors . Washington has returned to its starting point . The $3 billion spent on military advice and the genocide of tens of thousands of Salvadorans served no purpose whatsoever . It is all over . arena represents a return to the system used prior to 15 October 1979 . In other words, it is a return to dictatorial control of all political, economic, and military power . This is the end, the sad end of the Low-Intensity war exercise . U.S. general Harry Gordon summer, a member of the Santa Fe group, in his book on the mistakes the United States made in Vietnam, said the United States' concept of victory after its defeat in Vietnam can no longer be to achieve its enemy's unconditional surrender, as in World War II, but to achieve the political objectives for which it started the war . This is precisely the concept of victory used in Low-Intensity warfare . arena's victory, and the subsequent return to the old system, is obviously contrary to the objective of Low-Intensity warfare . for Washington, of course, this defeat means that $3 billion was squandered . for the Salvadoran people and central Americans, it means razed towns, devastated economies, and the death of 70,000 people . The new U.S. administration does not have a definite plan for El Salvador . what it has is an uncomfortable ally, arena, and a social time bomb about to explode . The Fmln believes the Bush administration should study the new situation in El Salvador and the entire world in a realistic and pragmatic manner .

In Lima alone, hundreds of members of polling station teams have asked to be relieved of this duty, petitions which for the most part have been refused by the the electoral court .

According to Peruvian law, if Vargas Llosa does not get absolute majority he will have to participate in a runoff election with the second-place candidate . Since it is quite certain that Vargas Llosa, the Presidential candidate of the Democratic front, will win the first round, the question now is who will be his rival for the Presidency in the second round . According to the surveys, the candidates with the best chance are Luis Alva Castro of the ruling American popular revolutionary alliance, with 19 percent of the votes; Alfonso Barrantes Lingan of the Socialist left, with 12 percent; and Henry Pease of the Communist left wing coalition United left, with 8 percent .

Spanish foreign minister Luis Yanez reported today that Spain has suspended aid to the Salvadoran government until the killings of the Spanish Jesuits, who had been living in our country for years, are resolved . This report represents a serious political setback for the Alfredo Cristiani government . The Spanish government's decision further isolates the Salvadoran government which is already under pressure because of calls in the United States for the suspension of military aid . This suspension represents a halt in the delivery of millions of dollars from the Spanish government to Salvadoran government . This represents International isolation .

She has described U.S. citizen Jennifer Casolo as an Erp member in charge of logistics . As has been reported, Casolo was released by a military judge after he determined that there was not enough evidence against her . Some groups, however, assert that Casolo was released due to political pressure from the United States, which threatened to launch a worldwide campaign to discredit El Salvador if Casolo was not released . Aguilar Marroquin was arrested at 1500 on 9 December after having participated in an attack on an urban public bus near Juan Pablo II Boulevard . The woman fled and sought refuge inside the facilities of the Salvadoran Alberto Masferrer University, where she took a group of students as hostages, threatening them with hand grenades . The police prevented her from doing anything and arrested her, confiscating one .45-Caliber pistol, bullets, cartridges, and two fragmentation grenades . Aguilar Marroquin said that she joined the Erp last March and that she was part of an urban commando called workers justice command . Aguilar added that she knows U.S. citizen Jennifer Casolo, who belongs to the Erp, and that Casolo used to meet with terrorist leader Fernando, workers justice command operations chief, near the National University school of dentistry . Aguilar added that Casolo was in charge of Erp logistics, especially lodging people and transporting arms and war equipment . The Erp had given her two Minibuses for her to carry out her tasks . In addition, Aguilar said that she believes Casolo had a leading position within the organization, because in addition to meeting with Fernando, she also met with an individual known as Mincho, who is the Political-Military Erp metropolitan chief and also the chief of the so-called urban Commandos . The prisoner knew about the existence of the arms in Casolo's house, because on various occasions Aguilar's chief, known as Miriam, told her about it . Other terrorists went to Casolo's house to get weapons, ammunition, and explosives to conduct their sabotage operations against buses, telephone distribution boxes, power Pylons, or to conduct large operations--as Aguilar described them--such as attacks on military Garrisons .

I therefore wanted to convey a message of hope and encouragement to every Chilean, to show them my feelings at this time of deep reflection . from the very moment I learned about this terrorist economic aggression, I ordered the creation of four ministerial commissions to tackle the problem . I also sent two ministers to the United States to meet with U.S. government officials . After tiring sessions of talks, these ministers managed to overcome a substantial part of the grape problem . The problem affecting other fruits remains to be solved . This new attack against the Chilean nation, an attack that destiny has placed in the nation's path of freedom, progress, and well-being, compels us to close ranks behind the government, unified and ready to fight--with courage and high spirit--the problem that faces us . on this occasion the country has seen how the countless threats to boycott the national economy have worked . Most of the time such threats have been promoted by certain politicians, labor leaders, or Communist labor unions, both at home and abroad . They are the ones who--driven by personal or ideological interest--have continually jeopardized the stability of workers, of families, and of those whom they Demagogically call their fellow countrymen . they do not care if they cause unemployment, poverty, and hunger to 500,000 fellow citizens who work in this agricultural activity . How Shamelessly they make claims and demands, offering their support and their solidarity when Chile is seriously threatened! yet when the danger is over, they change their attitude and again level charges against the government and criticize its actions . In doing that they fail to recall that from its very beginning the Chilean nation has been built upon Non-Negotiable principles because they are the essence of the National soul . gentlemen: our will is based on our feeling of unity in the face of adversity, whether from the action of nature or from the action of treacherous, disturbed minds that recognize no moral values, Fatherland, or law . Chileans: a few days ago I reported on the steps forward in the Institutionalization process and on the progress that our country has made in all fields . The fact that cyanide has been injected into two exported grapes has caused incalculable damage to the economy; it has also brought the shadow of anguish and uncertainty to thousands of homes of fellow countrymen whose jobs and, consequently, their legitimate right to a livelihood have been dramatically jeopardized . It is unfortunate that some officials of importing countries, without weighing the true effects of this type of measure, have restricted the import of Chilean fruits, thus provoking fear and distrust on the International consumer market . gentlemen, we must reverse this situation . We should once again act in a United manner to recover international confidence and our undisputed leadership as exporters . I am sure that we will succeed with a new joint effort."
1405,TST2-MUC4-0006,SAN SALVADOR,1990-04-22,"Dear radio audience: first of all, I want to thank you for allowing me to talk to you tonight about a very important issue for the future of our country . many times you have heard us mention the word solidarity . We have always used it as a word that means to think about those who suffer the most, those who have less . Indeed, those are the people we must help, even with our own sacrifice, and many times with a huge sacrifice by all of us . If love is the bond that unites family members, solidarity should be the great pillar, the cement that unites Salvadoran society, so that, United, we may fulfill our desire for peace, tranquility, happiness, and well-being . However, tonight allow me to give you two examples of what we consider should be the use of the word solidarity and what this word means in matters that are completely different from one another . a few weeks ago the government was forced, due to an increase in oil prices, to raise the price of oil byproducts such as gasoline, diesel, and all fuels . in the past, the government subsidized gasoline . Perhaps the government did this to make people believe this would have nothing but positive effects . However, let us analyze for a while the issue of increases in the price of fuel . When a government has no money for subsidizing, that means the cost of living will go up . There is no doubt that prices will rise when a government spends more than what it has . However, let us see how this aspect, or rather the principle of solidarity, applies to the increase in fuel prices, especially the price of gasoline . ten percent of all families in our country own a vehicle . In general, that 10 percent are those who have the most; in other words, those who have the possibility of buying a car, a vehicle . If we subsidized gasoline, what we would be doing is taking money out of a government that, for the time being, does not have such funds available . In order to get such funds, the government would have to impose new taxes which would affect all Salvadorans . Therefore, let us think whether or not it is fair that 90 percent of all Salvadoran families, who own no vehicles, must pay some kind of tax in order to benefit the other 10 percent who have the resources that allow them to buy a vehicle . We do not want to appear as Demagogic or populist with this example . What we want to say is that those of us who own a vehicle, who are part of the 10 percent lucky enough to have something and thus can buy a vehicle, must be in solidarity with that 90 percent who have little and many times nothing . They have no vehicles, and therefore have no reason to suffer so the gasoline we buy becomes cheaper . Moreover, to some extent the current price of gasoline makes it possible for the diesel supplied to urban and Interurban bus companies to be bought at a price that will allow bus owners to maintain the current bus fares . This is solidarity, and even more than that . those of us who have something, who own a vehicle, pay something--through the price of the gasoline we consume--so that those who own nothing and must use the public transportation buses can do so with no price increase . the same should be the case for the cost of liquid gas and propane gas, so that the prices of food cooked with gas in the Marketplaces are not increased . This is an example of how those of us who have something can show our solidarity with those who have little or nothing at all . I would now like to talk about an example of an even deeper kind of solidarity . I want to talk about peace . Salvadoran Brothers, this is the time when we must show our solidarity with those mothers who have lost their sons . We must show our solidarity with the innocent children who could kick a mine and end up without an arm or a leg . We must show our solidarity with those who, because of violence, cannot find a job . that is why this is the time for all of us to make an effort to achieve peace . Last Thursday I told you I felt more optimistic after meeting with the political parties and listening to their decision to accept the challenge to work for peace . They are determined to reach a consensus to fulfill the aspirations of all Salvadorans . We are beginning to sense what the near future of El Salvador could be . We are feeling happy and optimistic . However, I repeat, this is the time when we should all contribute to peace . anything that may lead to violence, whether it is Street disturbances or bombs, should not be permitted, because it is no longer conceivable for mothers, children, and families to continue to suffer in our country . the time has come to show our solidarity, to search, not only through words but also through our examples and actions, for the peace that our country and Salvadorans deserve . Therefore, our solidarity should be the fundamental tool for our country's reconstruction . It should be the fundamental tool for the physical and spiritual reconstruction of all Salvadorans . We want all Salvadorans, without exception, to support the peace efforts, so that those who suffer so very much from violence will no longer suffer . This is a fundamental step forward for the freedom and democracy of the Salvadoran people . Salvadoran Brothers, let us show our solidarity in this crucial time in our history, because we have always known that when all Salvadorans act positively like Brothers, we can come out ahead . This is all for tonight . Thank you all very much and may God bless you."

1408,TST2-MUC4-0009,RIO DE JANEIRO ,,"Lawyer Carlos Oldiney reported the gang and Federal agents Valdemir Lopez Prazeres and Luis Jose Da Conceicao and detectives Paulo Massanhyo and Carlos Angel Serrano Castilesso were arrested . Cambaralamaia's organization is just one of the many gangs in the region that deals with Bolivian cocaine . Another gang is led by Gerson Palermo, of Umuarama, Parana state, who controls the exchange of cocaine to Paraguay for stolen Brazilian cars . Palermo owns four Twin-Engined Cessna planes and employs more than 200 men . He also exchange cars for cocaine in Bolivia . Although sentenced by the Brazilian courts, Palermo lives in Pedro Juan Caballero, Paraguay, where he maintains business contacts with the Bolivian Coca producers . Palermo obtains ether and acetone, which are essential for refining the drug, from Argentina . The Federal police believes that the drug might be refined in Mato Grosso do Sul, near some residences in the Dourados and Campo Grande sectors . Palermo exchanges the chemicals for tons of cocaine paste which, in the opinion of regional Federal police delegate Francisco Viana Queiroz, is also processed in Paraguay . Viana Queiroz maintains that the drug is refined by a group of traffickers led by Arsenio Benitez Gonzalez, who is known as Vilhar and who lives in Asuncion . The Federal police believe that Vilhar--who is believed to be Palermo's partner--is the Brazilian traffickers' main cocaine supplier . According to the police, two drug routes pass through Mato Grosso do Sul: the Ponta pora route, and the Corumba route, which passes through the Bolivian town of Puerto Suarez . Many traffickers come to this Bolivian town, most of them small suppliers who only want to exchange cocaine for cars that were stolen in Brazil . According to the authorities, the Corumba route is more important because it channels the so-called``Mini-Traffic .""this involves hundreds of people who, together, make up a sizable quantity of drugs every day . The cars are the hard currency used in these transactions . Most of them are taken to Bolivia after having been stolen in Sao Paulo . They follow the same route as the Bolivian cocaine, that is, via Puerto Suarez . The most important part of the trafficking, however, is carried out in Paraguay and Bolivia . Gerson Palermo is responsible for part of it, while the rest is shared by hundreds of Bolivian traffickers . Palermo obtains ether and acetone from Formosa, Argentina . He takes these chemicals aboard small planes to the towns of Pilar or Encarnacion, in Paraguay . from there, another group takes the 200-Liter drums along the Chaco highway to Puerto Guarani, in Bolivia . Bolivian traffickers take care of the rest of the journey to Santa Cruz de la Sierra . In return, Palermo receives cocaine paste which is shipped to Asuncion and, from there, to Pedro Juan Caballero for distribution to the processing units . It is believed that the traffickers use some ranches near Porto Murtinho, near the Paraguayan town of Bahia Negra, to process large quantities of cocaine . No cocaine paste is usually available along the Corumba route . The drug is refined because it is relatively easy to find ether and acetone in Corumba, where the Federal police have failed to reduce the large demand for such chemicals in retail stores . dozens of drugstores sell those products by the liter, and this is not forbidden by law . The authorities estimate that production in the Puerto Suarez region nears 300 kg per week, which is transported by railroad, air, and land . in an attempt to evade the Federal police, traffickers have tried to transport the drug inside their bodies, in wine Demijohns, and even in children's diapers . These traffickers generally travel by bus or by train . over the past 6 months the police caught dozens of traffickers using these methods . Now, however, only with the complicity of the police can cars carrying Bolivian cocaine produced in the Puerto Suarez region reach Campo Grande."
1409,TST2-MUC4-0010,NO CITY,,"Mr. President, when one SEES Peru facing the difficulties it is experiencing now, the same as our own country and Latin America in general, one asks himself: would a man, a novelist like Mario Vargas Llosa, be the right man to lead Peru? as president of all Peruvians--and of Vargas Llosa to even if he does not like it--I cannot pass judgment, either ethically or intellectually, on a politician and Peruvian who is contending for the Presidency . What are you going to do after you step down from the Presidency? well, I am going to be free . Why do you not come to Colombia and I am sure...sure, I accept your invitation, and I hope some COLOMBIANS will extend it . However, I want to tell you very honestly, that I am perhaps better at selling dreams, ideas, and doctrines than at administering a situation of penury, like the one our countries are experiencing, and most particularly Peru, which is one of the poorest countries in Latin America . It is very difficult . for instance, on a day when the price of rice or chicken goes up, the people will not believe you, even if you tell them the greatest of truths . One can be preaching something very important, but if it failed to rain and the city had no water no one will believe of you the greatest of all truths . Then, when one stops being president and administering penury, one can devote oneself to convincing people, to educating . that is what I should do . Now, why did you make that aside, making me president of all Peruvians, even of Vargas Llosa? whether he likes or not it hurts him . because I am sure that some people would not like to have me as President . Even him, for instance? I did not say so . I do not know . I never fall to the level of defining people or pointing out last names . I make an outline or define them in the negative . Mr. President, this dialogue for your generosity and kindness . addressing our people and our country, , how were things today at the summit? very well . COLOMBIANS, who have seen their institution threatened, their press abused, and many politicians also threatened, must have confidence that Latin America, together with the United States, will confront the problem of drug trafficking . This is not only a problem for Colombia . It is our problem too, and we will tackle it . The day a newspaper was blown up in Bogota I came to Bogota because I felt that freedom of the press was threatened on the continent . After all, we are Latin Americans . Let COLOMBIANS have confidence."

The newspaper stated that the alleged rift between the military officers began once it was discovered who was responsible for the death of six Jesuit priests, in which one Colonel, two lieutenants, and six soldiers are being charged . Colonel Ponce said that the relations with U.S. advisers--about 52 in the country--are very cordial . Our relations with the North Americans are normal as usual . The U.S. advisers have helped us very much in the Professionalization of the armed forces, and they continue working with us . where do you think these wire reports stating there are Rifts between Salvadoran military officers and U.S. advisers have Orginiated? I do not know; I cannot understand . There are always those who try to break the strategic alliance between the Salvadoran government and armed forces and the United States . This is a poor country that depends a great deal on U.S. economic and military aid . following the murder of the Jesuits, what are relations like between the Salvadoran military and the Gringo advisers? as usual, these relations are very cordial, and they continue to work with us . As you can see, two advisers are here with me now at the table presiding over the event . the same has been the case with all the units in the country's interior . I fail to see any difference in relations before and afterward . The military chief repeated the need to maintain the state of emergency, not only due to the guerrilla attacks, but also to keep control over the organization fronts just prior to an expected wave of protests on the latest government economy measures . We must start thinking what may happen to domestic order in the face of the economic measures that have been issued or are planned . We must think what the reaction of the people or the Fmln organization fronts will be, as they always use any excuse to disrupt domestic order . It would be good to look into what is needed to maintain domestic order in the country . The High-Ranking military officer gave these statements at the ceremony to turn over command of the captain general Gerardo Barrios military Academy . The new commander is Colonel Ricardo Alfonso Casanova Sandoval, who replaces Colonel Guillermo Alfredo Benavides Moreno, removed from his post after being accused of ordering the murder of the Jesuit priests . Meanwhile, Colonel Hector Heriberto Hernandez has been appointed commander of the 6th infantry Brigade based in Usulutan, and in La Union Department the change of command ceremonies of the armed forces military training center have taken place, where Colonel Francisco Arturo Lopez will be in command replacing Colonel Carlos Alfredo Rivas, who has been transferred to the joint Chiefs of staff."

The following people were aboard the Ecuadoran flagship: U.S. citizen Scott Heyndal, Ecuadoreans Luis Antonio Meneses Benavides and Edwin Rodrigo Teneda Parreno, and Colombian pilot Julio Torres . Mr. Torres was killed and Mr. Meneses was wounded . The attackers, who wore field uniforms of the Colombian military, boarded the Ecuadoran vessel, and, after noticing that Mr. Meneses was wounded, gave him 100,000 Colombian pesos and then left him and Mr. Torres' body . The attackers returned to Colombia taking Heyndal and Teneda with them . They crossed the border and sailed upriver for about two and a half hours on the Rumiyacu River . The attackers spent the evening at a camp near the river and forced Mr. Heyndal to write letters to his boss at the mining project, Mr. Jeff Sino, also a U.S. citizen, and to his wife . Those letters were given to Mr. Teneda, who received 20,000 Colombian pesos . He was then ordered to return to Ecuador and given instructions for delivering the letters."

The soldiers had a communications relay station in the building . as a result of the attack, there were 20 casualties . Among the casualties is a lieutenant who was the unit chief, and two sergeants . The communications equipment was totally destroyed . The situation is not as the Fascist Cristiani reported it to be . He said there was only one soldier at the hospital receiving medical treatment . that is totally false . The building housed a Garrison not a hospital, because a Dmifa unit and a communications relay center were there . It was a Garrison . We are going to correct our report on the results of the attack on the Dmifa unit : 20 soldiers were killed and 10 were wounded . In all, there were 30 casualties, including two sergeants and the unit chief . We repeat: in an impressive attack on a military position at Santa Teresa hospital--the building was no longer a hospital but an Army communications center--our Figthters Annihilated and destroyed that position . The Army sustained 20 killed and 10 wounded . The communications relay station was totally destroyed."

1415,TST2-MUC4-0016,SAN SALVADOR,1990-05-03,"Although it organically depends on the executive branch, the Commission is an official justice organization and the judge can instruct it or request that it investigate X, Y, or Z, in addition to what it submitted when the case was passed over to the judge . Pablo Guillermo . Mr. President, the newspaper La Jornada of Mexico stated yesterday that Colonel Orlando Zepeda had left the country this weekend with all his family and with a considerable amount of luggage, which would indicate that he did not go on a mere vacation . I would like to know the official version of this . You say he left when? yesterday . Well, only if he left very hurriedly after midday . I was with him here yesterday discussing other things, as well as military matters with the defense minister and deputy ministers . He was present . unless he may have left . I doubt it very much, because I had a meeting with them to see the order of the month on Saturday and he was present . pardon me, that was Tuesday when we had the order for the end of the month . I understand he was present at the commanders meeting . If he left last weekend, it must have been for the weekend and he returned on Monday . Maria Cortina, Notimex . Mr. President, in what way would a cut in military aid affect the peace process? we are currently seeing opposite signs from the Fmln in terms of wanting to truly put an end to violence . a sign of this was the night of 1 may when the attacks were carried out . This would indicate that, although not all the Fmln command, that is the five groups, some groups seem to resist a political solution and favor a military solution, as they have insisted on pursuing for 10 years . those groups could view a cut in military aid as a sign of weakening of the government and the armed forces, and that consequently they would have a better chance of being successful following the military path . that could increase the potential of a military solution in the minds of some . This could reduce the potential of seriously considering a political solution to the conflict . Raul Monge, Cadena radio Centro . Mr. President, how do you view the guerrillas' morale at this moment? well, I obviously cannot but believe that the morale of the guerrillas after the offensive must have dropped Considerbly . This is especially so since there was a large sacrifice on their part in the form of casualties and the fact that the offensive did not represent a success, despite their claim that it was only a show of force, which is a lot of Malarkey . all the prior documents indicated that this was a large-scale operation to the hilt seeking to overthrow the government and to crown a military victory . What I believe was of even greater impact was that they realized that the people of El Salvador do not support them and do not support the path of violence . in that sense, their hopes of a popular insurrection were shattered . on the contrary, the people did not support the Fmln and instead turned their backs on them and showed that they do not support violence . This must have caused an impact on the Fmln and its members . I recently read in a Venezuelan newspaper statements by a commander, whose pseudonym is Gustavo, who said that they were tired of following the path of violence and that a solution had to be found . This demonstrates that some of their ranks are getting tired of the military path . These are indications of what could be . What I want to clear up once and for all is that we do not react to whether or not the Fmln feels strong or feels weak . We know that 100 terrorists in a country can cause destruction and death and that is what we are trying to avoid, although 100 terrorists are not a force that will destabilize a government . However, the damage that they cause is such that we do not want it to continue."

1417,TST2-MUC4-0018,CLANDESTINE,1989-11-12,"We are receiving a report right now on the situation in San Salvador . The report says that San Salvador neighborhoods and residential areas are still under the control of the Farabundo Marti National liberation front . Armed Forces official sources have admitted that some areas of San Salvador are controlled by the Fmln . The report adds that as of 2140 on 12 November, there was still tension in the city . Some sporadic shooting was still heard, and the situation in various parts of the capital city indicated that our comrades are maintaining their positions, they are carrying out military engineering tasks, opening trenches, and setting up barricades with the cooperation of the San Salvador people . press agency reports note that there is great tension in the capital city, and apparently they are expecting here is a news agency report which says that early this morning, less shooting was heard because apparently each side had Consolidated their position . that is what some press agencies are reporting . We have also observed that the armed forces have admitted that some areas in the capital city are controlled by the Fmln . There are many vehicles scattered all over the streets of San Salvador . that is the report we have received from San Salvador, where our fighters in Zacamil and other neighborhoods and residential areas in the capital city are now receiving the support of the people who are Fortifying themselves in neighborhoods . We call on the San Salvadoran youths to go out tonight to cooperate with the Fmln fighters . make the assassins of Msgr Romero pay dearly for every step they take against the people in the neighborhoods in San Salvador city . It has been 24 , 25, nearly 26 hours since the Fmln fighters established their positions in San Salvador in view of the regime's incompetence . The regime has clearly said that it is incapable of controlling the situation, as it has had to decree a state of siege that began on the evening of 12 November in San Salvador . Another evidence of the government's weakness is the gag placed on the media . The government has not allowed the media to broadcast its Newscasts . Why doesn't the government want the people to listen to Newscasts in El Salvador? What is the Cristiani regime hiding? this is a question that the people are asking; they want to know the answer . The government is afraid, it does not want to inform the people about the developments or the scope of the actions carried out by the Fmln throughout the National territory . comrade fighters: We have already told you; this is in the bag . your courage and determination to win has made it possible to carry out the Fmln plan as our communique issued by the general command has said . comrades: keep it up, keep an open eye, keep up the high morale as you have done up to now, seek contact with the people, receive their cooperation in the fortifications that are being made throughout San Salvador . Let's go to the top and that's it."
1418,TST2-MUC4-0019,SAN SALVADOR,1989-06-26,"President Alfredo Cristiani said today that despite the Farabundo Marti National liberation front's terrorist attacks against Salvadorans, his government is willing to hold talks with the rebels . He said that his administration is continuing its efforts to form a Commission for a dialogue with the rebels and that he is now awaiting word from two people whom he has chosen to serve on the Commission . The Catholic Church will not be represented on the Commission because the Commission is completely political in nature . President Cristiani condemned the murder of national fire Department director Colonel Roberto Armando Rivera Escobar, who was killed in a machinegun attack this morning . President Cristiani attributed Rivera's murder to the Fmln: it is clear that the Fmln does not want peace but instead wants to continue the violence . The Fmln committed this crime . I believe that a treacherous crime such as this one cannot be called anything but a cowardly act . We will, of course, investigate the crime . I repeat, however, that all the evidence we have gathered on the Fmln's plans indicate that it was responsible for this action . What are you doing to prepare the Commission that is to hold talks? the terrorists will not of course be successful with actions of this kind and will not provoke us into violent action . They should understand by now that the government is searching for peace and wants to achieve peace within El Salvador's legal framework and by applying the law . The Fmln rebels should understand that their terrorist actions will not lead us to take rash actions; it is useless for them to continue to act in this way . We are continuing our work on setting up the Commission . Today we will speak with two people who have still not told us if they will accept my invitation to be Commission members . The names of the Commission members will be released to the public once the Commission is fully formed . The Catholic Church's role in this Commission? the Catholic Church will not be represented in this Commission because it is a political Commission and not one in which the church can effectively participate . the church has always worked for peace and has made all possible efforts to find peace for the country the church will continue to work toward this goal . However, I believe that the church has a different role to play in the search for peace, and that role is not serving on the political Commission . What would you say is the biggest obstacle you have encountered in the month that you have served as President? I believe that the biggest obstacle has been our inability to launch our government program, which is due to the state of affairs existing in the former administration when we took over . We have repeatedly observed this state of affairs in the majority of government . Throughout government offices, disorder was rampant, and, in many cases, we have observed that government offices were managed Irresponsibly . Moreover, the nation's public finances have greatly deteriorated . We have inherited a country in very bad financial shape, and, I believe, this has delayed the launching of our government program . Cristiani, referring to Costa Rican President Oscar Arias' offer to hold a dialogue with the rebels in Costa Rican territory, said that the offer was a great contribution toward convincing the Fmln to stop murdering defenseless citizens."

What can the popular movement do? I believe that the Cristiani government is closing all the roads to a peaceful solution of this conflict . through repression it is closing off the possibility of labor unions and associations resolving their problems peacefully . The government is closing off the possibility of negotiations . The Army and the Cristiani government are opposed to true negotiations . The people have no alternative . In El Salvador there is a latent path, the path of armed actions . at this moment, as this government increases repression, armed actions become increasingly legitimate, armed actions to find solutions to the conflict, armed actions to stop the repression by the regime . The workers and their associations and labor unions are entitled to defend themselves and their labor benefits . defense is legitimate . It is legitimate for the workers to decide to defend themselves the armed way, through violence . It is the Cristiani government, Ponce, and the high command who are leaving the workers no alternative . to conclude, commander: in recent hours there have been attacks in the capital, including bomb attacks on the residences of democratic leaders such as Ruben Zamora and Aronete Diaz, an attack on the residence of Colonel Carranza, and an attack on a relative of Colonel Lopez Huila, among others . The Armed Forces and the government have publicly said that the Fmln is responsible for these attacks . Our armed actions are highly just and have political motivations . Our objectives are strictly military . all our guerrilla units function according to this principle, be it in the rural areas or in the cities where our urban Commandos operate . The attack on the armed forces staff installations and other operations against military targets are our responsibility . The Fmln's policy is not to attack relatives of military men or politicians . The high command has been trying to confuse the people here and abroad . What is its objective? to cover up its repressive policy . It is escalating its actions . It has gone from the selective capture and murder of leaders to mass arrests, and from mass arrests it has moved into genocide and indiscriminate attacks . It is clear that its objective is the social organizations . The government said it in San Jose . It is evident that the high command is trying to create confusion, but the people abroad and we know that our actions are aimed at military objectives."

The caller identified himself as John Jairo Arias Tascon . He called the Caracol network in Medellin to denounce that the charges against the Medellin cartel are part of a plan to blame them for all violent actions in the country . The authors of the assassination are sectors who seek to destabilize the country, Arias Tascon added . Pizarro, former leader of the 19 April movement, the guerrilla group that laid down its weapons on 9 March, was killed by the impact of three bullets fired at him aboard a Colombian Avianca flight that was en route to the city of Barranquilla along the country's Atlantic coast . after the crime, at 1100, an individual who identified himself as Sapatoca called Caracol to report that the killing had been ordered by Fidel Castano and Henry Perez, heads of the extreme rightist paramilitary Militias . Sapatoca added that Castano and Perez perpetrated the crime following orders from the Extraditables . Castano was connected to the death of Bernardo Jaramillo, also a presidential candidate, for the leftist patriotic Union, on 22 March, although at that time it was reported that Castano headed a paramilitary organization that did not implicate the Extraditables . on that occasion Pablo Escobar, leader of the Extraditables and the Medellin cartel, denied that the drug traffickers had killed Jaramillo . A confidential report drafted recently by the administrative Department of security, said that some Army and police members cooperate with Castano's criminal organization . Navarro Wolff, number two leader of M-19, told newsmen today after Pizarro was killed that his burial must be attended by all the country, because we must repudiate crime such as this . Navarro Wolff said that Pizarro's death shows that the country is in turmoil and that it will be very difficult to rebuild the country . There is no space except for pain and for IRE, he added . The burial of Carlos must be peaceful, as was M-19's example of peace given to the country, he added . It is hard to explain how things such as this occur when the M-19 and Carlos Pizarro were setting an example of prudence, tolerance, and understanding, Navarro said . Pizarro, a former guerrilla commander who led his armed group toward demobilization after 17 months of political negotiations with the government of Virgilio Barco, told newsmen before boarding the aircraft: We are doing well . This was a reference to the M-19 electoral campaign . Pizarro stated in his last public statement: I am certain that we will know how to wage opposition . We will engage in a very pretty Democratic play with regard to the next government . We will participate in building new Colombian democracy .

1426,TST2-MUC4-0027,SAN SALVADOR,1989-12-06,"Colonel, what specific measures have been taken against the missiles? I believe that specific measures we have adopted have given us good results . They have launched four Sa-7's in the Zacatecoluca area; however, our pilots have skillfully avoided the rockets or missiles, which did not hit their aircraft . We are adopting measures that are giving results . We must also clarify that we feel that since the light aircraft transporting these missiles did not have a normal landing and the missiles were not in their original package, it is possible that they suffered some functional damage when the plane crashed south of Zacatecoluca . Thank God, do you think that the summit of central American Presidents can open new possibilities for resuming talks with the Fmln? do you think that this summit could bring about new steps toward a dialogue? Yes, I think that the Salvadoran government since the beginning of the year has opened this possibility and is willing to talk on a permanent basis . I think that at this time it would be a positive step in the political field . However, in the military field, where the Fmln has attacked us in an irrational and violent way in the main cities, the armed forces is replying, and we will continue to reply . We will completely defeat the Fmln . based on the information we have received from our units, we have inflicted 1,902 dead , 1,209 wounded, and 44 terrorists have deserted and turned themselves in to the authorities . We have confiscated a large number of weapons . I will give you the quantities : 25 Antiaircraft missiles--one red eye and 24 Sa-7's--915 rifles , 12 carbines , 11 Shotguns , 156 grenade and rocket launchers , 49 mortars , 45 Machineguns , 41 submachineguns , 67 Revolvers and pistols , 23 radios, and a large amount of explosives . I must stress that the Fmln has gathered all these weapons with Suppport from abroad . It is a large arsenal . I must also note that many of the weapons we found had been abandoned, which means that the Fmln has had many Desertions . We have also found weapons in houses, thanks to the collaboration of the civilian population . We have also learned that the Fmln has kidnapped a large number of youths here in the San Salvador area and mainly in Usulutan, as well as in Chalatenango . This means that they are trying to fill in the number of casualties they have suffered with youths . This also means that their efficiency will be very low . I do not know if you have seen over the past few days a leaflet issued by the Air Force, which was dropped from airplanes and also distributed on the streets . The leaflet URGES Salvadoran patriots to defend their homeland, their properties, and lives . It also says that if necessary, terrorists must be killed, as well as their internationalist allies . What is your opinion of this leaflet? is it not an invitation to kill foreigners in this country? I do not think so, because the leaflets mention internationalists, who are fighting along with the Fmln."

Within this framework, we have: the siege on the National University, threats against teachers and political organizations, and increasing repression against the peoples' movement . 2 . The attack is clearly intended to cause unrest among the participants of the International peace and solidarity conference of sister trade unions that began today at the Uca . 3 .

Botero said that initial investigations have revealed that Escobar Gaviria planned and ordered the attack on Jaramillo Ossa . Gen. Botero told reporters that the Medellin cartel contracted the services of an organization of hired assassins and sent them to Bogota to assassinate the up leader . He added that Escobar Gaviria ordered the delivery of an initial sum of 300,000 pesos to a third person after the crime was committed at El Dorado airport's pedestrian Overpass in Bogota . The defense minister said that minutes after the killing the Das intelligence service intercepted an Escobar Gaviria conversation in Medellin . He was ordering his accomplices to pay 300,000 pesos to a third person linked to the paid assassin who killed the up leader . Botero also disclosed that the assassin is a 16-year-old youth who carried a false identification card under the name of Jairo Alberto Restrepo Posada . Meanwhile, anonymous calls were received by various Bogota media today . The callers were attributing the attack on up leader Jaramillo Ossa to a so-called Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha commando group . In these calls, it was said that the Medellin cartel decided to resume the war because for five months it offered to negotiate with the Virgilio Barco Vargas government, and the only response it received was to urge cartel members to turn themselves in to justice . In addition, threats were made against other Colombian political figures such as liberal party candidate Cesar Gaviria Trujillo . The callers said that the Extraditables released kidnapped people, delivered Laboratories, and large quantities of dynamite as proof of their intention to talk, but they never received a reply from the government . The callers said: We are going to turn ourselves in, but we will be dead when we do so .

Guerrero, who was an adviser to the governmental Commission for support to the dialogue, was shot to death by terrorists at the intersection of Boulevard de Los heroes and Alameda Juan Pablo II . what they are showing is that they are bent on carrying out totally destructive actions to lower the confidence of the population and to provoke general panic . I think that although as a government we have always maintained a conciliatory position to attain peace in El Salvador, we must also make a firmer decision to take stronger action . The people who commit these wanton actions are deranged people . they do not understand words . they do not understand that they must respect a legal system, or a democratic process or one of Humanization . They are simply beasts and murderers and must be treated as such . Merino said the murderers must be punished with the full weight of the laws, and that one of the terrorists who was wounded and captured at the site of the crime is under interrogation . one of the criminals was wounded . This will obviously enable us to obtain some clues as to the identity of the actual killers and of the Masterminds of this new murder, which has shocked Salvadoran society . as in previous cases, we are conducting investigations in this case . However, I repeat that the time has come for us to take a firmer stand, to do our utmost, and to realize that if nothing has happened to us thus far, it does not mean we will not fall victim to these murderers . It is better to take precautions now than to have regrets later .

Deputy Prime Minister Yitzhaq Navon said that the government must put an end to the disgrace caused by some Israelis .

We only know that they belong to an institution, and this of course is only partial information . did you know that the government was going to make this announcement last night, or was it a surprise? I think it was a surprise because we had been in touch with the President and with the crime Commission, which is the one carrying out the investigations on orders from the President and the government . They promised us that if we were to cooperate by providing information, they would do everything possible to resolve the problem and carry out the investigations . At that point I was skeptical, because the persons who have testified have accused the armed forces, and I had never seen a Salvadoran President or the armed forces making a serious effort to clean up its image and carry out Investigtions to put members of the armed forces in prison . I was skeptical . I had never seen that happen, but facts show that I was mistaken . father Estrada has admitted that there has been international pressure to have this case investigated, but he optimistically believes that the decision to investigate has been adopted also for the sake of the prestige of the armed forces . I am inclined to believe that the armed forces are acting not only as a result of pressure, but also because they could be denied military or economic aid . I believe that a crime such as the one being investigated goes against the very essence of the armed forces, which exists to protect the citizens, not to harm them . father Estrada said he trusts in the moral strength of President Cristiani to see this case through to the end .

1471,TST2-MUC4-0072,LIMA,,"I believe that the climate of flexibility is embracing the entire political, military, and economic world system and that the banks will have to be content with collecting less than what they originally thought . There was a triumphant presentation of an offer to reduce a country's debt by up to 20 percent, but as far as we know that offer has not materialized . Furthermore, a 20-Percent reduction is not significant, not great enough to solve the problems of poverty and the financial obligations of Latin America . The reduction must be much greater . a reduction of 10 or 20 percent will do little; everything will remain the same . We believe--and I have been saying this to every Latin American President--that only through our adoption of firm and dignified positions will the adversary relent . Let me now say a few words about a different subject, the establishment of relations with North Korea . I believe the opposition has raised a tempest in a Teacup; it has raised an issue that is of no relevance to the Peruvian people . First, we uphold the concept of universality of relations, of maintaining relations with all nations . Colombian President Virgilio Barco established relations with North Korea a few months ago; he did not have to face a savage opposition telling him that he was throwing himself into the arms of terrorism . Nobody has complained to Carlos Andres Perez or to Salinas de Gortari about maintaining relations with North Korea . for that matter, nobody has objected in Bolivia, Austria, or Sweden, because in those countries there is no reactionary right to argue that to recognize North Korea is to court destruction . Second, someone--and I do not want to mention him by name--has said that relations have been established with a terrorist state . This is a tremendous error, because 20,000 rifles sold to us by North Korea at $90 apiece--$ 10 less than anywhere in the world--have made it possible to save and defend the lives of tens of thousands of civilian guards from the national police and have made it possible to eliminate and eradicate subversion in many parts of the country . Third, international relations are not designed to be auctioned off to the highest bidder . If so we would have to break relations with Australia or with Finland . One must maintain relations with all the peoples of the world . Under such criteria, since Peru recognizes the Frg, it should close its embassy in the Communist GDR . This Manichean criterion, this Obtuse criterion, this outmoded criterion is no longer valid; the Berlin Wall has been razed . How can one say that this country should be recognized and another shouldn't? Peru will not accept any imperialist veto on its world relations . We have had enough of the 1960's and 1970's when Passports said we could not travel to the Soviet Union or Cuba . Peruvians have the right to travel wherever they wish, like they wish, and when they wish . This is freedom, and it cannot be curtailed by the establishment of Off-Limits areas around the globe . Finally, several of the gentlemen who now oppose the establishment of relations with North Korea have been honored, illustrious guests of the North Korean government . The other day I heard some people speaking vehemently on this topic, while some other people nearby had been honored guests there . journalists can seek out and determine how many of those who now oppose these relations have been honored guests in North Korea for weeks . Now, for political reasons, they are opposed to the establishment of relations with North Korea."

1473,TST2-MUC4-0074,CLANDESTINE,,"The main reason for coming up with this version was to Masterminds of the crime to find out who the Perpetrators were . with this version, Cristiani and the high command are trying to come up with extenuating circumstances for the trial and to place the responsibility for the assassination of the Jesuits on Mid-Level military officers . The colonels who were involved in the crime could be set free and their responsibility would only be related to the fact that the crime was committed within an area under their command . This version of the crime is aimed at leaving the armed forces high command free from any responsibility and to only slightly touch the members of La Tandona, especially Col Orlando Cepeda, who was the one who signed the order to assassinate the Jesuits, and Col Rene Emilio Ponce, chief of staff . Col Guillermo Benavides, who is a member of little importance within La Tandona, was indirectly involved in the crime . However, the is self-evident . The decision to carry out an operation to kill popular and religious Democratic leaders was made by the general staff of the armed forces 4 days after the Fmln offensive began . This operation was part of a complete Counteroffensive plan of the armed forces, which included the massive use of all the firepower of the Air Force against poor neighborhoods and the killing of democratic people's movement and church leaders . Alfredo Cristiani, who was taken to the headquarters of the general staff for security reasons and assumed control of the defense plan, was fully aware of the genocide plan . U.S. officers and advisers were also at the general staff headquarters at the time to discuss and approve this genocide plan . The plan was implemented on the evening of 16 November . All labor union offices in San Salvador were looted . The offices of humanitarian organizations, political parties, and religious centers were also looted . The plan was implemented at the installations of the Uca . The days that followed saw a continuation of the arrests, Persecutions, and assassinations . The offices of all the were attacked . its leaders were forced to seek refuge or to leave the country to escape this manhunt . This is a policy for which the high command and Alfredo Cristiani are directly responsible . The U.S . Ambassador and U.S. Embassy personnel are fully aware of this . The need to come up with this version comes from the precarious predicament that the government and the armed forces have found themselves in in view of the debates taking place in the U.S. Congress to decide the fate of aid to El Salvador, which is linked to the results of the investigation of the assassination of the Jesuit priests on 16 November."

However, the fighters for``freedom ,""`` democracy ,""and``human rights""in Western nations have kept quiet out of fear of the naked aggression and the way of the tyrant . On 20 December 1989, several tens of thousands of U.S . troops, equipped with the most up-to-date weapons, brazenly intruded into Panama, toppling the Noriega government and forcing Manuel Antonio Noriega to be tried in the United States . This U.S. act was by no means less than the Soviet act of invading Czechoslovakia and kidnapping its leaders at that time . The new Panamanian government estimated that the U.S . invasion had resulted in the deaths of at least 600 Panamanian soldiers and civilians and made several tens of thousands of people homeless . more than 5,000 military and administrative personnel of the former government were arrested by U.S . troops, and Panama suffered economic losses of $10 billion . The United States openly manipulated the work of establishing a new Panamanian government, national defense Army, police force, and other state Apparatuses, so much so that it rushed in and raided the embassies of other countries in Panama or diplomatic apartments, and detained the diplomatic officials of other countries . Under the powerful pressure of world opinion, some of the U.S . troops have withdrawn from Panama, but the U.S. government still refuses to pull out all its troops . Just after its intrusion into Panama, the U.S. government immediately announced, as scheduled, the dispatch of a strong fleet of warships into the Caribbean, close to the coast of Colombia, for what was called an antidrug maneuver, Intercepting planes and vessels for trafficking in drugs . On 5 January this year, the United States, ignoring the strong opposition of Latin American nations, ordered a fleet of four warships, including the aircraft carrier``Kennedy""and Nuclear-Propelled cruiser``Virginia ,""to sail toward the Caribbean to``combat drug smuggling .""such a High-Handed way of ignoring the sovereignty and will of Latin American nations and forcing the deployment of troops in front of the gates of other countries evoked fierce reactions in Colombia and other Latin American nations . Jaramillo Ossa, a presidential candidate from the Colombian patriotic Union, noted that the United States``very nearly""invaded Colombia . The Colombian government also warned the U.S. government: without the authorization of the government of President Barco, no U.S warships are allowed to draw near the waters of Colombia . It also ordered its naval and air forces to intensify their sea patrols to safeguard the country's sovereignty . at the same time, the governments of Colombia, Venezuela, and some other nations refused to join the proposed U.S.``Drug-Fighting drill""in the Caribbean . faced with such a situation, the Bush administration had to order the``Drug-Fighting fleet""to return to base and cancel the``drill .""on the aforementioned acts of the United States, leaders of some Latin American nations commented: while relaxing the tension with the Soviet Union, the United States has reserved the``right""to interfere by force in Latin America and other small and weak countries . the public media of some nations solemnly pointed out: such moves of U.S . aggression are the continuation of the consistent U.S. policy of interfering in the affairs of Latin America and also the extension of what is called the Reagan doctrine, which started in the early 1980's . In U.S. relations with Latin America throughout the decade of the 1980's, there was a problem affecting the situation as a whole, namely, the issue of Central America, which had all along been listed in the category of East-West confrontation by the United States . The Reagan administration even gave top priority to meeting the crisis in Central America in its foreign policy . in 1981, when Reagan entered the White House, the situation in Central America stood as follows: the Sandinista revolution had won victory in Nicaragua, the guerrilla war in El Salvador was escalating, and a turbulent situation had started to emerge in other central American countries . The human rights diplomacy pursued by the Carter administration resulted in the deterioration of U.S. relations with a certain number of Latin American nations ruled by Juntas . In 1977 the Carter administration signed the Panama Canal treaty with the Panamanian government, agreeing to return to Panama sovereignty over the canal and the canal zone . before the victory of the Nicaragua revolution, in 1979 the Carter administration abandoned its support for the tyrannical Somosa regime and established normal relations with the Sandinista regime."

The Fmln terrorist actions have forced the government to make use of its legitimate right to defend society by using the armed forces which has been fully supported by the people . Salvadoran people do not want to lose their liberty and fall into the hands of totalitarian Marxist-Leninist systems such as the one the Fmln wants to impose ruthlessly . representatives from various countries who have observed the development of these incidents can fully confirm the facts . The Salvadoran people, in addition to being victims of the Fmln aggression, feel outraged because the Fmln still has the gall to say that it is speaking in defense of the Salvadoran people who, in these sad times, feel outraged by the terrorist group's irrational attack . The goverment of the Republic of El Salvador requests that the international community condemn this brutal violation of human rights perpetrated by the Fmln . It also asks the international community to condemn the hideous crimes the Fmln troops are Perpetrating against civilians--who flatly refuse to help them--and who have rejected them . The government also requests that the international community strongly condemn Nicaraguan President Ortega because he supplied the weapons that the terrorists are using to massacre the Salvadoran people."

The Democratic revolution in East Europe has also been a sensation to Chile . What hopes do you place in these gigantic radical changes? Aylwin: I think that the changes in East Europe are of very great importance for mankind . They give us satisfaction and hope . The opening of the Berlin Wall symbolizes the beginning of a new era in relations between East and West as well as the desire of the Germans to achieve unity again . We would like to see this situation lead to a reduction in military spending and to closer relations between the peoples . die Welt: what effects do you see for a third world country such as Chile? Aylwin: I see two effects . First, a symbolic effect . Chile is traditionally a Democratic country . Now the long period of a dictatorial regime is ending, however . This explosion of freedom coincides with the restoration of democracy in Chile . that is a stimulating feeling . We are embarking on the road of humanity . Second, there is a lot of talk about the danger of communism in our country; people say that communism could jeopardize our democratic future . I think that the events in East Europe and the Soviet Union demonstrate that communism is no longer a danger for the world . Nor for Chile . die Welt: Chile has the best organized Communist party in Latin America . has this party changed? What was its reaction? Aylwin: little is known about the situation of such a monolithic and coherent party . It was illegal and worked underground for a long time . However, I do not believe that any Communist party can ignore the events in that part of the world which has so far been dominated by Communist parties . The Chilean Communist party leaders have admitted that this is a universal process . die Welt: what relationship do you have with Volodia Teitelboim, the General Secretary of the Communist party? do you speak with him? do you see him sometimes? Aylwin: We have known each other from the time when we were both senators, meaning prior to 1973 . We were political opponents, but we often talked with each other . Since then, we have met only once, at a political function . My rivals in this election campaign have often misrepresented our relationship, and have described me as Teitelboim's secret ally . However, I think that people of different persuasions can talk with each other and can reach agreement . that has been done in Chile with some success . die Welt: the Communist party backed your candidacy . will it be represented in the new government? Aylwin: not at all . die Welt: but the future government will be a Left-Center government and will reflect the composition of the opposition today . Aylwin: yes, Chile will have a Left-Center government . The various Socialist currents will be represented . However, the strongest movement is the Christian Democratic party which is in the center . die Welt: do you think that following these elections, the panorama of the opposition will change? Aylwin: I have no doubt about that . There have been four families in the past--the Christian Democratic family, the social Democratically-Oriented family of the old radical party, the Socialist family, and the family of the right center . They all want to survive . die Welt: many people say that the Socialist Ricardo Lagos is the strongest figure of the opposition alliance . What role will he play in the future? Aylwin: he will concentrate on parliamentary work as a Senator . As is the case in every parliamentary democracy, he cannot be a member of the government as a representative of Congress."

There is, however, the law on coffee taxes which could be discussed with producers because the Law-Decree on coffee is very drastic . However, the country is making progress, and economic activities in various sectors--Commerce, construction, and manufacturing--are on the increase .

I do not think so . I think that what happened will benefit the country . acts of violence are regrettable, but those that have taken place have shown that we in Honduras are not immune to violence . the same day incidents were taking place here , 13 persons died in San Salvador as a result of a bomb explosion . The loss of lives is unfortunate and violence against a building and facilities next to the U.S. Embassy is regrettable because this does not help the country . have you talked with U.S. government officials about an Indemnity? it is being said that damage amounts to $6 million .

The state of emergency made it possible for people to cool down, and those on the streets returned to their homes . I feel it was beneficial . The Declaration of emergency decree was based on the Constitution and on Presidential authority . Congress was informed about this . I believe this was a positive measure, and this is how the people have viewed it, positively . do you believe the situation has been overcome? we do not know if the situation is over . I think so . I believe that what happened is that tempers got hot for a moment, and that some sectors, which I do not want to name because they have been identified by the people, took advantage of this . Perhaps some people tried to make political gains and the situation got out of hand . I believe, however, that everything is more or less quiet . The government is talking with the various sectors .

This violent, irrational, illogical, and senseless action began 8 days ago against peace-loving people who want to work, choose their own destiny, and seek their welfare . on this occasion I am deeply moved by the Salvadoran people's attitude, and, in my role as defense and public security Minister, I heartily congratulate them . The Salvadoran people's attitude has reflected their Stoicism, strong will, and indomitable spirit, hope, and faith in God and the armed forces . Salvadoran people, your attitude in recent days has been dignified and it has set an example . It is worthy of the Salvadoran people, who have always proved their faith and willingness to defend a just and noble cause, the homeland's cause . This is precisely what has given the Salvadoran people the will to live, love, and achieve peace . your attitude encourages us, places us under an obligation, and URGES us--as an institution at the service of the people--to continue the struggle to the end, so that we may eradicate forever the terror, violence, and disrespect that the terrorist forces have tried to impose on our Hard-Working and innocent people .

We strengthened investigation organizations, we created special public courts . We modified penal laws and procedures . We introduced new measures to encourage citizen participation and to protect citizens . We formed new components to bolster our public forces . Our efforts took quite a bit of time . One cannot provide an overnight solution for these complex problems with which you are all very familiar . Once the institutions in charge of maintaining public order and security were strengthened, we concentrated our available resources on solving the crimes committed by those terrorist groups . The results have been increasingly positive, both in the fight against drug trafficking--which is the central focus of many of these terrorist groups--and in the struggle against gangs of hired assassins and private justice organizations, also known as death squads . never before had we achieved such positive results . I am sure that even though we will face difficulties and obstacles, we will continue to win this battle against terrorism . to date, we have disbanded 23 gangs of hired assassins operating in Envigado in Antioquia Department, Huican in Boyaca Department, Puerto Lopez and San Martin in Meta Department, La Rochela in Santander Department, and Llanos del Yari in Caqueta Department .

He added that one of the explosive devices hit a wall of the Air Force installations and the shock wave from the explosion damaged some buildings . According to preliminary conclusions, the attack was probably a propaganda ploy because the devices were rudimentary and similar to firecrackers . The terrorist actions seem to be motivated by the fact that the irregular groups are shrinking considerably . evidence of this is the fact that a subversive who surrendered on the Southern coast was carrying some important documents in which the guerrillas admitted that they had made a big effort to show their presence, but that nothing substantial resulted and they suffered many casualties instead, Gramajo said . When questioned about the possible impact of these terrorist actions on the talks being held in Oslo, Norway, Gramajo said that those who are taking part in the talks do not maintain contact with the groups that carry out the terrorist actions . among those groups, there is one faction that is called the International militant group . This faction is comprised of persons who love adventure; these people take advantage of subversive groups to engage in some of these activities."

We have been fighting without that goal, without having any commitment to negotiate anything . However, that does not mean that the situation should remain the same . Now there is a new factor, a commitment to negotiate and reach agreements on all those topics . It is very important that the Salvadoran people know the contents of the agenda, that they are fully aware of all the topics to be discussed, and that they know the importance of the timetable agreement for discussions and negotiations . You journalists can help the people understand problem . commander, when do you expect the Fmln to join the process? look, deadlines are not the most important thing right now . What is important now is complying with the agreements to reach political agreements . that is the main aspect of the Geneva agreement . It is possible that some deadlines will not be met . If deadlines are set and the time for implementing them expires, then this is tantamount to wasting time . This then leads to steps being demanded that in reality depend on the political agreements that are reached and not the deadlines for reaching them . Therefore, according to the agenda and the timetable agreed to here in Caracas, the accent is on the political agreements . Those agreements have to do with changes within the armed forces . everything related to the armed forces must be changed . Every factor concerning the armed forces must be reviewed from a certain point or perspective . changes are necessary; changes must be made and those changes must be significant . These changes must completely transform the armed forces, beginning with its role and influence in determining the country's policies and guidelines . We have been presenting proposals in this regard for some time . The topic of democratization is closely linked to the topic of the armed forces, to its purging, its reduction, and in sum, its end . We believe that the country will not always need the armed forces . As with any institution or historical factor, it emerges, it is maintained for a certain time, and then it tends to disappear . the country must have the opportunity to develop . It cannot continue along the same path because this would only represent expenses and a heavy burden for the country . for several decades, the armed forces have meant absence of liberty, real security, and the impossibility of the civilian society to decide the country's path . elections have been turned into a mere formality, where those who were not elected run the country . the country is now going through a drama that has also shocked the International public, the murder of the Jesuit priests .

Meanwhile, Cristiani is maintaining his hypocritical position of moderation . The Massacres, detentions, and repression of earthquake victims, the Repatriated, universities, labor unions, peasant Cooperatives, mothers' organizations, and other segments of the population show that the war of the armed forces, government, and arena is aimed against the people and, therefore, these groups cannot and will not remain idle .

Meanwhile, operators from the state-run oil company yesterday began repairing the Cano Limon-Covenas oil pipeline dynamited on the night of 12 July in Arauquita jurisdiction, which forced the suspension of oil pumping from Arauca Intendancy's oil fields to the Gulf of Morrosquillo . members of the contingency team supported by Petroven and the Venezuelan environment and natural resources Ministry are cleaning up a huge oil spill at the Arauca River caused by the 7 July attack against the Cano Limon-Covenas oil pipeline . that attack resulted in a spill of 13,000 barrels of oil, which severely contaminated farming areas and the Arauca River, to the point that the Potable water service was temporarily suspended in Arauca's capital city."

Cristiani begins by saying that this is his first report to the nation after 50 days as President . He notes that since he assumed power on 1 June, the Farabundo Marti National liberation front has increased its level of violence and its number of``indiscriminate killings .""he says that there is no reason for this since he expressed on 1 June his desire find a peaceful solution to the conflict in the country . Cristiani says that since 1 June he has repeatedly called for a peace dialogue, adding:``in order to begin a dialogue of this nature, it must be held in two phases: naturally, during the first phase both sides must sit down to discuss the mechanisms to develop that dialogue process, a timetable for the talks, and the place where the talks will be held . In other words, the first phase will be to determine how the dialogue process will take place . The second phase--once an agreement is reached on how the dialogue will be held--is what will be discussed . in that regard, our government has not set any conditions . We are willing to discuss any topic, because we know that we must find solutions to many things, and we are willing to do so . The only condition we have demanded for this dialogue process is that, once it begins, it should not be interrupted for any reason . We believe that people want peace as soon as possible, and we cannot hold talks for years . Once we sit down to talk, that dialogue should continue until an overall solution is found to the conflict . that is our government's position, and we maintain that position because we believe it is the most logical one .""turning to economic matters, Cristiani says that the country needs to solve three problems: the fiscal deficit, inflation, and unemployment . He says that as a first step to begin the National economic recovery is to reform the government's pricing policy, adding:``We must protect low-income groups, and for this reason we have asked the economy minister to begin a process aimed at eliminating price controls . We believe that we can eliminate price controls on 230 products without having a major impact on the majority of the public and that we can keep staple products under the control of the economy Ministry .""he says that price controls on staples like basic grains, powdered milk, flour, coffee, sugar, vegetable oil and lard, cement for housing, and oil by-products will not be eliminated . regarding the transportation sector, Cristiani says:``We agreed with the transportation sector to deregulate the differential service . to allow them to continue serving low-income segments of the population while charging current fares, we will also allow them to offer the higher-priced service . In other words, people will be able to choose what kind of service they want to use: whether they continue to use the low-priced service or a better, more comfortable, and faster service .""on electricity rates, Cristiani says:``We feel that adjustments to electricity rates should be applied as a result of power that is wasted, that is, because it is power that is being consumed beyond what is needed to live normally . The increase in electricity rates will be directly proportional to the consumption of energy in each home . We believe that with this initial measure, the Cel solve problems .""turning to other economic measures, Cristiani says:``We have to take short-term measures too . In this respect, the most logical step is to take measures that will affect consumption and not revenues . Thus, we have asked the Finance Minister to take measures related to taxes . He is to consolidate tax payments and only exempt the previously mentioned basic bread basket items from the present 5-percent tax . We have to start eliminating tax exemptions . only exports should have some type of monetary incentive because our country is interested in developing its exports . The rest of the country's economic sectors should be taxed at the same rate .""Cristiani adds:``We are going to modify the system of paying income tax . We believe that the current system is based on unjust regulations, on revenues earned the previous year that do not reflect a firm's present situation . Thus, we are going to request that income-tax payments be based on a small percentage of the firm's present sales; these are a truer and more accurate reflection of a firm's income .""Cristiani says that the country's monetary policy must be aimed at increasing savings to promote domestic economic development . He says that it is necessary to make interest received on savings accounts in the country's banks more attractive so that capital does not leave the country . regarding the country's currency, Cristiani says:``We feel that currency value should be based on the availability of and demand for foreign exchange . We do not think it is appropriate for the government to arbitrarily devalue and fix an exchange rate on the Salvadoran colon . Everything must be based on the foreign exchange our country may have to pay out for imports, because if we were to fix the rate at 10 to 1, the central banks still would not have enough foreign exchange to cover all the importers' demands .""further details as available."
1525,TST3-MUC4-0026,SANTIAGO,1989-07-16,"1 . During the years of dictatorship, Chilean foreign relations were divided into two processes . on the one hand, as the dictatorship became more and more isolated, it was increasingly condemned in international fora and repudiated by international public opinion . on the other hand, as more and more countries and organizations expressed their support for a free Chile and generously granted their solidarity to our cause, our organizations and Democratic parties became increasingly open to the world . Thus, they expanded their horizons and contributed their experiences . 2 . During this period, the party has substantially strengthened its international relations and enhanced its vision of the International situation . It has strengthened its ties with the Latin American peoples' revolutionary and Democratic cause, and it has fully immersed itself in the great debates of world socialism . to these debates we brought our views on a profoundly renewed leftist socialism committed to democracy, development, and social change . 3 . Our relations with the parties that make up the International Socialist and with the SI organization itself have been enriched within this context . This strengthening of ties has been the result of two things . First, it is based on the position that in compliance with its principles the SI has upheld regarding the Chilean situation . in October 1973, a few days after the coup, SI chairman Willy Brandt condemned the end of the Chilean democracy and president Allende's assassination at the UN General Assembly . at the time he also said this was a great step backward for those who aspired to achieve socialism through democratic means . Since then, the SI has been permanently mobilized in favor of Chile by making the Chilean cause and Salvador Allende the symbols of all international struggle for democracy and change . It is within this framework of interest and cooperation that the voice of Chilean socialism has been heard and our ideas and proposals praised . 4 . The second reason stems from the process of expansion and transformation experienced by the SI in the past 2 decades . The overall process of change that took place in the world during this period--the technological revolution, the growing interdependence among nations, expansion of communications, global nuclear and military proliferation, the emergence of developing countries as international counterparts, the worsening of extreme poverty and international inequalities, the progress of liberation struggles in the third world, international awareness of the values of democracy and human rights--has also effected major changes in the ideas and positions of Socialist parties around the world . In this framework, the SI has expanded its outlook, has increasingly renewed its ideas and, above all, has accepted pluralism within its fold as well as a broad internal debate about the best way to promote the cause of an autonomous, democratic socialism . It should be noted that this debate acquired a democratic, Antifascist content as a result of the major role played by Socialist forces that have engaged in a long Antifascist struggle."

How, Mr President? well, I do not know . It is not easy to solve this problem . none of the problems will be easy to solve . is there a possibility for dialogue? Yes, but the Nicaraguan government would also have to hold a dialogue with the Nicaraguan resistance . I am the Voz de Nicaragua reporter . What is your opinion of the agreement reached by the Nicaraguan government with the political parties? well, I read the agreement last night and believe it to be a step forward . Incidentally, I read it twice last night and it is a very long document . I am talking about the agreement with the parties that are truly opposition parties and not the one made with the other parties because these are not really opposition parties . What I wanted was your opinion on the demobilization of the Contras from Honduras . Oh, you are talking about the small document that makes demands, demands, and more demands . This document has no value . I mean the document signed with the 21 political parties...that agreement is valuable but it does not mention the Contra demobilization . The document States that the Nicaraguan government and the opposition parties agree that the Esquipulas II and Costa del Sol agreements should be abided by . This is the document I read twice, and I believe it is quite serious and a step forward . What will you do to get the mercenaries to leave your country? first, I do not use derogatory terms . They are Nicaraguans who for different reasons disagree with the system in Nicaragua . These Nicaraguans oppose the system, and for this and other reasons they have taken up arms against the system and have taken refuge in Honduras . I do not use the term Mercenary . I understand the Nicaraguan government uses it and it is all right for them to do so, but I will not answer a question that uses a term that I believe is too derogatory . The demobilization plan has a very firm deadline and is to be completed within 90 days . do you think...no, no . The 90-day deadline is included in an agreement signed by Nicaraguan President Ortega with three small Nicaraguan leftist parties . I do not believe this document is very important . I do believe, however, that the agreement signed by the Nicaraguan president and the opposition parties is important because it is based on the Esquipulas II and Costa del Sol agreements . terrorists in El Salvador and Contras are presently not active, so both situations--Contras and guerrillas--are different . is it true that President Cristiani is going to present a parallel program at the summit? President Cristiani comes to the summit as El Salvador's legitimate President . He has the right to present his points of view . He has the right to contribute to the solution of problems in other countries as well as to ones in his own country . is there a possibility that a demobilization plan for the Salvadoran guerrillas will be studied at this summit if President Cristinai presents one? of course . He has a right to do so."

Diaz' murder unleashed a wave of protests; 17,000 Empemployees from the legal sector staged a strike on 1 August and forced a statement from the government . I am warning the country that the next murder in the judicial branch will necessarily result in the collective resignation of all the judges . protective measures have been adopted for all judges and work continues . On 14 August, due to death threats against his daughter, first public order judge Alvaro Medina Moreno, who was investigating the Wanumen Arms-Trafficking case and the attack on the Das director, announced his resignation . two days later, on 16 August, due to death threats the eighth public order judge in Medellin, who was investigating the governor of Antioquia's murder, resigned . shortly before justice Valencia's murder yesterday, the seventh public order judge in Bogota, who was investigating the search of a building in northern Bogota, decided to resign and leave the country . to conclude, the intimidation of judges led to Valencia's murder last night in downtown Bogota . two people approached Valencia and began shooting at him . Valencia's Bodyguards stooped down, they did not have time to respond . When their attackers fled, the Bodyguards came out and began shooting wildly .

1530,TST3-MUC4-0031,HAVANA ,1989-08-19,"During the past few days, violence in Colombia has taken spectacular turns . According to a report which cites reliable sources, it seems that the hand of drug traffickers is behind the assassinations of Judge Carlos Valencia, of the Bogota, which occurred yesterday . The Colombian drug mafia has created a great money and crime empire in Colombia with powerful ramifications outside its borders, especially in the United States--the main consumer of cocaine and other drugs in the world . yesterday, Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez spoke on the phone with his Colombian counterpart, Virgilio Barco, and it is said that the main subject of their conversation was the relationship between youth delinquency and drug trafficking . It is important to note the words of Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez . We must reflect, said Carlos Andres Perez, on the need for us, all Venezuelans, to face drug trafficking in Venezuela . We must also acknowledge that drug trafficking is the Abominable crime of our times, and that there cannot be any hesitation or compassion toward drug traffickers . those are the words of Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez . In reality, the drug trafficking drama is seriously affecting several Latin American countries . We have the dramatic case of Colombia, but the situation also exists in Venezuela, Bolivia, Peru, well, in several Latin American countries . Now, the solution to that problem...as has been pointed out by Latin Americans themselves and their most prominent figures, the final solution to the dramatic drug trafficking problem must be based on putting an end to the consumption of drugs . that is the main stumbling block in the fight against drug trafficking . The United States is the main consumption center of drugs in the world, and U.S. policy on drug trafficking is not consistent with the need to put an end and actively repress the consumption of drugs . U.S. policy, and all this is very well known in Latin America, is based on destroying the plantations of a native plant in the continent, which is Coca . Presidents, political and social figures of the continent have said that the solution is not based on the destruction of a native plant but in active fight against drug consumption . I think that the statements made by the President of Venezuela and the dramatic situation that Colombia is facing these days confirm that the policy for fighting drug trafficking must be tenacious, strong, without hesitation and compassion . It must also be based on ending drug consumption by the United States--the main drug consumer of the world--which lives precisely from drug consumption and its business."

These two countries are known for their cocaine crops and the drug cartel's organized activities . In addition, Extremist right-wing and Left-Wing organizations there are actively trying to achieve political goals through terrorist activity . Hadashot has learned from a source who was in Peru for about 6 months that elements linked to the drug growers spent approximately $9 million on military equipment from Israeli arms dealers in 1987 . The equipment included Galil rifles, flak jackets, ammunition belts and ammunition, various types of grenades, and communications and night vision equipment . in 1988 and 1989, in additional deals worth some $6 million, mortars, shells, sniper rifles, and ammunition for light weapons were purchased . The arms were sent to Peru via Mexico and Guatemala . at least 3 Idf Reserve officers were in Peru for over 2 months in early 1988 to organize fighting units . The Peruvian fighters were presented to the officers as belonging to right-wing political bodies in the country, and the team of instructors included mercenaries from the Netherlands and England . The team of instructors was made up of some 10 people, some of whom were recruited through an Israeli-Netherlander arms dealer who lives in Amsterdam . The Netherlands media is conducting a wide-ranging investigation into the subject despite the surprising lack of interest by the Netherlands authorities in the affair . at the same time, Israelis in neighboring Bolivia acted as instructors in a course on safeguarding businessmen, guerrilla warfare, and regional defense . These Israelis reached Bolivia in the wake of an arms consignment worth some $12 million, which arrived in Peru via a third party, which purchased it in an African country, which in turn had received it from Israel . following the reports on deals by Israelis abroad, the income tax investigations division has begun an inquiry into tax payments on Israeli arms deals and training abroad . in the past 5 years, the scope of commissions paid to arms dealers is estimated at $1 billion . at least half of it went to big dealers, such as Sha'Ul Eisenberg, Marcus Katz, Pesah Ben-Or, Israces, and others .

The device which exploded in Manrique destroyed the Bank building and a bus that was parked in front of the building, and caused considerable damage in several stores nearby . The explosion in the other branch was of a lesser magnitude, and it broke windows and caused damage inside the offices .

Our reporter Hernando Corrales has the details: if the authorities in charge of an operation near Puerto Boyaca on 18 July last year had not sabotaged it, the foreign instructors at the service of the Medellin cartel would now be jail . on that date, Marta Lucia Gonzalez, second judge of public order, wrote a file NOTE saying that the judicial inspection was unjustly torpedoed with the argument that nothing had been found and that this argument was senseless and illogical since absolutely no one other than the Undersigned judge could decide if he or she had anything to inspect, or if he or she should or should not conduct the judicial proceeding . The document, which is contained in the Dossier on the massacre in La Hondura and La Negra, Uraba region, says that she was left 2 days inside a plane at the airport of the Texas Petroleum company in Puerto Boyaca and that the police authorities accompanying her failed to explain to her why they had not taken any action . In fact, she and several Das inspectors encountered some obstacles . The Attorney General's office was informed of these obstacles in order for it to make an investigation . I think that when she and the Das personnel were preparing to go to Puerto Boyaca it was already known that these people would be present there for these proceedings and this was quite worrisome . As is known, Judge Gonzalez had to leave Colombia because her life was threatened, and her father, former Boyaca governor Alvaro Gonzalez Santana, was subsequently murdered . Moreover, Gen Maza Marquez said further that the fact that a payment is being offered for the capture of Pablo Escobar and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha does not mean that other persons accused of being Capos of the mafia are not being sought too . We are taking action the length and breadth of the country . We are not showing any special considerations because we intend to act Indiscriminately .

1541,TST3-MUC4-0042,SAN SALVADOR,1989-09-28,"Colonel Rene Emilio Ponce, chairman of the joint Chiefs of staff, said today that the offensive launched on 26 September by the Farabundo Marti National liberation front, Fmln, was a mistaken step taken by the rebels within the context of the dialogue process with the government, which was resumed in Mexico . Col Ponce said that with this attitude the rebels are not showing a real desire for peace, and he described it as a propagandistic action . today, during his tour of various areas of conflict, Col Ponce said that recent Fmln attacks on various military positions as part of its latest campaign following the unilateral truce was a serious mistake on the part of the Rebel commanders, as they have been carried out in the midst of a dialogue between the rebels and the government, which has been described as continuous . that shows there are, on the one hand, the proposals and what the terrorist leaders call their desire for peace, and, on the other hand, the real actions . I think that the campaign the Fmln has mounted nationwide was a bad step, because it does not show a real and sincere desire to seek peace in our country . Colonel Ponce added that the request for reducing the number of troops as stated in the guerrilla proposal is a political move . He played down the latest rebel offer presented to the government in Mexico . The proposal was aimed at improving the Fmln's image abroad, which had deteriorated in one way or another . The proposal can be discussed; however, we in the armed forces are not the ones who will discuss it or who will decide whether it can or cannot be accepted . It is a political decision, and the armed forces will accept the decision made by the government . The military commanders are not the ones who must decide on the number of troops the institution should have . This is a decision to be made by the legislative Assembly, based on the requirements and threats the country may be facing . Colonel Ponce visited the positions of the Army's Belloso and Atlacatl elite battalions in the towns of Perquin in Morazan Department and La Laguna in Chalatenango Department, near the Honduran border, where fighting is taking place . During this military tour, Col Ponce said that it has been demonstrated that there is no liberated or permanently occupied territory in El Salvador . However, the rebels claim they control that area of intense conflict where the war has left its indelible mark."
1542,TST3-MUC4-0043,NO CITY ,1989-09-29,"Such an unconditional cease-fire does not correspond to the spirit of the Esquipulas and Tela agreements and the accords the government and the Fmln signed in Mexico in which the sides clearly agreed to find solutions in the area and in El Salvador . asking for an end to the war and negotiations is like demanding that the situation be changed without having won the war . In addition to being unrealistic, this is a formula for not negotiating and continuing the war . in the Esquipulas II documents, the governments urge the sides to agree to a cease-fire . The Tela accords also appeal to the Salvadoran government to reach an agreement with the Fmln in the spirit of the Esquipulas II accords . This particular agreement links the cessation of hostilities to democratization, social justice, and self-determination as a harmonious, indivisible whole . This concept is supported by the UN Security Council in its resolution 637 of 27 July 1989 . In addition, the first paragraph of the Mexican accord reads as follows: the Salvadoran government and the Fmln will talk in an effort to reach an understanding through negotiations to conclude the armed conflict through political means as soon as practicable . The Salvadoran government and the Fmln will foster the country's democratization and reunite Salvadoran society . The dialogue is meant to serve as an instrument for reaching an agreement on cessation of hostilities . The agreement that the government signed in Mexico says nothing of talking about or negotiating the Fmln's demobilization but mentions negotiations to encourage democratization to agree on the cessation of hostilities . by increasing the number of human rights violations, Cristiani is closing the door to democratization . This, plus his refusal to reach an agreement with the Fmln, makes him guilty of noncompliance with the commitments that the government made at Esquipulas . 3 . In accordance with the commitment we made in Mexico and with the regional accords, we reiterate our full willingness to agree with the government on a cease-fire as soon as practicable and to attend the upcoming negotiation meeting in Costa Rica . for this meeting, we have included in our peace proposal an agreement on a cease-fire based on the following points: reforms to the judicial system; cessation of repression; trial of both those guilty of the murder of Monsignor Arnulfo Romero and those found to be members of the death squads; enforcement of the 1980 economic and social reforms; and suspension of the economic measures that exacerbate the crisis and the war; purge of the Army; constitutional amendments; holding the 1991 elections ahead of schedule; minimum operational guarantees to establish geographical areas for the forces to maintain an effective cease-fire . After strong opposition to the presence of the UN and OAS Secretary generals' representatives, who will serve as witnesses at the dialogue table, Cristiani agreed to invite them to the Costa Rica meeting . We hope he keeps his word because this will lend seriousness to the process and guarantee the negotiations initiated in Mexico . signed the Fmln general command"

1546,TST3-MUC4-0047,MOSCOW ,1989-10-12,"The most pressing demands of the Chilean people have been brought up in the electoral campaign . one of the most important achievements of this campaign has been the combining of the campaign with the just economic, political, and social demands that the democratic forces and the popular movement have been making for these 16 years of dictatorship . These demands are related to the struggle against repression, the defense of human rights, the denunciation of crimes committed by the regime, and efforts to fight immunity and the suppression of the truth regarding torture, Disappearances, and assassinations . These questions have once again come into the spotlight now that many rightist candidates are Demagogically attempting to pose as defenders of human rights and since El Mercurio has reported that the dictator is planning to convert the CNI into an agency of the Army so that the main repressive body from all these years can be under his direct control . Jaime Inzunza, leader of the United left and the Communist party of Chile, discusses these topics over a direct phone line from Santiago, Chile . How are the Chilean people's demands connected to the ongoing electoral campaign? they are connected through the democratization of the neighborhood boards during the electoral process; the strengthening of the unified actions of workers; the development of the committees for victory, which will also be committees for the defense of victory and committees for carrying on the Democratic task; the development of confidence; the struggle for human rights, particularly concerning truth and justice and immunity for crimes; the increasing pressure by the immense majority of the population for the release of all political prisoners; and naturally for the dissolution of the CNI . all of these questions are being brought up in the electoral campaign, and agreements have been reached within social organizations . This was evidenced a week ago by the Salvadora strike and by the current strike by coal miners . This proves that the people have understood that the electoral campaign has to be an expression of their activities and a way to strengthen their social organizations for the future struggle . The preceding comments were made by Communist party of Chile leader Jaime Inzunza, who has been interviewed over the telephone on our program``Escucha Chile .""another topic discussed by Inzunza was the El Mercurio report on the CNI's transfer to the Army . The dissolution of the CNI has become one of the most pressing demands of the immense majority of Chileans . What is your opinion, Jaime Inzunza, on the dictator's intention to maintain the CNI as it is and to keep it under his direct command? I believe that this issue is particularly serious . The intention is to maintain intact the main terrorist apparatus of the dictatorship, which has been responsible for the most flagrant violations of human rights throughout the years of its existence . I understand that the Dina and the CNI have been in fact a single apparatus and therefore the main organs of state Terrorrism over the past 15 years . If transferred to the Army, the CNI would continue to be under Pinochet's orders . Under whose orders has it been all these years? for whom has it been a direct agent all these years? henceforth it will be under the control of the office of the Commander in chief of the Army . Communist leader Jaime Inzunza added that Pinochet's intent in transferring the CNI to the Army's direct command is to make the institution an accomplice in concealing people who have been responsible for crimes and human rights violations . The idea is to involve the military institution in crimes for which the Chilean people knows it was not responsible . This is clear: what the Democratic opposition forces want is to have the culprits behind those crimes and human rights violations prosecuted, not the military institution . The transfer of the CNI to the Army is an attempt to make the men in uniform act as accomplices or accessories to those crimes . loyalty is not at stake here; loyalty is defending values and principles, not some sort of criminal complicity that is not in line with the training of these men . This seems to me to be particularly serious because this transfer implies maintaining the CNI under the orders of the man responsible for the crimes committed all these years, the dictator himself . These have been answers given by Jaime Inzunza, United left and Communist party of Chile leader, to questions put to him over the phone by``Escucha Chile ,""a radio Moscow international program."

This report is included in a government decree approved by President Paz Zamora . According to interior Ministry under Secretary Raul Loayza, police arrested 500 teachers and education leaders in the nine departmental capitals, thus thwarting the extended hunger strike . The strike by teachers, who have been demanding a bonus of 300 Bolivian pesos, has unleashed violent street confrontations over the past few days and at least four bombings . The government, which has been besieged by a wave of social demands and pressured by the 80,000 teachers, has stated that these demonstrations are undermining Democratic stability . It added that despite efforts to find a path to peaceful coexistence and dialogue, it has not been possible to prevent radical groups interested in the Union leadership from publicly challenging the government .

The soldiers broke into the priests' bedrooms, captured them, and brutally murdered them in the garden .

The persons who ordered the horrible murder of the Jesuits and three Salvadoran citizens are the same ones who ordered pilots, artillery men, and Machinegunners in planes to attack the civilian population . They are the same ones who are against reaching a political solution to the Salvadoran conflict . They are the top military and political figures in Alfredo Cristiani's administration . The human rights promotion and protection Secretariat calls on the international community to tie the hands of these murderers of Salvadoran people and to aid in finding a solution to the National crisis so we may attain a just and lasting peace our people so desire . no more barbaric actions in San Salvador . no more injustices . trial and punishment for the murderers .

An offensive was launched simultaneously throughout the country's territory; however, San Salvador's city blocks, which were the scene of fierce fighting between Fmln Detachments and government troops, were the epicenter of Sunday's events . The intense Firefight involving artillery and helicopters lasted approximately 18 hours and encompassed virtually the entire capital, completely paralyzing life in the city . According to Reuter, attempts were made to storm President Alfredo Cristiani's official and personal residences; however, it is reported that the President was not hurt . reports of the losses on both sides are contradictory . a state of siege has been introduced in El Salvador and constitutional guarantees have been suspended . A Curfew is in force in the capital, and the International Airport has been closed . According to President Cristiani, whose speech was broadcast on the radio, these steps are needed to``defend the population against Left-Wing terrorism .""according to the President, the military are in complete control of the situation; however, it is reported from San Salvador that these words by A. Cristiani were heard on the airwaves accompanied by continual explosions and shooting . International observers regard events in San Salvador in the context of the interrupted talks between the government and the insurgents . The third round of these talks should have been held recently in Caracas, but opposition representatives refused to take part in them after a Left-Wing trade union's headquarters was subjected to artillery bombardment resulting in the deaths of at least 10 people . According to the insurgents, the government decided on dialogue with them solely out of propaganda considerations, with no intention of reaching any agreement . Sunday's offensive was thus an attempt on their part to show themselves to be a force to be reckoned with . in the opinion of observers, however, events in San Salvador practically rule out all hopes of success for future talks between the government and representatives of the insurgents . Moreover, the fighting in the Salvadoran capital, a Reuter correspondent believes, dealt the fragile peace settlement process in Central America a considerable blow."

There may be some witnesses, who may be willing to cooperate, but they may not be available right now . He said he was willing to help . They wanted the investigations to take place . Well, I believe much depends on the position of the Fmln . I have listened to several versions all the way from demanding my resignation to assassination attempts against me to finish everything up . Under these terms, they are saying we are about to create a new Lebanon, and they are saying the Fmln has control over certain liberated areas in the capital . However, if we talked about the situation rationally and reasonably, there could be . Well, we have talked about the Air Force situation in the past . The air force has orders not to bomb and not to use its weapons against urban areas of the capital unless it has been able to detect and isolate a clear Fmln target . In this regard, Air Force bombs were not used until last night when Air Force planes were attacked from some sugarcane fields north of the 1533 landing strip...use bombs to stop the use of Fmln mortars . The air force used Machineguns the only time they were used within the urban area, to be sure they were not endangering anyone, were two mortars installed in the soccer field of the National University . One was fired at the police Battalion in Zacamil neighborhood, and the other was firing at the 1ST Brigade . I believe that among the weapons that were seized, there are some of that . I am not too sure . in the, near the San Jacinto Hill were used to support troops that were using the San Jacinto Hill . We believe it was the Fmln Withrawing in Santa Marta . up to now, the position of the armed forces staff and the high command in the use of the Air force is only and when specific targets can be isolated in which the civilian population is not endangered . I do not have it with me right now, but there will be a report on the military situation by the high command tonight."

The U.S. government has acknowledged the bombings after cynically saying it knew nothing about them . However, that acknowledgement is even more hair-raising than the denial . hear us well: the U.S. government has stated that it supports the government troops' efforts to crush the offensive which has caused so many personal tragedies; and it praised the Army for decreeing strict laws to prevent civilian casualties . We also hear the pet expression that the Fmln is using civilians to protect its fighters, and the principle of removing the people from their environment is Unscrupulously applied once more . This is why the northern part of the country was destroyed, leaving entire towns in ruins--and now large areas of the country's most important cities are being destroyed . One day those ruins will become the evidence we will show our children to prove that Fascism once existed in the country . However, the U.S . imperialism's Clumsiness goes even further . the North Americans apparently want to become involved in a large-scale conflict--for the sake of a few death squad members who have already earned the world's scorn--given the decision to send U.S. pilots to bomb the civilian population by night . The Fascist Salvadoran dictatorship has unleashed the brutal tactics used by Somoza before leaving power . on that occasion the U.S . imperialism turned its back on the tyrant . The United States' foreign policy have never stooped so low and the decisions adopted by the U.S. government have never brought the possibility of a regional conflict so close . What does the Nicaraguan government think about the airplanes being flown by U.S. pilots only a few hundred km from its border? What will happen if Guatemala continues to involve itself in the Salvadoran conflict? the consequences are Unforeseeable . The U.S . imperialism has soiled its hands with a new genocide in El Salvador . The U.S. people should deeply reflect about this and stop their government from provoking contempt of that nation--which is being Disinformed and intoxicated by the anti-Communist propaganda . large groups of Abraham Lincoln's people, the best sons of the United States, have reacted and have taken to the streets--deep inside the U.S . imperialism's heart . soon, very soon, this will become an Unstoppable surge . The U.S. government's strategic goal is clear: the Salvadoran people . The U.S. government wants the Salvadoran people to . to quote Monsignor Romero, the Army--and in this case the North Americans--are like serpents, which only bite the Shoeless .

Those officers have luxurious mansions in Miami . Every weekend and even in spite of the war, Col Ponce has orgies in his luxurious homes in the country's interior . soldiers, patriotic officers, we call on you to join the people and join our front . patriotic officers, who are listening to us, do not allow more bombings in our capital city by the Genocidal Tandona group . young officers, lieutenants who are being killed in the residential areas and neighborhoods of the capital city, why should you be killed while defending Ponce's mansions? this is the last scenario of the last chapter in which the Fmln will achieve the victory of the people . We call on your conscience, young patriotic officer . Just look at what happened in the bombings of Zacamil . over 500 homes were razed . are you going to allow the high command to finish off the city, to finish off the neighborhoods and residential areas where your relatives might be? you saw what happened in Zacamil, Mejicanos, Soyapango . patriotic officer, it is time we sit down to talk, to see what we can do with our Fatherland, and what are we going to do with La Tandona . patriotic officers who are listening to us: it is useless to continue defending; to continue defending what, we ask you .

It is important to point out that in San Benito and La Sultana residential areas, we are fighting against soldiers from Sonsonate, and not from San Salvador . The soldiers are from military detachment no . 6 of Sonsonate . troops from Sonsonate have been brought into San Salvador, because the high command has lost control of the situation . In other words, there is a mixture of soldiers from all parts of the country in the capital city . This has yielded negative results for the high command . in the capital city, there have been clashes between the Atlacatl Battalion and the national police, and the National Guard has attacked troops from military detachment no . 6 .

It is a symbol of the crimes that are being committed against the civilian population in that country . The United States is not innocent of these crimes because U.S. pilots are participating in the massacre . in the meantime, what is the human rights champion doing? in fact, he is doing nothing that could not be predicted .

The human rights champion asks no questions about the recent brutal killings of union leaders by the Army . Bush asks no questions about the massacre of Spanish priests . The President only praises the Army, the Air Force, the police and paramilitary efforts to stop the guerrilla offensive . Bush and Cristiani could not fail to mention the trite slogan of the Cuban and Nicaraguan aid to the Salvadoran guerrillas . Nor did Bush fail to express the American people's solidarity . But, solidarity with whom? all we have heard about up to now are the protests provoked in the United States by the U.S. military aid to the Salvadoran regime .

The Fmln launched this aggression with all of its forces, chiefly using a concentration of weapons and fighters in the San Salvador metropolitan zone, in Zacatecoluca, La Paz Department, and at times in Usulutan city, Usulutan Deparment, and in San Miguel city, San Miguel Department . In this aggression the Fmln displayed its weaponry . It displayed an incredible amount of weapons, which .... by the way, in recent days the Salvadoran armed forces have begun a number of searches in some houses where it is believed that some of these weapons were located . We have already found large amounts of weapons . In addition, the Fmln launched an aggression and hid behind you, Salvadoran people . It used you as a shield, wanting to convey the idea that they have the support of the Salvadoran people and that the people here would rise up to support them . They have realized that this view is totally false . far from supporting the Fmln, the Salvadoran people, Salvadoran Brothers, supported the armed forces in the tremendous effort it has conducted to repel the Fmln aggression . However, we must now consider a very important matter . It is impossible to carry out an aggression of this size without support from someone abroad . on this occasion, we are certain that this support came from Nicaraguan President Ortega and Cuban President Castro, but chiefly from Ortega who is trying to raise a smokescreen in the face of the real possibility that Mrs Violetta Chamorro may defeat him in the elections, and because the Fmln has always been the puppet of the International Communist aggression in which Ortega and Castro participate . If this is not so, let us take a look at what has happened . During those times when you were suffering moments of anguish last week, you were able to see the large number of foreigners who were supporting the Fmln terrorists . We have also managed to collect evidence that the Ortega government trained Fmln fighters in the use of certain kinds of weaponry, specifically the grenade launchers . What happened? in the past few weeks we began noticing what kind of weapons were being used . in the foiled attack on the Presidential house, a subsequent attack on the Salvadoran armed forces' joint Chiefs of staff, and Lastly, an attack on the National Guard Garrison particular kinds of weapons were being used . as a result of the savage action by Fmln, two little girls were killed . Moreover, let us recall and see the connection that exists with all the shipments that the Salvadoran armed forces have been stopping between Nicaraguan and El Salvador . One shipment was made prior to the visit we Presidents made to Costa Rica . in that country, we denounced Ortega for continuing to send weapons and supporting the Fmln in an open violation of the central American peace process . and what has happened lately? on 25 November, Salvadoran people, two light airplanes coming from Nicaragua were discovered . their flight course indicates that they came from Nicaragua, especially the one where the weapons were found . As additional proof, we have a document showing that one light aircraft belongs to the Seta transportation company located in Nicaragua's Augusto Cesar Sandino airport . It was bringing sophisticated equipment for the Fmln . in that aircraft accident, four people were killed: the pilot who was wearing civilian clothes and three other people were wearing military uniforms; I mean camouflage uniforms like the ones worn in many countries, and like the ones the Salvadoran armed force use . It is believed that two of those people died as a result of the accident . We also believe that another person killed himself because he had a weapon in his hand and a bullet wound in forehead . He killed himself because he saw himself implicated in this situation."

According to Chica, the Fmln leaders in Managua decided to launch the offensive, trusting the Unts leaders' reports that conditions were right for an insurrection because Febe Elizabeth Velazquez' death in the dynamite attack against Fenastras had ignited the people's spirits . The prisoner said that the Fmln may carry out a summary trial in the style of Communist parties against those responsible for the failure . Now, he said, to save themselves from the responsibility of having deceived the terrorist criminals who allowed themselves to be led by lies, the Unts leaders are expected to call news conferences to announce that their struggle continues . Meanwhile, a report from Zacatecoluca, La Paz Department, indicates that Fmln terrorist criminals, using Sam-7 missiles, attacked a Salvadoran Air Force 0-2 airplane which was in the area directing support near Piedra Grande Abajo in the jurisdiction of Zacatecoluca . No damages or casualties were reported . Another Fmln missile was fired from Las Piedras Hill, in the same area, against another Salvadoran Air Force 0-2 airplane, but the airplane was not damaged .

1574,TST3-MUC4-0075,SAN SALVADOR,,"Marco Antonio Guevara, of the``up to date""newscast . How do the five Presidents conceive the demobilization of the Fmln? How does the Salvadoran government conceive this happening? I believe there have been substantial changes in this Presidential meeting as compared to previous meetings . to explain this better, Marco Antonio, we must say we will not fall into what has been used in the past, that is, the famous symmetry . on this occasion, we have been very clear and categorical when we said that we were not willing to continue contributing sacrifices and other things from the Salvadoran government in order to solve the Nicaraguan problem exclusively . We demanded uniformity, and any other country confronting the aggression of an irregular force--any other country in Central America--also has the right to be treated in a uniform manner, as far as measures and criteria that may be adopted in the Presidential meetings . that is why today for the first time you are seeing how the measures adopted for the Nicaraguan resistance--that had been granted most of the attention up to now--are also being adopted for the Fmln . We cannot allow a country to claim it is the only target of an aggression by an irregular armed force supported from abroad . here in El Salvador we now have greater evidence following this 11 November terrorist aggression that the Fmln is a movement that can survive only with support from abroad, and that it obeys and exists because of international movements . in the second place, it has demonstrated that it only has the capacity to generate terrorism, which has been mentioned in this document . We cannot continue just talking about demobilization and pacification in Nicaragua . It is time to apply this to all irregular groups, be it the Urng in Guatemala, or any other irregular armed group that may come up and may try to hinder the democratic process in the area . We see this as something that has gone deep into the minds of all the central American Presidents, and from now on, we will have greater uniformity in treating all of those irregular groups that operate in the region . Rene Hurtado of El Mundo . Mr President, following the Tela and Costa del Sol meetings, Nicaragua has changed its stand . In Costa Rica, president Ortega was asked if he had sold out the Fmln in exchange for the demobilization of the Contras and other results of the summit in favor of Nicaragua . I would like to know your opinion about this, and also how you interpret the fact that President Ortega has accepted some issues about the Fmln that he did not allow in Tela or Costa del Sol? on the other hand, will the demobilization of the Fmln be the result of a dialogue or negotiations later on? in the first place, I believe that Daniel Ortega was unable to pull any more tricks out of his hat, and he was facing a fact he could no longer hide: he is the one who is spreading armed revolutions in Central America and trying to hamper democratic processes in the region . once more he has been caught not honoring the commitments agreed on in Tela, but rather violating these commitments . on this occasion he has been left with no possible defense . Therefore, in our opinion, he has no option other than to accept the reality of what is happening in Central America, or see himself totally isolated amid a peace plan that has international support . This situation would cause him many problems and headaches in political and diplomatic matters."
1575,TST3-MUC4-0076,CLANDESTINE,1989-12-13,"Comrades: a new element that we must analyze and explain emerged at the conclusion of the central American Presidents' emergency meeting . Let us see first why the meeting took place . The main reason is the very complicated predicament in which our offensive has placed Cristiani and the high command . As you will remember, the government has met with much International disrepute and isolation because of the brutal assassination of Jesuit priests and the bombing of the civilian population . Let us recall, as a significant fact, that the United Nations has condemned the government because of all it has done, especially because of the latest atrocities . on that occasion, El Salvador was the only country that voted against that resolution while 96 countries voted in favor . We mention this case as a most significant one, but the fact is that there has been so much worldwide condemnation that the dictatorship has found itself in a really desperate situation . This was a cause of concern for the North Americans . to whom could they turn at a time when all international organizations had turned their backs on Cristiani? the North Americans had to resort to some forum that would not condemn the Genocidal regime and that, on the contrary, would provide support in spite of all the atrocities the regime has committed . The most suitable idea was to promote an emergency meeting of central American Presidents, because in Central America, as we all know, the North Americans have had their backyard and most of these countries serve their interests . The meeting was called to try to pull Cristiani out of international isolation . Under what conditions did summit take place? we have to say first that the Presidents of El Salvador and Costa Rica, and probably of Guatemala, had reached an agreement prior to the meeting . the subject of the discussion was a document drafted by Arias and Cerezo . This document expressed support for Cristiani from the very beginning . Joseph Sullivan, a U.S. State Department official in charge of Latin American affairs, as well as other U.S. State Department officials, were present at the meeting . The Costa Rican ambassador to Nicaragua--a Pro-U.S. man who introduced the Nicaraguan Contras at the meeting--was also present, conspiring all the time . The Fmln was not even allowed to enter Costa Rica . However, in spite of the fact that the meeting had been fixed and in spite of the U.S . presence, the agreement to support Cristiani was achieved almost at the price of killing the Esquipulas agreement . It was not easy . The U.S. will to condemn the Fmln and to back Cristiani prevailed in the midst of much bickering and the insolence of the Honduran President . As you can see, it was not easy to find support for the Genocidal regime even in places where the North Americans think they have the bull by the horns . Let us see, as a third point, in what the Declaration consists."

Here is the second part of the news conference featuring Das director general Miguel Maza Marquez . The Das has evidence showing that this individual Masterminded two attacks including the the most recent and worst one in which more than 60 innocent people were killed . How do you know that Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha Masterminded the recent attack on Das? because the investigations that we have conducted along with the national police ever since the attack occurred point in that direction . If we compare the modus Operandi of Rodriguez and his people, we come to the conclusion that the period between the and the action itself are very similar . Furthermore, this man was in there celebrating the genocide that he had committed in Bogota . because the intelligence reports indicate this, and according to certain statements we have, he was Overjoyed by the damage that he had caused in the city given the large number of people who were killed; seeing him Sunbathing and swimming on the Atlantic coast led us to believe this . is this a police reaction to the drug traffickers' attack on Das? no, I am not saying that it is a reaction .

1580,TST3-MUC4-0081,LIMA,,"Good evening . I have called this news conference to read a foreign Ministry communique: today the Panamanian government told Luis Sandiga Cabrera, our charge D'Affaires in Panama, that he must leave Panama in 72 hours . 2 . We have expressed to the Panamanian government, through the Panamanian charge D'Affaires in Lima, our surprise and strong protest over that decision . 3 . In view of this decision, the Peruvian government has decided to reduce the personnel of its diplomatic mission in Panama and to maintain its relations with that country at the first Secretary level . Peru will in this way continue to fulfill the humanitarian mission of protecting those who have sought asylum in its embassy in Panama while the Panamanian government issues the Safe-Conducts that we requested in accordance to the convention on diplomatic Asylum signed in Caracas on 28 March 1954 . Peru is contacting the members of the permanent mechanism for consultation and political agreement to explain the situation and to ask for solidarity and cooperation in overcoming this momentary crisis . The delicate situation regarding the people at the Peruvian Embassy has provoked our justified alarm and impelled us to begin talks to ensure that their diplomatic Asylum will be respected . We have talked with the ambassadors from the countries of the permanent mechanism for consultation and political agreement . I have personally spoken with the ambassadors of Venezuela, Mexico, and Colombia . I am now ready to answer any questions: Mr Larco Cox, unofficial sources have said that the people in the Peruvian embassy in Panama are not exactly political refugees but common criminals . What do you say about this? the country that grants Asylum determines this . We have been very careful to review each one of them and their files . We have checked to see if any of them were facing any trials in Panama or the United States . Our investigation has revealed that none of them are facing any trials . The charges were made afterward . We see this as a result of the emotional climate presently existing in Panama . What is your personal opinion of the incident? it is the diplomatic way to express a protest over what they have been led to believe . According to Panamanian reports, charge D'Affaires Luis Sandiga has made statements on the situation that did not please the government . The truth is that Sandiga has not made any declarations . However, former Ambassador Castro arenas is in Panama and he has embarked on a campaign in which he is seeking retaliation against the Peruvian government . He could not think of anything better than to point at Sandiga as the person responsible for alleged statements . Sandiga has not said a word about the situation because that is not his job . Besides, his car and the car belonging to one of the embassy's military attaches have been stolen; there is no way to begin an investigation . are you saying that former Ambassador Castro arenas is directly responsible for the situation? you can make your own conclusions . If the situation deteriorates, will Peru recall all of its personnel from Panama? we cannot go to that extreme because we are fulfilling a humanitarian cause, as we said in the communique . Our first responsibility at this time is to see that the right of Asylum is respected . As long as the refugees remain in the embassy, we will maintain our representation at the level of first Secretary."

We have viewed with great concern the government and Army's rejection Mr Perez de Cuellar's participation in the dialogue - negotiation process as a mediator . This attitude is an obstacle to a process that could facilitate the negotiation effort . on our part, we have accepted this mediation and we have undertaken efforts to achieve it . 2 . The state of siege, the assassination of social Democratic leader Hector Oqueli, the doubtful and insufficient initial results in the case of the Jesuit priests, the absence of conditions for the political activity of the opposition, the continuation of the persecution of churches, and the lack of freedom of speech through the direct or covert gagging of the press show that Cristiani's government is carrying out a policy of confrontation with all the country's social and political forces . for this reason, the terms of the dialogue - negotiation must be reoriented so that it will be turned into a national process with the participation of all those forces . 3 . We view as gravely erroneous the persistence of a government policy based on the idea of the Fmln's alleged military weakness . This position, similar to the one that was put forth prior to 11 November will only lead the country to greater levels of confrontation . 4 . We reaffirm our willingness to hold the meeting of both sides with the UN Secretary General soon . We hope that Mr Cristiani's visit to the United Nations will lead to such a meeting and that we can agree with the mediator on the date to hold it . 5 . We believe that the U.S. aid to the Salvadoran government is directed against democratization and a political solution . The sending of signals to one or another sector of the government or Army, using the pressure of setting conditions or threatening the end of aid, does not resolve the problem . We believe the members of the U.S. Congress can make an important contribution to end the war in our country by agreeing to suspend that aid, something which could form part of a negotiated agreement that would simultaneously entail a cease-fire .

This is, however, a critical moment for the Salvadoran President, and he knows it . But this point was also stressed by the large numbers of people who Booed him at nearly every large U.S. city he visited . Although the ghosts of the assassinated Jesuits shadowed him all during his tour, the arena representative, just as his predecessor Jose Napoleon Duarte did, flew to the United States to try to convince the legislators, particularly the Democrats, that he intends to resume the dialogue for peace and check the Army's criminal aspirations . waving the human rights flag has been the most important thing for Cristiani, particularly because he is aware that with this action he can continue to receive Washington's financial support for his government . According to to some experts, Cristiani went farther than his predecessor . He asked the UN Secretary General to help in the resumption of talks with the guerrillas, replaced several military officers of doubtful reputation, and assured he will punish severely eight soldiers accused of Assassinating the six Jesuit priests . We must keep in mind that, prior to his trip, the Salvadoran President succeeded in curbing a coup attempt staged by Army reactionary groups . members of the Salvadoran opposition have coincided in ther view that never before had a head of state challenged the military hierarchy to such an extent, a hierarchy that opposes all negotiation with the guerrillas . The experts also said, however, that the country's internal situation has never been so serious . The rebel offensive launched in November is a landmark, after which everything will be different in El Salvador, beginning with the government party, which was left in a very delicate situation in the eyes of influential U.S. power circles . The guerrilla drive also demonstrated that only two alternatives are left for the country . If serious peace negotiations are not initiated, the Counterinsurgency policy will be aggravated . This could even give the United States a pretext to intervene directly in the country . Although President George Bush said he would continue to aid El Salvador, a large number of legislators for a long time have been questioning what use has been nearly $4 billion delivered to the Salvadoran Army in 10 years of war . If for the White House the alternative is to continue to give military aid to El Salvador or resign itself to an eventual victory of the rebels, for Cristiani the situation is even more difficult because, to get more money, he must ensure that human rights are respected . This is equivalent to influencing the most reactionary military officers and guaranteeing the fulfillment of the famous economic recovery plan advocated by his party . These points are nearly impossible to comply with in a country immersed in war . If the economy is weak, respect for human rights is even weaker . anyway, the U.S. government is planning to increase aid for the Salvadoran government .

We believe it constitutes the most expedient way to achieve peace in the country, and we are going to continue along that path . Aida Montalvo . in regard to the renegotiation of the foreign debt, when are you planning to go to Mexico, and how will the Salvadoran debt with that country be renegotiated? the timetable for the trip is still undecided . There is not definite date . I think it may take place in April or may of this year . Our first scheduled visit will be to Venezuela . Carlos Mario Marquez of Agence France Presse . social aspects . I would like to know what the status is of that, since some support having primary meetings and then a summit, so to speak? I do not think that is the cause of that problem . We said that the resumption of the talks must take place when the Fmln enters the dialogue process with a serious attitude . We maintain our stance that they must stop all violence that is directly and indirectly affecting civilians, that is, all the terrorist activities the Fmln conducts . This is a small request that obtained the support of all the central American Presidents at the San Isidro Coronado meeting in Costa Rica . I think that this is the cause of the problem . They have asked for changes in format, and we said we had no problem with most of the requests we have received . We are now waiting for the Fmln, since they asked for time to analyze things a little before having the meeting . We are awaiting the visit of Mr. de Soto in early March . Obviously, the dialogue has not taken place because there are some differences, . I think the chief difference is that the Fmln does not want to agree to stop terrorist actions, and that is why there is no dialogue now . Epigmenio Ibarra . Mr. President, yesterday in Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega said at a rally that he will wage a constructive opposition . He said that the revolution did not die with the elections . He said that the Sandinist National liberation front will rule from below . We sense a pretty complex climate for the transition in Nicaragua . What do you think about Daniel Ortega's statements? How do you view the possibility that there may be a true transition from power to power instead of a transition of government in Nicaragua? as I have said before, statements by Ortega and other representatives of the Sandinist front are a source of concern . They could indicate that the elections may have been very free and honest, but also a farce as far as improving the democratic process is concerned . The Nicaraguan people would be denied the right to freely pick their rulers and the right of these rulers to act as they deem best . I would say that the Nicaraguan revolution belongs not just to the Fsln . The Fsln was one of the participants in the revolution in Nicaragua against Anastasio Somoza . The fact is that a consensus existed among all sectors that supported that revolution . The Fsln has no monopoly on or exclusive control over that revolution . I believe that in ideological terms there are differences between the views of Ms. Chamorro and Uno, that is, the new Government-Elect, and the views of the Fsln . Yet, the people picked the government . It is worrisome to hear some statements that the Fsln will rule from below . We believe they would seek to do that by keeping control over the Army . Let me repeat: there is nothing Democratic about a political party controlling the Army . The Army must respond to the government and the country's democratic process, and not to just one political party . We believe things have not been settled yet . We believe that there are still many things left pending."

According to the observers, this clarification came in reply to statements made by Cerezo that the U.S . position in this regard differs from that of most countries within the international community: all these actions the United States pointing the finger to human rights issues are aimed at in Geneva, because I have the impression that what it wants at this time is to have Guatemala condemned and to a certain extent Tarnish our international image, because the success of the Esquipulas II plan gave Guatemala, as an autonomous and independent country, a lot of room for action . that is what it wants to do, because it is not good for large countries to see countries like Guatemala, with a certain degree of autonomy and independence, achieve historic successes by showing that our country is right in discussions with certain U.S. groups . They now want . My personal opinion is that they now sort of want to get back at us for the Esquipulas II plan . In reply to these statements by President Cerezo, the U.S. Embassy pointed out in its communique of 6 March that the U.S. government had supported the Esquipulas II peace process from the very beginning . It added that ever since the signing of the Esquipulas accord, Guatemala has received $600 million in U.S. aid . This shows, according to the embassy, that U.S. support for Guatemalan democracy continued to be strong after the signing of the Esquipulas II document . In any case, from President Cerezo's perspective the U.S . attitude in this situation reflects the traditional inclination of that country's governments throughout history to dictate rules to other nations regarding what they should do . Cerezo compared Guatemala's situation in matters of criminal investigation to the situation in several U.S. cities where the police are unable to control crime . as an example, he cited Washington, D.C., where assaults, murders, and crimes frequently related to drug consumption have reached very astonishing levels in the past few years . As for the departure of Ambassador Strook, Cerezo said that the diplomat has not been withdrawn from Guatemala, but returned to the United States for consultations by order of the State Department . In statements made minutes after receiving the credentials of the new Frg Ambassador, however, Cerezo said that his return was, to a certain extent, due to a decision we made."

The Mexican embassy in Panama city has announced that it has granted diplomatic asylum to Rafael Arosemena, former manager of the National Bank of Panama . However, the Panamanian authorities have confirmed that they would not grant him a Safeconduct to leave the country, and they sent a note to the Mexican Embassy urging it to desist from offering him protection .

Meanwhile, Heraclides Sucre and Gonzalo Gonzalez, former majors in the now defunct defense forces, have sought Asylum at the Peruvian embassy in Panama city . They are accused of killing major Moises Giroldi, who led the foiled coup d'etat against Noriega in October 1989 .``We are willing to pay whatever price is necessary to enforce the law, because these political refugees are common criminals and they have no right to that benefit ,""Linares stated when asked by Critica Libre if Panama would be willing to stop the people who have sought Asylum at the Mexican and Peruvian embassies from leaving the country without facing a trial for the crimes they reportedly perpetrated during the previous regime . Linares said that Panama will maintain its position of not granting Safe-Conducts to these refugees, even if the Mexican and Peruvian government insist on granting them diplomatic Asylum, and admitted that this will likely create an international conflict . Nevertheless, Linares said that he hopes there will be no need to break diplomatic relations with either of these countries, which insist on keeping former collaborators of former Gen Noriega as refugees, and he emphasized the need to reach an understanding with these nations .``We hope that relations with Mexico will not cool off or reach a breaking point given the affection that unites us as free nations ,""Linares added . He revealed that the Peruvian Embassy sent a note to the Panamanian government stating that it will continue to give Diplomati protection to the refugees in its embassy, because legal proceedings were started against them after they had been accepted by the diplomatic mission .``We are preparing a note of reply to the Peruvian government ,""foreign minister Linares said . The following persons are still refugees at the Ecuadoran Embassy: former public works Minister Rene Bultron, former labor Minister Cesar Martans, former National mortgage bank manager Julio Shaik, former Irhe director Leovigildo Herrrera, and former tourism director Bernardo Dominguez . last week the foreign minister reviewed the possibility of granting Safe-Conducts to five of these former officials in the previous regime, provided there is no case pending against them .

The message reads as follows: Carlos Pizarro's murder is a monstrous crime that has cut short the life of a man who had shown his will for peace and his commitment to Colombia . The crime was directed at hindering the development of the electoral process and destroying the reconciliation process that the government and M-19 carefully constructed, surpassing many obstacles . In this case, as in many others, this painful tragedy should serve to consolidate the ideals of peace and pluralism for which so many COLOMBIANS have struggled--one of them, Carlos Pizarro .

It was recently reported that several officers who testified during these investigations are now attending training courses abroad . It was also reported that the military school's registration book for persons entering or leaving the premises had been lost, including the pages that correspond to November 1989 . today, Cristiani talked about this matter and said the judge should continue to investigate and not just make statements concerning the problems . I do not believe there is any problem in the officers returning to the country if a judge orders that they come to testify . all that is required is for the judge to summon them; they would be brought to the country to testify and, after that, returned to their training courses . groups of soldiers are frequently sent abroad to take training courses to make them more professional; this applies not only to personnel from the military school, but from all armed forces units . concerning the other matter, the judge has to investigate it . I believe that instead of just staying there, the judge should continue to search for evidence . tell me, what is the difference if they are brought back from Suchitoto or from the United States if they must testify before the judge? there is no difference at all . The President spoke today at the El Salvador military airport before he left for Costa Rica to attend the Inauguration ceremony of President-elect Rafael Calderon Fournier . He also said that the United States conditioning 50 percent of the aid given to our country could cause the Rebel front to increase their actions . He accused the Fmln of using dialogue for tactical reasons . We have stated that an action of this type would be very untimely, as it could make the most radical Fmln members decide to continue the war and, thus, hinder the dialogue process . However, pressure government for them with Fmln . I would ask the question: who has always showed goodwill and sincerely sought an agreement and who has not done this? history shows that in the past, the Fmln has used the proposals by Duarte's government and my own for tactical reasons . It has not been the governments . I believe that the Fmln must understand and be pressured to really search for a political solution . also today, the UN Secretary General authorized a spokesman to announce that talks between the government and Fmln will be renewed on 16 May . The panorama that surrounds this new encounter, however, presents an entirely different pattern from meetings in the past, because both sectors have met with political parties represented at the . Furthermore, although the government has not done the same with the country's social forces, the rebels will try to do so this week . Undoubtedly, the results that could be obtained from the dialogue could be much more important than those obtained during past negotiations, because almost all the sectors that have become involved, directly or indirectly, in the negotiating demand that the agreements attained be based on internal cooperation."

The incident occurred at 0100 on 26 August at the intersection of West 1ST Street and North 51st Avenue . Col Golcher was supposedly in Israel where he was sent as the Salvadoran government's military attache; however, the well-known leader of the death squads was seen at 0100 in downtown San Salvador accompanied by none other than the U.S. military representative in our country . This happened only hours after Colonel Majano's Bodyguards were murdered . The circumstances surrounding this incident raise several questions . What were these two soldiers doing at 0100? Where were Golcher's Bodyguards? Where were his companion's Bodyguards? the two men were probably returning from a corruption center, a night club--one of those exclusive clubs where the U.S. advisers and other U.S. and Salvadoran government officials spend the dollars they steal from the funds allotted to El Salvador and where they plan crimes against the people . much more could be said; however, the truth is that the incident was no mere accident . Mrs Platero is another victim of the madness affecting an Army directed by U.S. advisers . There is not much difference between this incident and the hurling of a grenade by a soldier driven crazy by the psychological terrorism practiced by the Army advisers and Chiefs . There is no doubt in our minds that Golcher will not be tried for this new crime, just as he has not been tried for the many crimes he has been responsible for as chief of the repressive Corps and death squads."

1610,TST4-MUC4-0011,MANAGUA ,1988-08-09,"Dear Mr President: on the road toward achieving peace, we have often experienced setbacks and difficult times . powerful forces are trying to justify violence and war every time diplomatic channels or commitments are not followed or met . When there is an armed struggle and when thousands are killed on the battlefield, those who promote violence never conclude from those useless killings that war is futile . they do not believe that peace can be achieved through dialogue and negotiation . It will always be easier to rectify mistakes when the weaknesses are political or when errors are made on the road to peace . We cannot bring the dead back to life, and violence born of hatred takes a long time to heal . I believe, Mr President, that it would be encouraging if you were to rectify some political decisions your government made following the unfortunate incidents at Nandaime . It is important to reopen the communications media that are closed . It is necessary to release the prisoners and to revoke the sentences imposed upon them as punishment for involvement in those incidents . The peace plan to which we are committed obliges us to restore confidence as soon as possible . Our most sacred commitment is to continue progressing on the path toward democratization . It is imperative that your government and the Nicaraguan Contras resume negotiations to secure a permanent end to military actions in Nicaragua . This could very well be an encouraging example for many Central American and other countries . I offer you our Costa Rican territory for the resumption of such negotiations . I also offer you all the assistance within my means to enable such negotiations to take place . I understand that you will attend the upcoming inaugural ceremony in Ecuador . I believe it would be a sign of confidence in the future of peace, a noble gesture toward Rodrigo Borja, and would aid in strengthening the Ecuadoran democratic process if you attended the ceremony in Quito after reversing the setbacks incurred as a result of Antidemocratic actions, such as penalizing the communications media and depriving men and women of their liberty . only if we have the strength to correct our mistakes and the vision to continue on the path outlined in the peace plan can central Americans prevent the continuance of the armed aggression against our peoples . A Latin American commitment to peace also requires efforts to achieve independence and democracy . We will not be granted another political opportunity to forge history . It is unlikely that there will be a new opportunity for reconciliation to allow today's youth a different future, a new opportunity to put aside their weapons and to work for a better future."

1622,TST4-MUC4-0023,PANAMA CITY ,1988-09-26,"The plan included several points . The purpose of this plan was to pressure general Noriega to resign from his military post in late August . The psychological objectives of this plan were: to intensify and spread the repudiation of Noriega within the FDP; to intensify and spread the repudiation of Noriega's collaborators by mentioning specific names; to convince Noriega that he had lost FDP support and that his regime was unsustainable; to convince Noriega's Panamanian collaborators that he had lost FDP support and that his regime was unsustainable; to convince foreign governments and Noriega allies, particularly Cuba and Nicaragua, that he had lost FDP support and that his government was unsustainable; to convince governments that were hostile to Noriega, especially Venezuela and Colombia, that he had lost FDP support and that his regime was unsustainable; to convince foreign revolutionary movements that dealt with Noriega, such as the Fmln and the M-19, that he had lost FDP support and that his regime was unsustainable; and to move the anti-Noriega sector within the FDP to support specific actions against Noriega's regime . The FDP members, officers, and troops were the targets of this plan . We see how some were taken in by the psychological operations plan . The targets of this plan were Gen Noriega, Noriega's Panamanian collaborators within the FDP, some civilians, foreign governments that are Noriega's allies, foreign governments that are hostile to Noriega, and foreign revolutionary organizations that deal with Noriega . They identified all of Noriega's Vulnerabilities, as well as the Vulnerabilities of all the targets we have already mentioned . There were certain themes used in these psychological operations, and the media fell for them many times . This is why we repeatedly asked them not to fall for this misinformation . These themes included: by imposing his arbitrary nature and corruption, Noriega is Perverting the FDP and promoting the disintegration of that military institution . The FDP have become a mafia that is heading toward disgrace . This is a topic that has been discussed in leaflets and many publications . by disrupting the constitutional order at his whim, Noriega is provoking a profound social, economic, and political crisis that is ruining the country . This is done to hide those who are truly responsible for the crisis we are experiencing . The longer Noriega remains in power, the more probable becomes a U.S., Cuban, or Soviet intervention . The domestic and international conflicts provoked by Noriega negatively affect the personal well-being of the FDP members and their families . Noriega's fall is inevitable and the FDP should not fall with him . to save the FDP and the Republic of Panama, the FDP must remove Noriega from office . This is why there were siren songs that an internal coup was under way . The state security organizations have been following this case for 5 months and we know the fugitives are in the United States . We know where they left from . No one can deny the Association of certain U.S. citizens who are involved in this operation with the Panamanian groups that were captured . We have the evidence, the weapons, the instruments used for misinformation, the plans, and the maps with the targets for violence . important people who were going to be kidnapped had also been marked on these maps . They had marked the bridges that were to be destroyed . gentlemen, we know the power of weapons and we know how to use them . We know the damage they can do . Therefore, before there was a violent confrontation between the Panamanian people and their FDP, we went one step ahead of their plans . If arrests were made, it was because we wanted to avoid a confrontation with inexperienced groups that allowed themselves to be used for the personal benefit of those who received, with a siren song, the promise of the Panamanian people's $30 million that Eric Arturo Delvalle was going to use for subversive acts, bloody acts to bathe our people in blood, as in the case of the struggle of our brother countries in Latin and central America . We will not permit that . that is why we decided to go one step ahead and foil these plans that have a certain purpose and that would result in mourning and pain for Panamanian families . We have the evidence and those who were arrested were damn well arrested: Alberto conte, Fred Boyd, and all those people who have been working behind the scenes so Eduardo Herrera and friends can live like Kings in the United Statets, so they can live their lives drinking champagne and eating pheasant . Eduardo Herrera was dismissed from a diplomatic post for smuggling 40 boxes of whiskey per week into Israel . He is the kind of person protected by the Pentagon and Elliott Abrams . He is Elliott Abrams' hero . Theresa Wellington of the embassy in Mexico, who gave these people--who left Panama for Mexico--their Visas in 10 minutes by Abrams' orders, has also become one of our people's enemies."

The explosion occurred in Alto de San Pablo while gasoline and propane gas were being pumped to Bucaramanga . We have a report now from Teresa Rueda . communications to and from Puerto Petrolero and Bucaramanga have been cut off since early today, after an attempt to dynamite the multipurpose pipeline destroyed a 100-Meter section of the central highway . The supply of gas to Bucaramanga will also be affected by this event . It is estimated that it will take at least 3 days to restore normal traffic, because it will be necessary to use dynamite to remove rocks currently blocking the highway . The attempted sabotage occurred at the 65-Km mark on the Bucaramanga - Barrancabermeja highway , 20 km from the place where a military convoy was ambushed last Wednesday . This is the second time that an attempted sabotage of the Bucaramanga - Barrancabermeja multipurpose pipeline, which carries propane gas, gasoline, and Acpm has taken place . The explosion destroyed a 30-Meter section of pipeline, and sparked a fire that has not yet been extinguished . losses caused by the sabotage, which has been attributed to the ELN, have yet to be ascertained . It is estimated that repairs to the highway alone will cost the public works Ministry 5 million pesos . Well, after initial talks with Ecopetrol technicians today, beginning at 1700, after the fire is under control, they will begin restoring service on the oil pipeline . at this time, there is traffic congestion near the Sugamoso bridge . While still on the subject, Ecopetrol's president, who traveled this morning to Barrancabermeja to attend a forum on the Magdalena River, reported that, so far this year, terrorist attacks have cost his company $300 million . We have this report from Maria Clara Gracia . Ecopetrol has lost 95 billion pesos in revenues this year due to the 44 terrorist attacks on the Cano Limon - Covenas oil pipeline . In these attacks , 13.2 million barrels of crude oil have been lost . The areas most affected by these attacks are in Sucre, Arauca, Norte de Santander, and Santander departments . doctor, could these terrorist attacks lead to an increase in fuel prices in Colombia? Obviously, there will come a time when, faced with increasing internal production costs and falling revenues, we are going to have to consider compensating our losses with an increase in domestic oil prices, but that is a measure we are not about to adopt at this time . today's landslide, which destroyed a section of the multipurpose pipeline between Barrancabermeja and Bucaramanga, has resulted in estimated losses totalling 1.435 billion pesos."

In addition, it has just been reported that El Siglo, the Communist party newspaper, will be published again legally . Asked about the present conditions of the struggle, Teitelboim said that the progressive forces in Chile, who had to pay a high price for their resistance in the Pinochet's 15-year rule, continue to be exposed to persecution, imprisonment, and threats of murder . The Communist party, which has had the largest number of casualties and missing and tortured people since the dictatorship was established, continues to be banned . Nonetheless, the country is caught up in a wave of mobilization of the people . Volodia Teitelboim confirmed that the Communist party supports the demand made by the opposition alliance to hold the Presidential elections promised by the military junta for late 1989 at an earlier date, and to nominate a common presidential candidate . In addition, the Constitution--on the basis of which Pinochet intends to continue in office until March 1990 despite his defeat through the referendum--must be abolished to allow the people to decide on the country's future in freedom . Volodia Teitelboim paid tribute to the GDR's consistent position in word and deed as a great example of international solidarity with the Chilean people . He said that hundreds of patriots from his country have found a temporary home in the GDR, where they can live and work."

Nevertheless, Vallejo did not rule out the possibility of holding talks with the guerrillas to achieve peace in the country . Febres-Cordero's administration refused to hold talks with the Alfaro lives dammit and free homeland Montoneras guerrilla groups because it considered them to be terrorist groups; it actually attacked these groups to the point of almost eliminating them . Vallejo pointed out that holding talks with the guerrillas would be a positive step . He recalled that the Colombian administration of Belisario Betancur began a dialogue with genuine revolutionary armies to achieve peace in that country . He asked: why can we not hold talks here, where the guerrillas are still at an embryonic phase? the possibility of Government-Guerrillas talks has been viewed differently . National Congress President Wilfrido Lucero said on 25 November that the Congress is neither Tasked nor empowered to hold talks with the guerrillas . Lucero refused to comment on the alleged talks, saying that he has received no information in this regard . He added: these kinds of problems are under the jurisdiction of others; it is not a concern of the National Congress . According to Julio Cesar Trujillo, a former president of popular democracy, talks with guerrillas would be good for the country because they have useful ideas, some of which could be implemented . He added that not everything advocated by the guerrillas can be carried out because there are obstacles facing the good offices of the current rulers . Meanwhile, the social Christian party of former President Leon Febres-Cordero expressed concern over this possibility . It will meet tomorrow to discuss the topic and issue an statement . Marco Lara, president of that party and public information Secretary during the previous administration, refused to comment on this .

What are the armed forces doing to guarantee the people's welfare? the Salvadoran people's concern about increased terrorist violence is understandable . We must bear in mind that terrorist acts always escalate when important events are expected . This does not happen only in our country; we recently saw it in Seoul, before the Olympics, when groups resorted to violence to provoke the authorities and prevent an international event from taking place . An OAS meeting is scheduled to take place in this country in a few days . The event is being threatened by a number of acts, particularly terrorist acts in the San Benito, Max Diaz, Escalon, and San Francisco neighborhoods . The terrorists believe the people will protest against the OAS meeting if they cause terror in those areas . We are expecting foreign ministers from Latin America, Central America, and the United States, whom the terrorists believe will call off the meeting because of the situation in the country . that is the main reason for the increased violence . You have seen that we have increased patrol operations recently . patrols are also being carried out around the Volcanoes near San Salvador . security measures are also being implemented on the periphery of San Salvador and around the meeting Venue, but I cannot give you the details . There is also a complete security plan for the officials who will participate in the OAS meeting . We are ready to reduce the possibility of an incident to a minimum . However, I have always been honest and I must admit there is always the possibility of sabotage or a terrorist act . This does not necessarily mean that it will affect the security measures in the area of the meeting . for example, a blackout can be caused by cutting off an electric line in a distant area . General, the Fmln's attacks have not been so overwhelming in the past, yet now those attacks are attaining considerable military success . do the Fmln's military actions mean it is superior to the armed forces? we cannot conceive their military superiority under any circumstances . I have noticed the guerrilla leaders are currently visiting different countries, particularly the Contadora group members . They are trying to gain support for reading a statement at the OAS meeting, and they are also trying to pressure the Salvadoran government into negotiating with them . This proves the rebels have failed militarily, and that failure has been brought about by our large-scale operations in northern Chalatenango Department and Usulutan Department, in the east of the country . The rebels have tried to bring the war to urban areas . However, the plans of subversive groups--I showed you the documents on their fire plan in another meeting--did not include the type of terrorist acts that we have seen lately . Instead, they planned a general uprising and strike before the elections . This proves, as I said, that the subversives could not develop their fire plan . They have carried out several acts but they have failed to achieve the expected results . This is like having a cinema show a movie every day with no-one turning up to see it . The subversives are trying to carry out this type of event right now to give the impression of military strength, so the OAS will pass a resolution recommending negotiation to solve the conflict . Furthermore, the rebels are trying to discredit the democratic process and boycott our next elections because some people are demoralized by terrorism and lack the will to participate in politics, which makes the election results unsatisfactory."

One option is to keep on doing``more of the same ,""to ignore the new context that has developed since 5 October, to defuse the monetary time bomb and to apply a tight Tourniquet to the economy to prevent renewed outbreaks of higher prices . The inflation``Bogeyman""is beginning to make his presence felt, and explanations abound . Gerardo Aceituno, the head of the forecasting workshop of the labor economy program, attributes the mounting inflationary pressures to the impact of the wage hike and higher international interest rates on domestic prices . He recalls that the prices of farm products have been``virtually frozen for a year""and that this explains the huge gap between the wholesale price index, which fell one percent during the past 12 months, and the CPI, which rose 12 percent during the same period .``the situation could not be sustained, except if businessmen wanted to sacrifice their profit margins, which have so far not been affected, because the VAT was cut .""Juan Villarzu, in contrast, places most of the blame for the inflationary pressures on the excessive quantity of money . Oddly enough, however, the uncertainty that developed after the victory of the no vote is presumably having an effect somewhat similar to the``Mini-Adjustment .""he reports that Small- and medium-sized businessmen are postponing their investment plans, and thus their demand for credit has fallen off . The dilemma facing them and other``economic agents""is whether to spend the money or to deposit it . The central bank comes into play here, because``not having to compete with the banks, it can begin soaking up some of the money in circulation without boosting interest rates too much . Moreover, they are already quite high : 5 percent for 90-day operations, as against 4.2 percent during the first half .""in addition, it could resort to its sizable monetary reserves and``burn up""foreign exchange on higher imports to absorb some of the excess liquidity .``I'm thinking about devaluations somewhat similar to the ones this year .""options after the no victory in any event, the large mass of money in circulation and the existing inflationary pressures``constitute an explosive situation ,""which according to Villarzu the government will not ignore . because``If it has any political accomplishment left, it is the victory over inflation .""and the tightening up will be even more severe if the Finance Minister insists on achieving a 5-percent rise in the CPI in 1989, as the draft budget sent to the junta calls for . Even the central bank regards this goal as dangerous .

The leftist leader described this terrorist Escalade as one of the major obstacles to the region's achieving the social pact that it urgently needs .

It is expected that Alan Garcia and Alva Castro may reach an agreement on the way the government should be run until 1990, when the current Presidential term will end following new general elections . Garcia also lost the Presidency of the political Commission that sets the party's political line . This post was won by Luis Alberto Sanchez , 88, first vice president of the nation and one of the Mainsprings in the changeover operation within the Apra . The other elective positions were filled with Apra members who do not follow Garcia's line . Thus, the presence of Alan Garcia within the party was reduced to being member of the political Commission in his capacity as former party Secretary General . two days ago, the Peruvian chief of state resigned the Apra Presidency, upset over criticism directed at him during the opening of the party Congress . He thus responded to obvious signs that the party President post would be eliminated . The Apra had thought Alan Garcia would be a very capable heir to Victor Raul Haya de la Torre, the party's founder and historical leader, who died in 1979 . three and one-half years after Garcia's election victory, the party disqualified Garcia for the role of Haya de la Torre's successor because of his errors and his failure to rectify his government line . following the tradition initiated by Alan Garcia, new Apra leader Luis Alva Castro will be sworn in as Secretary General this coming Friday before the tomb of Haya de la Torre in the northern city of Trujillo, the Apra's main bastion . The economic crisis, marked by 2,000-Percent inflation and a 20-Percent recession from October 1987 to October 1988, is compounded by social instability and political violence, with killings averaging four per day . An internal political storm hit the Apra 16th National Congress, and vice president Sanchez said that he cannot recall anything similar . During the last session of the Congress, three youths were injured in a melee among Apra people . other party members were hit on the head with handgun butts, and three newsmen--who had not been allowed to attend the proceedings of the Congress--were attacked."
