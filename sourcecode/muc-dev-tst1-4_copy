DEV-MUC3-0001	SAN SALVADOR, 3 JAN 90 -- THE ARCE BATTALION COMMAND HAS REPORTED THAT ABOUT 50 PEASANTS OF VARIOUS AGES HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED BY TERRORISTS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT IN SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT. ACCORDING TO THAT GARRISON, THE MASS KIDNAPPING TOOK PLACE ON 30 DECEMBER IN SAN LUIS DE LA REINA. THE SOURCE ADDED THAT THE TERRORISTS FORCED THE INDIVIDUALS, WHO WERE TAKEN TO AN UNKNOWN LOCATION, OUT OF THEIR RESIDENCES, PRESUMABLY TO INCORPORATE THEM AGAINST THEIR WILL INTO CLANDESTINE GROUPS. MEANWHILE, THREE SUBVERSIVES WERE KILLED AND SEVEN OTHERS WERE WOUNDED DURING CLASHES YESTERDAY IN USULUTAN AND MORAZAN DEPARTMENTS. THE ATONAL BATTALION REPORTED THAT ONE EXTREMIST WAS KILLED AND FIVE OTHERS WERE WOUNDED DURING A CLASH YESTERDAY AFTERNOON NEAR LA ESPERANZA FARM, SANTA ELENA JURISDICTION, USULUTAN DEPARTMENT. IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT A SOLDIER WAS WOUNDED AND TAKEN TO THE MILITARY HOSPITAL IN THIS CAPITAL. THE SAME MILITARY UNIT REPORTED THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER CLASH THAT RESULTED IN ONE DEAD TERRORIST AND THE SEIZURE OF VARIOUS KINDS OF WAR MATERIEL NEAR SAN RAFAEL FARM IN THE SAME TOWN. IN THE COUNTRY'S EASTERN REGION, MILITARY DETACHMENT NO.4 REPORTED THAT A TERRORIST WAS KILLED AND TWO OTHERS WERE WOUNDED DURING A CLASH IN LA RANERA STREAM, SAN CARLOS, MORAZAN DEPARTMENT. AN M-16 RIFLE, CARTRIDGE CLIPS, AND AMMUNITION WERE SEIZED THERE. MEANWHILE, THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE REPORTED THAT PONCE BATTALION UNITS FOUND THE DECOMPOSED BODY OF A SUBVERSIVE IN LA FINCA HILL, SAN MIGUEL. AN M-16 RIFLE, FIVE GRENADES, AND MATERIAL FOR THE PRODUCTION OF EXPLOSIVES WERE FOUND IN THE SAME PLACE. THE BRIGADE, WHICH IS HEADQUARTERED IN SAN MIGUEL, ADDED THAT THE SEIZURE WAS MADE YESTERDAY MORNING. NATIONAL GUARD UNITS GUARDING THE LAS CANAS BRIDGE, WHICH IS ON THE NORTHERN TRUNK HIGHWAY IN APOPA, THIS MORNING REPELLED A TERRORIST ATTACK THAT RESULTED IN NO CASUALTIES. THE ARMED CLASH INVOLVED MORTAR AND RIFLE FIRE AND LASTED 30 MINUTES. MEMBERS OF THAT SECURITY GROUP ARE COMBING THE AREA TO DETERMINE THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THE FIGHTING.
DEV-MUC3-0002	SAN SALVADOR, 4 JAN 90 -- ACCORDING TO STATEMENTS MADE BY A SALVADORAN OFFICER TODAY, DESPITE THE CHANGE IN THE LEADERSHIP OF THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE, THE AIR FORCE WILL CONTINUE ITS NORMAL ACTIVITIES. THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE MAINTAINS THE SAME OPERATIONAL LEVEL IT HAS HAD FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS, DESPITE THE REMOVAL OF ITS TOP COMMANDER, JAUN RAFAEL BUSTILLOS, THIS WEEK. PARATROOPER BATTALION COMMANDER MAJOR RENE RODRIGUEZ HURTADO SAID TODAY THAT THE AIR FORCE WILL CONTINUE TO OBEY THE ORDERS OF THE GENERAL STAFF AND TO MAINTAIN A SIMILAR OPERATIONAL LEVEL. "WE KNOW GENERAL VILLAMARIONA ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WE WILL CONTINUE WITH OUR BATTALION'S ATTACKS ON ALL THE TERRORIST CRIMINALS' REDOUBTS. WE DEPEND DIRECTLY ON THE GENERAL STAFF, SINCE IT IS THE STRATEGIC HEAD OF THE ENTIRE ARMY. THE GENERAL STAFF GIVES US OUR ORDERS TO LAUNCH OUR OPERATIONS." MAJOR RODRIGUEZ HURTADO TODAY DENIED THAT SALVADORAN AIR FORCE PLANES HAD ENTERED NICARAGUAN TERRITORY AS THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT SAID LAST WEEK. MAJ RODRIGUEZ HURTADO SAID THAT SALVADORAN AIR FORCE PLANES HAVE NEVER ENTERED THE NEIGHBORING TERITORY OF NICARAGUA. "I CAN TELL YOU THAT THOSE WERE NEITHER SALVADORAN NOR HONDURAN PLANES. IN MY OPINION, THE SANDINISTS WANT TO INVENT AN EXCUSE TO CONTINUE HELPING THE FMLN . OURS AND THE HONDURAN PLANES ARE SMALL PLANES. I DO NOT THINK THAT HONDURAN PLANES ENTERED NICARAGUAN TERRITORY. THOSE COMMUNISTS ARE TRYING TO INVENT AN EXCUSE TO CONTINUE HELPING THE FMLN TERRORIST CRIMINALS." MAJ. RODRIGUEZ MADE THESE STATEMENTS DURING THE PRESENTATION OF A NUMBER OF WEAPONS CONFISCATED BY THE PARATROOPERS BATTALION ON 4 JANUARY. "HERE WE HAVE 12 RIFLES, 11 AR-15 RIFLES AND 1 AK-47 RIFLE; 4,000 CARTRIDGES, OF WHICH 2,000 ARE FOR M-16 MACHINE GUNS AND 2,000 FOR AK-47 RIFLES; 36 CARTRIDGES OF AN UNKNOWN CALIBER-- MILITARY INTELLIGENCE HAS ALREADY BEEN INFORMED OF THIS DISCOVERY; AND I RADIO OF THE TYPE USED BY THE LEADERS OF THE TERRORIST GROUPS." THE WEAPONS WERE FOUND AT EL NISPERO CREEK NEAR THE SACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD. AMONG THE CONFISCATED WEAPONS WERE CARTRIDGES OF UNKNOWN MAKE. THIS IS APPPARENTLY THE FIRST TIME THE ARMY HAS FOUND THAT TYPE OF CARTRIDGE. MAJ RODRIGUEZ HURTADO SAID THAT MILITARY INTELLIGENCE WILL PROCEED TO ESTABLISH THE ORIGIN OF THESE CARTRIDGES AND THE WEAPONS FOR WHICH THEY ARE INTENDED.
DEV-MUC3-0003	SANTIAGO, 5 JAN 90 -- THE GOVERNMENT JUNTA YESTERDAY APPROVED A DRAFT BILL TO "MODIFY LAW 18314, WHICH DEFINES TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AND ESTABLISHES PENALTIES." THE BILL WILL RESTRICT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO THE MOST SERIOUS CASES AND WILL LEAVE OTHER CRIMES, THAT WERE FORMERLY CONSIDERED TERRORIST ACTIVITY, FOR TRIAL UNDER COMMON LAW. THE NEW BILL ACCEPTS THE POSSIBILITY IN SOME CASES OF A PRISONER BEING RELEASED ON BAIL OR RECEIVING A PARDON OR AMNESTY. THE BILL ALSO ESTABLISHES OTHER BENEFITS NOT CONTEMPLATED BY LAW 18314, INCLUDING A NEW PROCEEDINGS FOR SPEEDIER TRIALS. ACCORDING TO RETIRED GENERAL FERNANDO TORRES SILVA, WHO IS THE ARMY JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL, THE MODIFICATIONS ESTABLISH LIGHTER SENTENCES, FREEDOM ON BAIL, AND POSSIBLE PARDONS OR AMNESTIES. THESE BENEFITS WERE NOT CONTEMPLATED UNDER THE FORMER ANTITERRORIST LAW. AS AN EXAMPLE TORRES CITED THAT "SENTENCES OF INDIVIDUALS TRIED AS ACCOMPLICES WILL BE LOWER. THEY WILL RECEIVE LOWER SENTENCES THAN THAT PREVIOUSLY CONTEMPLATED." THE NEW BILL WILL ALSO ALLOW A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING TRIED BY THE INTERIOR MINISTRY TO GO OUT ON BAIL. ACCORDING THE GENERAL ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, MORE THAN 1,000 PRISONERS MIGHT BENEFIT FROM THE MODIFICATIONS.
DEV-MUC3-0004	CLANDESTINE, 8 JAN 90 -- GOODBYE GENERAL RAFAEL BUSTILLO, FALSE HOPE FOR MASS KILLERS. GEN. BUSTILLO RESIGNS OR IS MADE TO RESIGN AS THE AIR FORCE CHIEF. BECAUSE OF THIS, THE GENERAL IS ADMITTING THAT WITHOUT THE BOMBING ON SAN SALVADOR'S NEIGHBORHOODS THE FMLN WOULD HAVE DEFEATED THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES. BUSTILLO'S RESIGNATION IS YET ANOTHER SIGN OF THE FAILURE OF 10 YEARS OF THE U.S. COUNTERINSURGENCY POLICY IN EL SALVADOR, AS BECAME CLEAR WITH THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED ON 10 NOVEMBER. FOR 10 YEARS THE MILITARY AND THEIR U.S. SPONSORS BASED THEIR TRUST IN THE AIR POWER TO DROWN IN BLOOD THE ASPIRATION OF THE NATION TO ACHIEVE DEMOCRACY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. THIS FIRST HAPPENED IN THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY, WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF DOZENS OF TOWNS LIKE TENANCINGO, BERLIN, TOROLA, SAN FERNANDO, AND SO MANY OTHERS THAT TOOK PLACE ALONG WITH THE GENOCIDE CARRIED OUT BY THE INFANTRY WITH THE MASS MURDERS OF CIVILIANS IN EL MOSOTO, SUNPUL, AND OCOTAPAYO. BUSTILLO IS LEAVING AS SO MANY GENERALS AND U.S. AMBASSADORS HAVE. AND LIKE ALL OF THEM HIS DEPARTURE REVEALS THE IMPERIALIST POWER'S FAILURE TO CONSOLIDATE ITS COUNTERINSURGENCY PROGRAM IN EL SALVADOR. AS ALL THE OTHERS WHO HAVE LEFT, BUSTILLO ALSO SEEKS EXCUSES IN THE FACE OF HIS FAILURE, BY ACCUSING OTHERS. HE ACCUSES VIDES CASANOVA OF BEING SOFT IN FIGHTING THE PEOPLE'S PLAN. ONE WOULD HAVE TO ASK BUSTILLO IF THE AIR FORCE, OF WHICH HE REPRESENTED ITS MOST ENCOURAGING PILLAR, WAS SOFT WHEN IT MURDERED 70,000 SALVADORANS, MONSIGNOR ARNULFO ROMERO AND THE JESUIT PRIESTS INCLUDED, AND EVEN WHEN IT MURDERED PATRIOT OFFICERS OF THAT SAME ARMY. WAS THE U.S. PENTAGON SOFT WHEN IT GAVE $3 BILLION, WEAPONS, AND BOMBS FOR THE MOST COWARDLY ACT OF GENOCIDE LATIN AMERICA CAN RECALL THIS CENTURY? THE U.S. STRATEGY, IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE TOP MILITARY COMMAND IN THE PAST 10 YEARS WITH ALL ITS MIGHT DID ALL IT COULD SO THAT THE PERMANENT REBELLION IN THE RURAL AREAS REACHED THE COUNTRY'S VITAL CENTERS, AS INDEED HAPPENED AS OF THE 10 NOVEMBER OFFENSIVE. BUSTILLO STATES IT CLEARLY. THE BOMBING TEMPORARILY HALTED THE DEFEAT OF THE TOP COMMAND. THROUGH AN ACT OF GENOCIDE, IT MANAGED TO REMOVE THE DISGRUNTLED PEOPLE FROM THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THE GUERRILLA FORCES WERE. BUSTILLO ACKNOWLEDGES GENOCIDE IS THE SOLE WAY THE ARMED FORCES CAN SURVIVE. BUSTILLO ACKNOWLEDGES THE FMLN'S STRENGTH AND THEREFORE URGES THE ARMED FORCES TO BE TOUGHER AND INFLEXIBLE AND REJECTS A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT. A POLITICAL SOLUTION WOULD EXPRESS THE CONSENSUS AMONG THE COUNTRY'S MAJOR SECTORS. OBVIOUSLY THE TOP COMMAND REPRESENTS A DECADENT MINORITY. BUSTILLO SUPPORTS LAUNCHING A FASCIST CRUSADE AGAINST THE PEOPLE'S WISH FOR DEMOCRACY. IN THIS EFFORT, HE LASHES OUT AT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, ALL OPPOSITION SECTORS THAT REPORT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, AND ALL SECTORS THAT SUPPORT DEMOCRATIZING THE COUNTRY. IN CONCLUSION, WE SAY THAT BUSTILLO IS NOT RESIGNING OF HIS OWN VOLITION. THE FMLN ACTION ELIMINATED BUSTILLO AS IT ELIMINATED GARCIA, VIDES, AND SO MANY OTHER MILITARY CHIEFS WHO LEFT THEIR POSTS WITHOUT FULFILLING THE TASK COMMISSIONED BY THE UNITED STATES: TO STOP THE FMLN. THE FMLN OFFENSIVE BARED THE GENOCIDAL, ANTIPOPULAR, AND FASCIST NATURE OF THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI REGIME TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT PROMPTED A STRONG DEBATE IN THE UNITED STATES ON CUTTING MILITARY AID. THE JESUITS' MURDERS AND THE BOMBINGS SO SHOOK THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT IT IS PRESSURING FOR PUNISHMENT OF THE OFFICERS INVOLVED IN THESE INCIDENTS. HOWEVER, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION ACCEPTED THIS, SINCE COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE AND HIS CLIQUE, EVEN CRISTIANI, MUST SHOULDER THIS RESPONSIBILITY. WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT IN COSTA RICA THE SALVADORAN DEFENSE MINISTER DISCLOSED CRISTIANI AUTHORIZED THE BOMBINGS. BUSH NEEDED A SCAPEGOAT TO PLACE IT ON THE ALTAR OF THE DEBATES WHICH WILL BEGIN IN THE U.S. CONGRESS ON THE FATE OF MILITARY AID. BUSTILLO IS BUSH'S SCAPEGOAT. HOWEVER, BUSTILLO WAS ALREADY A USELESS ELEMENT OF THE MURDEROUS MACHINERY THAT REMAINS ACTIVE. WILL THE U.S. PUBLIC AND CONGRESS BE APPEASED WITH THIS FOUL TASTING CANDY? TIME AND THE SPIRIT OF THE TIMES ARE OBVIOUSLY RUNNING AGAINST THE FASCIST PROGRAM IN EL SALVADOR. WHILE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD TEAR DOWN DOGMAS, DICTATORSHIPS, AND WALLS, BUSTILLO, WHO LEAVES THROUGH THE DOOR OF DEFEAT, ASKS THE ARMED FORCES TO BE TOUGHER, COMMIT MORE GENOCIDE, AND BUILD MORE WALLS OF REPRESSION AGAINST THE CHURCH, THE PEOPLE, AND THE NATION AS A WHOLE. GOODBYE, GEN. BUSTILLO. WE CONTINUE WRITING HISTORY WITHOUT YOU. THE DECADE WE BEGIN IS OF DEMOCRACY, INDEPENDENCE, AND SELF-DETERMINATION. THAT IS WHY FOREIGN INTERVENTION AND THE WALLS OF INTOLERANCE HAVE A SHORT LIFE SPAN IN THIS COUNTRY, WHERE THE PEOPLE GROW IN HEROISM AND THE STRUGGLE FOR SOCIAL CHANGE IS NOT DETERRED BY BOMBINGS.
DEV-MUC3-0005	CLANDESTINE, 8 JAN 90 -- A WAR BULLETIN INDICATES THAT ON 6 JANUARY AT 1625, FMLN TROOPS CLASHED WITH THE CAVALRY COMPANY IN FINCA SANTA ELENA, SANTA TECLA, NEAR SAN SALVADOR, KILLING THREE AND WOUNDING FOUR ENEMY TROOPS, INCLUDING THE PATROL LEADER WHO WAS AMONG THOSE KILLED. OUR TROOPS SEIZED AN M-14 RIFLE FROM THE ENEMY, 3,000 CARTRIDGES FOR A 7.62-MM RIFLE, FIVE KNAPSACKS, SIX GRENADES, AND FIELD EQUIPMENT.
DEV-MUC3-0006	SAN SALVADOR, 9 JAN 90 -- THE SALVADORAN ARMY TODAY PREVENTED THE OCCUPATION OF CITIES IN THE EASTERN PART OF EL SALVADOR, WAGING STRONG CLASHES BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND DAWN, ACCORDING TO REPORTS BY MILITARY SOURCES. THE ATTACKS, ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS, TOOK PLACE IN USULUTAN, USULUTAN DEPARTMENT, 110 KM EAST OF THE CAPITAL, AND IN SANTA ELENA WHERE AS OF 0700 CLASHES WERE STILL UNDER WAY. SANTA ELENA IS LOCATED 119 KM EAST OF THE CAPITAL, AND BOTH CITIES ARE COFFEE REGIONS. IN USULUTAN, 6TH BRIGADE TROOPS AND RAPID DEPLOYMENT BATTALIONS REPELLED THE INCURSION WITH ARTILLERY FIRE. DURING THE 2D WEEK OF DECEMBER, THERE HAD BEEN STRONG CLASHES ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF USULUTAN, IN WHAT THE GUERRILLAS CALLED THE "BATTLE OF EL NISPERAL," IN THE CANTON THAT BEARS THE SAME NAME, WHICH COST THE ARMY 29 DEAD, ALTHOUGH IT HAS ONLY ADMITTED TO 21 DEATHS. IN SANTA ELENA THE CLASHES WERE ALSO STRONG, BUT SO FAR THERE HAVE BEEN NO REPORTS OF CASUALTIES ON EITHER SIDE. FROM SAN VICENTE, IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY, WHERE THE CHICHONTEPEC VOLCANO IS LOCATED, STRONG CLASHES WERE REPORTED, AND THE 5TH BRIGADE BOMBED REBEL POSITIONS ON THE COLCANO, WHERE THE FMLN HAS STRONG BASTIONS. THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE IS CARRYING OUT OPERATIONS IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR. AND ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CAPITAL THIS MORNING POWERFUL EXPLOSIONS, CHARACTERIZED AS MILITARY ACTIONS TO PREVENT REBELS FROM GATHERING, COULD BE HEARD. THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST, THERE WERE ATTEMPTS TO ENTER THE CAPITAL FROM THAT DIRECTION. THE ARMY HAS INCREASED ITS SURVEILLANCE TO PREVENT MOBILIZATIONS, AND THROUGH CAREFUL SEARCHES VEHICLES ARE BEING CONTROLLED AT THE CAPITAL CITY'S ENTRANCES AND EXITS. IN OTHER ACTIONS, THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE REPORTED AT LEAST SIX FMLN DEATHS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. LAST NIGHT THERE WERE FEWER ATTACKS ON STORES AND ELECTRIC TOWERS IN THE CAPITAL. THERE WERE ALSO THREATS OF POWER RATIONING IF THESE ACTIONS CONTINUED.
DEV-MUC3-0007	SANTIAGO, 9 JAN 90 -- THE DEPLOYMENT OF U.S. SHIPS, INCLUDING THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER "JOHN F. KENNEDY" AND THE CORVETTE "VIRGINIA" ALONG THE COLOMBIAN COAST YESTERDAY, SEEKING TO INTERCEPT DRUG TRAFFICKING ROUTES, COULD BE THE RESULT OF THREE POLICIES: FIRST, THAT THE UNITED STATES NEEDS TO JUSTIFY THE INVASION OF PANAMA UNDER THE EXCUSE OF ITS FIGHT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING. SECOND, THAT BOTH THE DEPLOYMENT OF SHIPS AND THE INVASION OF PANAMA ARE PART OF A SERIOUS MILITARY PLAN TO END THE DRUG PLAGUE. THIRD, THAT THE UNITED STATES MUST SOMEHOW JUSTIFY THE INVASION OF PANAMA AND THE NEED TO RECOVER ITS INTERNATIONAL IMAGE HAS PROVIDED A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO PUT AN END TO DRUG TRAFFICKING. IF THE OBJECTIVE REALLY IS TO ELIMINATE DRUGS, THEN THE BATTLE IS PRAISEWORTHY, BUT--LIKE IN PANAMA--THE PROCEDURE IS PAINFUL, OVERBEARING, IMPERIALISTIC, AND HUMILIATING. INSTEAD OF WINNING THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES' APPRECIATION AND SOLIDARITY WITH THIS LAUDABLE CAUSE, THE UNITED STATES IS AGAIN PROVOKING ANGRY REACTIONS AND DEEP DISTRUST. THE SIDE EFFECTS OF THIS ACTION COULD BE VERY NEGATIVE FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, IN WHICH ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THIS CONTINENT SHOULD BE COOPERATING. ALTERNATIVELY, WOULD IT BE BETTER IF THEY DID NOT COOPERATE IN THIS PHASE? COULD IT BE THAT WHAT WE HAVE CALLED IMPERIALISTIC CLUMSINESS, INSENSIBILITY, AND ABUSE, IS SIMPLY A DELIBERATE STRATEGY WITH WHICH, PERHAPS FOR WELL FOUNDED REASONS AND EVEN AT THE RISK OF DIPLOMATIC CONFLICTS, THE UNITED STATES SEEKS TO ISOLATE LATIN AMERICA ON PURPOSE AND THUS ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF ITS OPERATION? IF THIS WERE THE CASE THEN WE MUST ASK, WHY? FROM ITS OPERATIONS IN PANAMA AND COLOMBIA, THE UNITED STATES IS TELLING US THAT IT IS NOT CONCERNED WITH THE DIPLOMATIC ASPECT FOR THE TIME BEING. THE UNITED STATES WANTS ACTION AND EFFICIENCY. THE UNITED STATES IS LOSING ITS PATIENCE, AND PERHAPS ITS CONFIDENCE IN THE SERIOUSNESS AND CAPABILITY OF LATIN AMERICA TO FACE THIS WAR. IF THE ACTION IN COLOMBIA GOES FURTHER THAN A MERE SURVEILLANCE, THE UNITED STATES WILL BE ESTABLISHING A PRECEDENT IN THIS BATTLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING. THIS MEANS THAT DURING A FIRST PHASE THE UNITED STATES WILL CARRY OUT A MILITARY OPERATION BY ITSELF. DURING A SECOND PHASE IT WILL DISCUSS SECONDARY SUBJECTS BUT WITH LESS URGENCY IN THE WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING. NEXT 15 FEBRUARY, BUSH WILL MEET IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS, COLOMBIA, WITH HIS COLOMBIAN, PERUVIAN, AND BOLIVIAN COUNTERPARTS. PERHAPS ON THAT OCCASION THEY WILL TALK ABOUT THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THIS WAR: THE REORGANIZATION OF THE LOCAL ECONOMIES TO END THE DEPENDENCY ON COCA PLANTATIONS, THE RECOVERY OF DRUG ADDICTS, AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF GOVERNMENTS, ETC. DURING THIS CURRENT PHASE, HOWEVER, THE UNITED STATES WISHES TO ACT ALONE. WHO KNOWS IF IT IS BECAUSE OF LATIN AMERICA'S LACK OF UNDERSTANDING? AS WE SAID A FEW DAYS AGO, THE DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM IS CREATING NEW SITUATIONS IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. THE U.S. PROPOSAL IS PROBABLY SOMETHING LIKE: COULD A WORLD POWER LIKE THE UNITED STATES CONTINUE TO IGNORE A SERIOUS PROBLEM LIKE THE PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, AND CONSUMPTION OF DRUGS, MERELY TO AVOID HARMING LATIN AMERICAN SENSIBILITIES, SENSIBILITIES OF COUNTRIES WHOSE GOVERNMENTS ARE ALWAYS MUDDLED UP IN USELESS DIPLOMATIC AND BUREAUCRATIC PROCEDURES AND FRUITLESS NEGOTIATIONS? AND ALL THIS WHILE A LARGE PART OF THE DEVELOPED WORLD'S POPULATION IS BECOMING ADDICTED TO A DEADLY PRODUCT? THE UNITED STATES COULD ALSO BE ASKING ITSELF: HAVE THE LATIN AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS BEEN ABLE TO SOLVE THIS SERIOUS PROBLEM BY THEMSELVES? CAN THOSE GOVERNMENTS STOP DRUG TRAFFICKING WHEN IT IS KNOWN THAT DRUGS AND CORRUPTION GO HAND IN HAND; WHEN IN THE PAST AND PERHAPS IN THE PRESENT, HIGH RANKING GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN LINKED WITH THIS ILLEGAL TRADE AND PROTECTING THE MEDELLIN CARTEL CHIEFS? WHY, FOR EXAMPLE, AFTER ALL THIS HASN'T THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT MANAGED TO EXTRADITE THE MAIN CHIEFS OF THAT CARTEL TO THE UNITED STATES? LET US RECALL THE HORRIBLE EXPLOSION OF THE COLOMBIAN AIRLINER, IN WHICH MORE THAN 100 PEOPLE DIED; THE BOMB EXPLOSION IN THE SECRET POLICE HEADQUARTERS IN BOGOTA; THE MURDER OF MANY JOURNALISTS WHO WERE ENGAGED IN AN HEROIC WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING; AND MAINLY, LET US RECALL THE EVER-PRESENT DIFFICULTIES THAT MUST BE FACED WHEN THE MEDELLIN CARTEL CHIEFS MUST BE PUNISHED AND EXTRADITED.
DEV-MUC3-0008	BOGOTA, 9 JAN 90 -- RICARDO ALFONSO CASTELLAR, MAYOR OF ACHI, IN THE NORTHERN DEPARTMENT OF BOLIVAR, WHO WAS KIDNAPPED ON 5 JANUARY, APPARENTLY BY ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION GUERRILLAS, WAS FOUND DEAD TODAY, ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES. CASTELLAR WAS KIDNAPPED ON 5 JANUARY ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF ACHI, ABOUT 850 KM NORTH OF BOGOTA, BY A GROUP OF ARMED MEN, WHO FORCED HIM TO ACCOMPANY THEM TO AN UNDISCLOSED LOCATION. POLICE SOURCES IN CARTAGENA REPORTED THAT CASTELLAR'S BODY SHOWED SIGNS OF TORTURE AND SEVERAL BULLET WOUNDS. CASTELLAR WAS KIDNAPPED BY ELN GUERRILLAS WHILE HE WAS TRAVELING IN A BOAT DOWN THE CAUCA RIVER TO THE TENCHE AREA, A REGION WITHIN HIS JURISDICTION. IN CARTAGENA IT WAS REPORTED THAT CASTELLAR FACED A "REVOLUTIONARY TRIAL" BY THE ELN AND THAT HE WAS FOUND GUILTY AND EXECUTED. CASTELLAR IS THE SECOND MAYOR THAT HAS BEEN MURDERED IN COLOMBIA IN THE LAST 3 DAYS. ON 5 JANUARY, CARLOS JULIO TORRADO, MAYOR OF ABREGO IN THE NORTHEASTERN DEPARTMENT OF SANTANDER, WAS KILLED APPARENTLY BY ANOTHER GUERILLA COLUMN, ALSO BELONGING TO THE ELN. TORRADO'S SON, WILLIAM; GUSTAVO JACOME QUINTERO, THE DEPARTMENTAL GOVERNMENT SECRETARY; AND BODYGUARD JAIRO ORTEGA, WERE ALSO KILLED. THE GROUP WAS TRAVELING IN A 4-WHEEL DRIVE VEHICLE BETWEEN CUCUTA AND THE RURAL AREA KNOWN AS CAMPANARIO WHEN THEIR VEHICLE WAS BLOWN UP BY FOUR EXPLOSIVE CHARGES THAT DETONATED ON THE HIGHWAY.
DEV-MUC3-0009	MEDELLIN, 9 JAN 90 -- THE NATIONAL ARMY WAS INVOLVED IN NEW CLASHES WITHIN THE PAST FEW HOURS WITH FARC AND THE ELN IN THE RURAL AREA OF YONDO IN ANTIOQUIA'S MIDDLE MAGDALENA REGION. SPOKESMEN FOR THE 5TH BRIGADE REPORTED 5 SOLDIERS KILLED, SEVERAL WOUNDED, AND AT LEAST 12 REBEL CASUALTIES. THE EXODUS OF PEASANTS FROM THAT REGION CONTINUED TO INCREASE TODAY ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL REPORTS. THE PEASANTS WALKED AWAY FROM THEIR PROPERTIES TO AVOID BECOMING VICTIMS OF THE CLASHES.
DEV-MUC3-0010	LIMA, 9 JAN 90 -- PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA HAS CONFIRMED THAT THE U.S. TROOPS THAT SURROUNDED OUR DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN PANAMA WERE WITHDRAWN AFTER A FORMER MINISTER SURNAMED CORDOVA LEFT THE EMBASSY. THE MILITARY MAN, WHO IS INVOLVED IN A MURDER TRIAL, LEFT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY AS SOON AS HE LEARNED THAT THE EMBASSY CONSIDERED HIM PERSONA NON GRATA. I THINK JOURNALISTS HAVE MAGNIFIED THE ISSUE A BIT. AS FAR AS WE KNOW, PEOPLE SOUGHT PROTECTION.... SOMEONE ARRIVES AT THE DOOR OF THE EMBASSY AND ASKS FOR REFUGE IN VIEW OF A SITUATION OF FORCE. THE SITUATION IN PANAMA IS ABNORMAL; IT HAS BEEN TOTALLY INVADED BY 30,000 SOLDIERS. SOME PERSONS ENTERED THE EMBASSY. AT LEAST ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN ALLEGEDLY LINKED WITH THE DEATH OF A PANAMANIAN MINISTER, A MR SPADAFORA, WHO WAS MURDERED. THE AUTHORITIES OF THE EMBASSY AND OF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY STATED THAT THIS PERSON'S PRESENCE WAS UNDESIRABLE. WE DO NOT REFUSE TO GRANT REFUGE--A CONDITION THAT IS GRANTED BEFORE GRANTING POLITICAL ASYLUM--TO WHOMEVER FEELS HARASSED OR MISTREATED. IN A CASE LIKE THIS, HOWEVER, IN WHICH THERE WAS AN ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN A MURDER WHICH WAS COMMITTED YEARS AGO, THIS PERSON--I BELIEVE HE IS A MAN SURNAMED CORDOVA, APPARENTLY A HIGHRANKING PANAMANIAN GUARD OFFICER--WAS TOLD THAT HIS PRESENCE WAS NOT WANTED. HE LEFT THE EMBASSY OF HIS OWN WILL. THERE ARE OTHER PANAMANIAN DEFENSE FORCES OFFICERS AT THE EMBASSY, INCLUDING MR NORIEGA'S SECRETARY, BUT THEIR STATUS SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED BY PERU. AN INCIDENT WAS REPORTED YESTERDAY, AS THE U.S. TROOPS SURROUNDED THE EMBASSY, DEPLOYING BARRIERS AND BARBED WIRE. THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO DEPICT A DRAMATIC AND SPECTACULAR PICTURE OF A SIEGE OR PERHAPS OF AN INVASION OF THE EMBASSY. FORTUNATELY, THE FOREIGN MINISTRY RESORTED TO DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS AND THE TROOPS WERE SOON WITHDRAWN.
DEV-MUC3-0011	LIMA, 9 JAN 90 -- AUTHORITIES HAVE REPORTED THAT FORMER PERUVIAN DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL ENRIQUE LOPEZ ALBUJAR DIED TODAY IN LIMA AS A CONSEQUENCE OF A TERRORIST ATTACK. LOPEZ ALBUJAR, FORMER ARMY COMMANDER GENERAL AND DEFENSE MINISTER UNTIL MAY 1989, WAS RIDDLED WITH BULLETS BY THREE YOUNG INDIVIDUALS AS HE WAS GETTING OUT OF HIS CAR IN AN OPEN PARKING LOT IN A COMMERCIAL CENTER IN THE RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD OF SAN ISIDRO. LOPEZ ALBUJAR, 63, WAS DRIVING HIS OWN CAR WITHOUT AN ESCORT. HE WAS SHOT EIGHT TIMES IN THE CHEST. THE FORMER MINISTER WAS RUSHED TO THE AIR FORCE HOSPITAL WHERE HE DIED.
DEV-MUC3-0012	LIMA, 9 JAN 90 -- HERE IS AN OFFICIAL DEFENSE MINISTRY COMMUNIQUE: 1. AT 0945 THIS MORNING, A GROUP OF SUBVERSIVES CONDUCTED AN ARMED TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER DIVISON GENERAL ENRIQUE LOPEZ ALBUJAR, RETIRED. 2. THE VICTIM WAS TAKEN TO THE AIR FORCE HOSPITAL WHERE HE UNFORTUNATELY PASSED AWAY. 3. THE AUTHORITIES ARE INVESTIGATING THE ATTACK, AND THEY ARE CONDUCTING THE APPROPRIATE OPERATIONS TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS. LIMA, 9 JANUARY 1990. DEFENSE MINISTRY COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE.
DEV-MUC3-0013	SAN SALVADOR, 9 JAN 90 -- THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS EXPRESSED SATISFACTION WITH THE INVESTIGATIONS IN THE CASE OF THE MURDERED JESUITS AND IS ENCOURAGING THE GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR THE PERPETRATORS OF THIS CRIME. MONSIGNOR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ TODAY STATED THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS PLEASED WITH THE PROGRESS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS REGARDING THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS. HE SAID THAT IF THE SOLDIERS INVOLVED IN THE KILLING ARE PUNISHED, THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ONLY EARN INTERNATIONAL PRESTIGE, BUT WILL LAY THE GROUNDWORK TO CONSOLIDATE THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN EL SALVADOR. ROSA CHAVEZ SAID THAT IF THE KILLING IS SOLVED, THE PERIOD OF IMPUNITY THAT HAS TARNISHED THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND COVERED UP A NUMBER OF CRIMES TO WHICH JUSTICE HAS NOT BEEN APPLIED WILL END. IT SEEMS THAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED FOR HAVING HAD THE COURAGE TO KEEP HIS PROMISE TO CONDUCT A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION. WE UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAS NOT YET REVEALED THE DETAILS OF THIS CRIME BUT THAT HE WILL DO SO SOON. HOWEVER, I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT BEEN SAID: THE CHURCH IS NOT INTERESTED IN LEARNING WHO THE MURDERERS ARE JUST FOR THE TRUTH TO COME OUT. THE CHURCH WANTS THIS PUNISHMENT TO MEAN THAT IMPUNITY HAS ENDED IN EL SALVADOR; THAT THE POOR WILL FEEL CERTAIN THAT JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL FOR THEM; THAT SO MANY CRIMES THAT HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN WILL BE SOLVED LITTLE BY LITTLE; BUT MAINLY, THAT FROM NOW ON, CRIMES WILL NO LONGER GO UNSOLVED. MSGR ROSA CHAVEZ ADDED THAT THE TONE OF VERBAL VIOLENCE MUST BE LOWERED SINCE THIS ONLY RESULTS IN A USELESS CONFRONTATION AND PROMOTES A POLARIZATION OF THE CONFLICT, AS WELL AS HINDERS ANY EFFORT TO APPLY JUSTICE. HE SAID THAT THE VERBAL WAR IS AS HARMFUL AS IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE. HE SAID THAT IRRESPONSIBLE CHARGES AND ACCUSATIONS CONTINUE IN THE COUNTRY, AND THEY DO NOT HELP STRENGTHEN THE PEACE PROCESS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO OVERCOME VERBAL VIOLENCE. THIS MEANS THAT A CALM CLIMATE, A CLIMATE THAT IS AS IMPARTIAL AS POSSIBLE, MUST BE SOUGHT TO DISCUSS ISSUES. WE RECALL THAT LAST YEAR, MANY VIOLENT STATEMENTS WERE MADE. MANY HARSH EXPRESSIONS WERE UTTERED. TOO MANY HEATED STATEMENTS PRINTED IN SOME NEWSPAPERS. THE LANGUAGE USED IS TOO HARSH. I THINK THAT TO OBTAIN JUSTICE, WE NEED A CALMER CLIMATE. HE ADDED THAT A CLIMATE OF SERENITY AND RESPECT WOULD FACILITATE THE RIGHT CONDITIONS FOR A DIALOGUE THAT WOULD GUARANTEE MECHANISMS TO RECONCILE OUR SOCIETY. HE URGED THE GOVERNMENT AND THE JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES TO CONTINUE MAKING PROGRESS IN THE REVIEW OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO REORGANIZE IT IN A WAY THAT WILL ALLOW THE HONEST ADMINSTRATION OF JUSTICE TO DO AWAY WITH IMPUNITY.
DEV-MUC3-0014	SAN SALVADOR, 10 JAN 90 -- A GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN HAS ANNOUNCED THAT WITHIN THE NEXT 72 HOURS THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WILL DISCLOSE THE NAMES OF THE INDIVIDUALS IMPLICATED IN THE MURDER OF SIX JESUITS, IF THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOT "HINDERED." IN A BRIEF STATEMENT TO THE PRESS, MAURICIO SANDOVAL SAID THAT SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI WILL, WITHIN THE PERIOD STATED, ANNOUNCE "THE NAMES OF THE INDIVIDUALS" WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE MULTIPLE CRIME PERPETRATED ON 16 NOVEMBER AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY IN SAN SALVADOR. CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED ON SUNDAY THAT "MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES" PARTICIPATED IN THE CRIME, AND THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WILL BRING THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO JUSTICE IN EL SALVADOR, "REGARDLESS OF WHOM THEY MAY BE." SANDOVAL POINTED OUT THAT "MORE THAN SEVEN PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN THE MURDER, AND TWO PERPETRATED IT." HE ADDED THAT TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS ACTED, ONE THAT MURDERED THE CLERGYMEN AND ANOTHER THAT MURDERED TWO MAIDS, ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY RESULTS ISSUED BY THE CRIME COMMISSION IN CHARGE OF SOLVING THE CASE. "THERE WAS NO TORTURE OR MISTREATMENT, BUT WORDS WERE EXCHANGED" BETWEEN THE MURDERERS AND VICTIMS, THE SPOKESMAN SAID, ADDING THAT FIVE OF THE MURDERED JESUITS HAD RECEIVED "FINISHING SHOTS," ACCORDING TO AUTOPSIES CARRIED OUT BY SALVADORAN FORENSIC DOCTORS. ACCORDING TO TESTIMONY THE COMMISSION GATHERED FROM 115 MEMBERS OF THE ARMY AND 103 CIVILIANS, THE MURDER TOOK PLACE BETWEEN 0200 AND 0300, AND THERE WERE "EXPLOSIONS, MACHINE-GUN BLASTS, AND SHOTS," SANDOVAL SAID. THE SPOKESMAN ADDED THAT 2 OFFICERS AND 45 SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN "CONFINED IN VARIOUS HEADQUARTERS PENDING INVESTIGATION." AT LEAST 230 CARTRIDGES OF VARIOUS CALIBER, INCLUDING SOME FOR SOVIET MADE AK-47'S, M-79 ANTITANK WEAPONS, AND M-67 GRENADES, WERE FOUND AT THE SITE OF THE MURDER, THE OFFICIAL SAID.
DEV-MUC3-0015	CLANDESTINE, 10 JAN 90 -- ON 10 JANUARY AT 1030, ON THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF RADIO VENCEREMOS, AN FMLN UNIT COMMEMORATED THIS OCCASION BY AMBUSHING A MILITARY VEHICLE TRANSPORTING NATIONAL GUARDSMEN FROM SESORI TO SAN MIGUEL. THE AMBUSH TOOK PLACE AT EL BOTIJON, IN SAN SEBASTIAN CANTON, SESORI, AND WAS CARRIED OUT USING EXPLOSIVES. A FEW MINUTES AFTER THE FIGHTING BEGAN OUR TROOPS GAINED CONTROL OF THE SITUATION. ATTENTION, YOUR ATTENTION: THE MILITARY VEHICLE WAS DESTROYED DURING THE AMBUSH AND FIVE NATIONAL GUARD SOLDIERS WERE KILLED, INCLUDING A SERGEANT WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS. DURING THIS SUCCESSFUL AMBUSH IN SESORI, WE SEIZED FROM THE ENEMY--THE REPRESSIVE NATIONAL GUARD--THREE G3-A3 RIFLES, THREE SETS OF MILITARY, OVER 1,000 BULLETS FOR G3-A3 RIFLES, BOOTS, VESTS, AND OTHER MILITARY MATERIEL. TWO G3-A3 RIFLES AND A PRC-77 MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS RADIO WERE DESTROYED AT THE SITE OF THE AMBUSH. OUR PEOPLE WITHDREW WITH NO PROBLEMS.
DEV-MUC3-0016	BUENOS AIRES, 10 JAN 90 -- A UCR BUENOS AIRES PROVINCE COMMITTEE SPOKESMAN TODAY REPORTED THAT A UCR DISTRICT HEADQUARTERS IN BUENOS AIRES PROVINCE WAS "COMPLETELY DESTROYED BY A BOMB EXPLOSION." THE DESTROYED UCR HEADQUARTERS IS IN THE MORENO DISTRICT OF BUENOS AIRES. THE SPOKESMAN ADDED THAT NO ONE WAS INJURED AND THAT LEOPOLDO MOREAU, THE UCR BUENOS AIRES PROVINCE LEADER, HAS TRAVELLED TO MORENO. IT IS EXPECTED THAT UCR BUENOS AIRES PROVINCE BOARD WILL MEET AND THAT THEY WILL ASK THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT AND THE INTERIOR MINISTRY TO INVESTIGATE THE INCIDENT.
DEV-MUC3-0017	SANTIAGO, 10 JAN 90 -- POLICE ARE CARRYING OUT INTENSIVE OPERATIONS IN THE TOWN OF MOLINA IN THE SEVENTH REGION IN SEARCH OF A GANG OF ALLEGED EXTREMISTS WHO COULD BE LINKED TO A RECENTLY DISCOVERED ARSENAL. IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT CARABINEROS IN MOLINA RAIDED THE HOUSE OF 25-YEAR-OLD WORKER MARIO MUNOZ PARDO, WHERE THEY FOUND A FAL RIFLE, AMMUNITION CLIPS FOR VARIOUS WEAPONS, DETONATORS, AND MATERIAL FOR MAKING EXPLOSIVES. IT SHOULD BE RECALLED THAT A GROUP OF ARMED INDIVIDUALS WEARING SKI MASKS ROBBED A BUSINESSMAN ON A RURAL ROAD NEAR MOLINA ON 7 JANUARY. THE BUSINESSMAN, ENRIQUE ORMAZABAL ORMAZABAL, TRIED TO RESIST; THE MEN SHOT HIM AND LEFT HIM SERIOUSLY WOUNDED. HE WAS LATER HOSPITALIZED IN CURICO. CARABINEROS CARRIED OUT SEVERAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE RAID ON MUNOZ' HOME. THE POLICE ARE CONTINUING TO PATROL THE AREA IN SEARCH OF THE ALLEGED TERRORIST COMMAND.
DEV-MUC3-0018	SAN SALVADOR, 10 JAN 90 -- OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT SEVERAL GUERRILLA ATTACKS AND HEAVY FIGHTING TOOK PLACE THE EVENING OF 9 JANUARY AND THIS MORNING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, AND AS A RESULT, THREE SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AND THREE OTHERS INJURED. ALLEGED GUERRILLA URBAN COMMANDOS LAUNCHED TWO HIGHPOWER BOMBS AGAINST A CAR DEALERSHIP IN DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR THIS MORNING. A POLICE REPORT SAID THAT THE ATTACK SET THE BUILDING ON FIRE, BUT DID NOT RESULT IN ANY CASUALTIES ALTHOUGH ECONOMIC LOSSES ARE HEAVY. DURING THE EVENING OF 9 JANUARY, GUERRILLA URBAN COMMANDOS BOMBED TWO ELECTRICITY FACILITIES IN DIFFERENT PLACES IN SAN SALVADOR, WHICH CAUSED POWER OUTAGES IN SOME AREAS OF THE CAPITAL. MEANWHILE, THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE REPORTED TODAY THAT THREE ARMY SOLDIERS WERE KILLED RECENTLY IN CLASHES AGAINST MEMBERS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY. THE WAR BULLETIN BY COPREFA STATED THAT THE CLASHES, IN WHICH THREE MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL JUAN RAMON BELLOSO BATTALION WERE INJURED, TOOK PLACE IN SAN JOSE GUAYABAL, IN THE CENTRAL CUSCATLAN DEPARTMENT, AND IN SANTA ELENA IN THE EASTERN USULUTAN DEPARTMENT.
DEV-MUC3-0019	GUATEMALA CITY, 10 JAN 89 -- GARY ELLIOT KENT JR, A U.S. CITIZEN BEING HELD IN PRISON WHILE AWAITING TRIAL ON DRUG-TRAFFICKING CHARGES, HAS BEEN STABBED TO DEATH IN THE PAVON PRISON CAMP, 18 KM SOUTHEAST OF THIS CAPITAL. KENT JR, AND ANOTHER PERSON WHOSE NAME AND NATIONALITY THE POLICE HAVE NOT REVEALED, WERE ARRESTED IN JULY 1989 ALONG THE SOUTHERN COAST OF GUATEMALA WHEN THE LIGHT PLANE IN WHICH THE TWO WERE TRAVELING HAD TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY LANDING. ACCORDING TO THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT FOLLOWED, THE PLANE WAS TRANSPORTING COCAINE FROM COLOMBIA TO THE UNITED STATES. OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT KENT JR WAS UNEXPECTEDLY ATTACKED BY THREE OTHER PAVON PRISON INMATES WIELDING KNIVES. PRISON GUARDS CAPTURED THE ATTACKERS BUT DID NOT REPORT THEIR NAMES. PRISON SYSTEM DIRECTOR LEONEL FRANCO STATED TODAY THAT THE AMERICAN HAD NOT BEEN SENTENCED AND THAT HIS CASE WAS BEING PROCESSED BY A COURT OF JUSTICE. ON 28 SEPTEMBER, THE U.S. EMBASSY IN GUATEMALA HAD REQUESTED THE EXTRADITION OF KENT JR FOR HIS INVOLVEMENT IN DRUG-TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES AND BECAUSE OF HIS POSSIBLE LINKS WITH THE MEDELLIN CARTEL.
DEV-MUC3-0020	CLANDESTINE, 11 JAN 90 -- REGARDING THE JESUITS' CASE, THE FMLN STATES THAT: 1. THE FMLN AND SEVERAL SECTORS, INCLUDING YOUNG ARMED FORCES OFFICERS, WERE RIGHT IN POINTING TO THE ARMY AS BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS HORRIBLE CRIME. THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ARMED INSTITUTION FOR THIS CASE AND THE CASES INVOLVING FENASTRAS , MONSIGNOR ROMERO, THE NUNS, AND THE U.S. AGRARIAN EXPERTS, AS WELL AS FOR THE BOMBINGS IN THE CITIES AND MASSACRES IN THE RURAL SECTOR, SHOW THAT WE WERE RIGHT WHEN WE MENTIONED IN OUR LAST PEACE PROPOSAL THE NEED TO CLEAN UP THE ARMY AND REFORM THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. 2. TO ADVANCE IN THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIZATION, IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SOLVE THIS CASE. THE OTHER CASES NEED TO BE SOLVED AND THOSE GUILTY FOR THEM SHOULD BE PUNISHED. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RESPONSIBILITIES CANNOT REMAIN AT THE LEVEL OF OFFICERS AND TROOPS WHO ONLY CARRIED OUT ORDERS. MOST IMPORTANT IS TO ESTABLISH RESPONSIBILITY AMONG HIGHER-RANKING OFFICERS BECAUSE A DECISION OF THIS SORT COULD NOT BE BEYOND THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE TOP COMMAND. 3. IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENTS CONCERNING DEMOCRATIZATION; REFORMING THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM; LIFTING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY; REESTABLISHING FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, MOBILIZATION, AND ORGANIZATION; RELEASING THE MORE THAN 3,000 POLITICAL PRISONERS; AND STOPPING THE REPRESSION AGAINST THE CHURCH AND OTHER SECTORS. 4. THE ANNOUNCEMENT BY CRISTIANI IS AN EFFORT TO RESOLVE COMPLICATED DISCUSSIONS ON U.S. AID FOR EL SALVADOR AND TO CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM THIS AID TO MAINTAIN THE WAR. IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO INCREASE AID TO THE SALVADORAN ARMY BECAUSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT OR BECAUSE THE CASE MAY BE RESOLVED. SUCH AID WOULD LEAVE OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF SEEING A CASE LIKE THAT OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS HAPPENING AGAIN. THE BEST WAY TO CONTRIBUTE TO A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION IS TO CEASE AID. WE APPEAL TO THE U.S. CONGRESS TO MAKE THIS DECISION. IF THIS IS DONE, THE FMLN WOULD COMMIT ITSELF TO MAKING EFFORTS TO REACH AN IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. 5. FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR NEGOTIATIONS DEPEND ON JUSTICE-MAKING PROGRESS. IF THE ARMY IS THOROUGHLY PURGED BECAUSE OF THIS CASE, PEACE COULD BE REACHED EARLIER. 6. TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD A PROMPT PEACE, WE WILL ASK THE OFFICE OF THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL TO MEDIATE. WE URGE THE GOVERNMENT TO JOINTLY MEET WITH US AND WITH MR JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR WITHIN THE NEXT 30 DAYS TO RENEW THE DIALOGUE-NEGOTIATION PROCESS. 7. THE FMLN WILL BE WATCHING HOW THE SITUATION DEVELOPS. IT URGES NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL FORCES TO EXERT PRESSURE SO THAT THE INVESTIGATION PROCESS DOES NOT END WITH A DECLARATION OF INTENTION OR WITH STATEMENTS BLAMING LOW-RANKING SOLDIERS TO PROTECT THOSE WHO ARE MOST RESPONSIBLE. THIS WOULD PUSH AWAY THE POSSIBILTIY OF A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT. FMLN GENERAL COMMAND: COMMANDERS SALVADOR SANCHEZ, SHAFICK JORGE HANDAL, EDUARDO SANCHO, JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, AND FRANCISCO JOVEL.
DEV-MUC3-0021	BOGOTA, 11 JAN 90 -- ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY INTELLIGENCE SERVICES, THE FARC LAUNCHED A NEW OFFENSIVE TO RECOVER THE REGION OF MIDDLE MAGDALENA THAT WAS LOST TO GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND HIS MEN 5 YEARS AGO. THIS IS THE REASON FOR FIERCE FIGHTING THERE BETWEEN THE ARMY AND SEVERAL FARC FRONTS DURING THE FIRST FEW DAYS OF THIS YEAR. HEAVILY ARMED AND STRENGTHENED THESE FRONTS ARE TRYING TO MILITARILY TAKE OVER AREAS THAT RODRIGUEZ GACHA'S DEPUTIES HAVE BEEN VACATING BECAUSE OF THE CRISIS CREATED IN THEIR ORGANIZATION BY THE DEATH OF EL MEJICANO . THE AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THAT THE RETURN TO THE STRATEGY OF USING KIDNAPPINGS AS A MEANS TO FINANCE ITSELF IS ALSO PART OF THIS NEW OFFENSIVE THAT SEEMS TO BE ENJOYING THE SUPPORT OF OTHER GUERRILLA GROUPS SUCH AS THE EPL . MEANWHILE, IN LA URIBE THE FARC GENERAL SECRETARIAT HAS SUBMITTED ANOTHER PEACE PROPOSAL TO PRESIDENT BARCO. THE GUERRILLA GROUP STATES THAT IT IS WILLING TO ESTABLISH A NEW POLITICAL PARTY CALLED BOLIVARIAN REUNION OF THE PEOPLE IF THE GOVERNMENT CALLS A PLESBICITE TO ESTABLISH A NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY. THE PROPOSAL WAS RECEIVED ON 9 JANUARY DIRECTLY FROM THE HANDS OF FARC LEADERS BY MEMBERS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ADVISORY BOARD FOR PEACE ISSUES. THE GOVERNMENT MUST ASSESS THE PROPOSAL IT HAS RECEIVED, AS WELL AS FARC'S SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES, TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT SHOULD RESUME TALKS WITH THIS ORGANIZATION. FOR THE TIME BEING, MEMBERS OF THE ADVISORY BOARD WILL TRAVEL TO SANTO DOMINGO THIS WEEKEND TO CONTINUE STUDYING WITH THE M-19 THE POSSIBILITIES OF INCORPORATING IT INTO POLITICAL LIFE FOLLOWING THE COLLAPSE OF THE SPECIAL PEACE DISTRICT ISSUE IN CONGRESS.
DEV-MUC3-0022	ROME , 11 JAN 90 -- THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT HAS DESCRIBED THE ARREST OF FIVE SOLDIERS ACCUSED OF COMMITTING THE MASSACRE AS "A MANIPULATED COVER OPERATION." BASICALLY, CRISTIANI IS ALLEGED TO HAVE DECIDED TO PUNISH A NUMBER OF LOW-RANKING OFFICERS TO CLOSE THE CASE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND TO END INTERNATIONAL PRESSURES. WHAT IS YOUR OPINION IN THIS REGARD? THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ACKNOWLEDGES THAT MEMBERS OF THE ARMY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MASSACRE IS A FIRST STEP AND DEFINITELY A GOOD THING, BUT IT IS ENTIRELY INSUFFICIENT UNLESS THE SUBSEQUENT STEPS ARE ALSO TAKEN. FIRST, TO IDENTIFY WHO THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WERE: THIS IS THE FIRST IMPORTANT POINT, BECAUSE NOBODY CAN FEEL SATISFIED IF ONLY LOW-RANKING OFFICERS ARE IDENTIFIED. SUCH AN ACT CAN ONLY HAVE BEEN ORDERED BY HIGH-RANKING OFFICERS. WE MUST NOT FORGET THE MURDER OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO, FOR WHICH THERE WERE NO SENTENCES AND NO TRIALS. HOWEVER, THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND IMMEDIATELY DENIED INVOLVEMENT IN THE OPERATION, STATING THAT IT WAS AN ISOLATED ACTION "DIVORCED FROM ANY INSTITUTIONAL POLICY." I BELIEVE THIS IS ENTIRELY WRONG: THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT FATHERS CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AN ISOLATED ACTION. OVER 7,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN EL SALVADOR DURING 10 YEARS OF CIVIL WAR, AND 90 PERCENT OF THEM WERE CIVILIANS. POLITICAL ASSASSINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT FORCES IS A CONSTANT PRACTICE. FURTHERMORE, TORTURE IS REGULARLY PRACTISED IN EL SALVADOR. THE ARMY HIGH COMMAND CANNOT FAIL TO KNOW THIS. THEY CANNOT CLAIM TO BE INNOCENT, BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE GREATEST RESPONSIBILITIES FOR HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. YET LAST MONTH THE SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN HEADS OF STATE IN SAN JOSE ENDED WITH A SUCCESS FOR PRESIDENT CRISTIANI, WHO SECURED AN EXPLICIT CONDEMNATION OF THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE GUERRILLAS IN NOVEMBER, WHEREAS NO SPECIFIC CHARGES WERE LEVELED AT THE GOVERNMENT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. THERE IS A POSITIVE FACTOR THAT SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND, NAMELY, THE CALL FROM THE FIVE PRESIDENTS FOR A RESUMPTION OF THE DIALOGUE IN EL SALVADOR AND THE APPEAL TO THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL TO CARRY OUT MEDIATION TO THIS END. BUT IN THE SUMMIT'S FINAL DOCUMENT, IT IS THE FMLN AND THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS WHO PAY THE PRICE FOR THE AGREEMENT AMONG THE PRESIDENTS: THESE ARE DIPLOMATIC GAMES THAT DO NOT FACILITATE THE RESTORATION OF PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA. WHAT PATHS CAN BE TAKEN NOW TO ADVANCE THE NEGOTIATIONS? NEGOTIATIONS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY NECESSARY. THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE SHOWS THAT THE FMLN IS A STRONG MILITARY FORCE, BUT ALSO THAT A REVOLUTIONARY ATTITUDE DOES NOT EXIST AMONG THE MASSES. IT ALSO SHOWS THAT THE GOVERNMENT ARMY, AFTER 10 YEARS OF U.S. TRAINING, IS AN ARMY WHOSE MILITARY STANCE IS DEFENSIVE, NOT OFFENSIVE WHILE THIS ALL SHOWS THAT THERE CAN ONLY BE A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS, IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT PRECISELY FOLLOWING THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE THE ARMY STIFFENED ITS STANCE AGAINST NEGOTIATIONS. I BELIEVE THAT SOONER OR LATER COMMON SENSE WILL PREVAIL AND IT WILL SIT DOWN AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE. AT THE END OF NOVEMBER THE U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE'S ASSISTANT FOR LATIN AMERICA SPOKE OFFICIALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT THE NEED FOR NEGOTIATIONS TO RESOLVE THE CRISIS IN EL SALVADOR: THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SIGN OF A CHANGING SITUATION.
DEV-MUC3-0023	LIMA, 11 JAN 90 -- THE MRTA TODAY DISTRIBUTED LEAFLETS CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MURDER OF FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER ENRIQUE LOPEZ ALBUJAR. GENERAL OSVALDO DIAZ SALVADOR, CHIEF OF THE 7TH SUBREGION OF THE NATIONAL POLICE, HAS CONFIRMED THE EXISTENCE OF THE LEAFLETS, AND ADDED THAT THE MURDER CASE IS STILL BEING INVESTIGATED. HE SAID THAT AMONG THE THOUSANDS OF DETAINEES THERE ARE 16 SUSPECTS WHO ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE MURDER OF THE OUTSTANDING GENERAL. WELL, THERE ARE TWO OPERATIONS. FIRST, THE DRAGNET OPERATION, IN WHICH PEOPLE WITH THE CHARACTERISTICS ESTABLISHED BY WITNESSES ARE ARRESTED, AND SECOND, THERE IS A MORE SPECIFIC OPERATION BEING CONDUCTED BY THE SPECIALIZED UNITS. IS THERE ANY INFORMATION YET REGARDING THE CAPTURE OF THE MURDERERS OF THE FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER? THESE OPERATIONS SEEK TO CLEAR UP BOTH A CRIME THAT HAS SHOCKED THE NATION AND ALSO THE KILLING OF TWO PATROLMEN WHO WERE MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD THE DAY BEFORE THE GENERAL WAS MURDERED. DO THE POLICE HAVE IDENTIKITS OF THE MURDERERS? WE HAVE RECEIVED SOME IDENTIKITS OF PEOPLE WHO COULD HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE ATTACK FROM THE SPECIALIZED UNITS OF THE TECHNICAL POLICE. BASED ON THESE IDENTIKITS THE POLICE WILL BE MORE SPECIFIC AND SELECTIVE. HOW MANY IDENTIKITS DO YOU HAVE SO FAR? SO FAR WE HAVE RECEIVED THREE IDENTIKITS. THE MURDER IS ATTRIBUTED TO MRTA AND NOT TO THE SHINING PATH. WHAT NEWS DO THE HAVE ON THIS? I BELIEVE THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES WILL HAVE THE FINAL WORD ON THIS. IS IT TRUE THAT THE MRTA HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MURDER? WELL, WE ALL KNOW THAT SOME LEAFLETS HAVE APPEARED TODAY INSIDE A NEWSPAPER THAT CLAIMS TO BE THE MOUTHPIECE ON THIS MATTER, BUT I DO NOT THINK THIS IS FINAL.
DEV-MUC3-0024	LA PAZ, 12 JAN 90 -- TWO BOMB ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT IN LA PAZ LAST NIGHT, ONE IN FRONT OF GOVERNMENT HOUSE FOLLOWING THE MESSAGE TO THE NATION OVER A RADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK BY PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA. THE EXPLOSIONS DID NOT CAUSE ANY SERIOUS DAMAGE BUT THE POLICE WERE MOBILIZED, FEARING A WAVE OF ATTACKS. THE SELF-STYLED "ZARATE WILLKA LIBERATION ARMED FORCES" SENT SIMULTANEOUS WRITTEN MESSAGES TO THE MEDIA, CALLING ON THE PEOPLE TO OPPOSE THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH IT SAYS IS "AT THE SERVICE OF THE WEALTHY AND THE EXPLOITERS." IT ALSO CALLS FOR FREE EDUCATION, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PERMANENT JOBS, THE DEFENSE OF COCA-LEAF FARMING, AND THE DEFENSE AGAINST U.S. INTERVENTION AND BIG LAND OWNERS. THE FIRST BOMB ATTACK OCCURRED AT 2230 IN FRONT OF THE PLANNING AND ECONOMIC COORDINATION MINISTRY, JUST BEFORE PRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA CONCLUDED HIS MESSAGE TO THE NATION IN WHICH HE EXPLAINED THE GUIDELINES OF THE GENERAL ECONOMIC PROGRAM THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL IMPLEMENT BETWEEN 1990 AND 1993. ROBERTO BARBERY, INTERIOR MINISTRY INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR, HAS REPORTED THAT DYNAMITE STICKS WERE HURLED FROM A CAR. THE SECOND ATTACK OCCURRED AT 2335 , JUST AFTER THE CABINET MEMBERS HAD LEFT GOVERNMENT HOUSE WHERE THEY HAD LISTENED TO THE PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE. A BOMB WAS PLACED OUTSIDE GOVERNMENT HOUSE IN THE PARKING LOT THAT IS USED BY CABINET MINISTERS. THE POLICE PLACED THE BOMB IN A NEARBY FLOWER BED, WHERE IT WENT OFF. THE SHOCK WAVE SHATTERED SOME WINDOWS IN GOVERNMENT HOUSE AND STREET LAMPS IN THE PLAZA MURILLO. AS OF 0500 GMT TODAY, THE POLICE HAD RECEIVED REPORTS OF TWO OTHER EXPLOSIONS IN TWO LA PAZ NEIGHBORHOODS, BUT THESE HAVE NOT YET BEEN CONFIRMED.
DEV-MUC3-0025	CLANDESTINE, 12 JAN 90 -- THE MNR REPORTS THE DISAPPEARANCE AND KIDNAPPING OF MNR ASSISTANT SECRETARY GENERAL HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES IN GUATEMALA CITY TODAY, 12 JANUARY. OQUELI ARRIVED IN GUATEMALA ON 11 JANUARY. HE HAD PLANNED TO TRAVEL TO NICARAGUA EARLY ON 12 JANUARY TO JOIN A SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL DELEGATION IN THAT COUNTRY. FROM NICARAGUA HE WOULD TRAVEL TO QUITO, ECUADOR, TO ATTEND A CONVENTION OF THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR LATIN AMERICA, OF WHICH OQUELI IS SECRETARY. ACCORDING TO REPORTS, OQUELI AND HIS COMPANION GILDA FLORES, A MEMBER OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF GUATEMALA, WERE ABDUCTED BY HEAVILY ARMED MEN BETWEEN 0630 AND 0700 AS THEY WERE HEADING TO LA AURORA AIRPORT TO BOARD THEIR FLIGHT. WE URGE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, PARTICULARLY THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS OF THE WORLD, TO DEMAND THE IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF HECTOR OQUELI AND HIS COMPANION, AS WELL AS A TOTAL CLARIFICATION OF THIS ATTACK. MNR NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 12 JANUARY 1990, SAN SALVADOR
DEV-MUC3-0026	SAN SALVADOR, 12 JAN 90 -- THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT TODAY DEPLORED THE DISAPPEARANCE OF SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES THIS MORNING IN GUATEMALA. NATIONAL INFORMATION SECRETARY MAURICIO SANDOVAL TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT "IT IS REGRETTABLE," ADDING THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WILL MAKE THE NECESSARY EFFORTS THROUGH DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION ON THE CASE. ACCORDING TO SOURCES FROM HIS PARTY, HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT DISAPPEARED TODAY IN GUATEMALA WHEN THE VEHICLE IN WHICH HE WAS TRAVELING WAS INTERCEPTED BY HEAVILY ARMED MEN WEARING CIVILIAN CLOTHING. AN MNR SPOLESMAN REPORTED THAT OQUELI COLINDRES WAS "KIDNAPPED" AS HE WAS HEADING TO THE AIRPORT IN GUATEMALA CITY TO TAKE A FLIGHT TO NICARAGUA, WHERE HE WOULD JOIN A SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL DELEGATION THAT IS CURRENTLY IN THAT COUNTRY TO OBSERVE THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN. MNR SPOKESMEN SAID THAT THE GUATEMALAN POLICE FOUND THE VEHICLE IN WHICH OQUELI WAS TRAVELING WITH A MEMBER OF THE GUATEMALAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY WITHOUT ITS OCCUPANTS.
DEV-MUC3-0027	SAN SALVADOR, 12 JAN 90 -- SALVADORAN VICE PRESIDENT FRANCISCO MERINO HAS DESCRIBED THE POSSIBLE RESUMPTION OF DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS AS POSITIVE. MERINO SAID THAT THE FMLN SHOULD NOT CLAIM CREDIT FOR THE RESUMPTION OF A DIALOGUE BECAUSE IT WAS PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI WHO TOOK THE INITIATIVE IN RESUMING THE TALKS. MERINO ADDED THAT THE REBELS SHOULD ABANDON THE DELAYING AND IRRESPONSIBLE TACTICS REGARDING THE DIALOGUE BECAUSE THE FMLN HAS LOST CREDIBILITY BOTH IN THE MILITARY SENSE AND IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICS. THE FMLN HAS LOST CREDIBILITY IN ALL OF ITS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING MILITARY ACTIONS. THE ONLY VALID ALTERNATIVE TO PACIFY THE COUNTRY IS FOR THE REBELS TO STOP HOSTILITIES, VIOLENCE, AND TERRORISM. WE SHOULD JOINTLY EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITIES OF THEIR JOINING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. HE ALSO SAID ONE OF THE ALTERNATIVES READILY AVAILABLE TO THE FMLN IS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS FOR DELEGATES TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PARLIAMENT. EL SALVADOR HAS PROPOSED AT THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY TO RATIFY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PARLIAMENT PROTOCOL. THIS WOULD OPEN THE DOOR FOR THE SPECIAL ELECTION OF THE SALVADORAN DELEGATES TO THE PARLIAMENT. IF A TRULY DEMOCRATIC WILLINGNESS BY THE FMLN EXISTS, THIS COULD BE THEIR FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE. IT HAS NOT YET BEEN DECIDED WHETHER THIS ELECTION WILL BE HELD BEFORE THE 1991 OFFICIAL ELECTIONS FOR MAYORS AND DEPUTIES. THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN COULD JOINTLY CONSIDER THE ADVANTAGES OF A SPECIAL ELECTION THIS YEAR. THEN WE COULD MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR THE 1991 CONSTITUTIONAL ELECTIONS. REGARDING THE FMLN MILITARY ACTIONS, MERINO SAID THE GOVERNMENT IS FAMILIAR WITH THE REBELS' TACTICS, PARTICULARLY WHEN TALKS ARE BEING CONSIDERED. HE ALSO SAID THE REBELS OPERATE IN CYCLES. THE GOVERNMENT HAS NEVER REACTED NAIVELY TO THE FMLN TERRORISTS' STATEMENTS OR THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE DIALOGUE. WE ARE FULLY AWARE OF THEIR PLANS AND STRATEGIES. THE GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, BEARS THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY OF SEEKING HARMONY AND THE CITIZENS'S SECURITY. AFTER THE REBELS' COUNTEROFFENSIVE IN NOVEMBER, WHICH WAS REGARDED AS THE LARGEST MILITARY OPERATION IN THE PAST 10 YEARS, THE POSSIBILITY FOR A NEW DIALOGUE HAS APPEARED IN EL SALVADOR ONCE MORE, CREATING EXPECTATIONS, BOTH HERE AND ABROAD. THE COMING MEETING OF PRESIDENT CRISTIANI WITH UNITED NATION'S REPRESENTATIVES, SCHEDULED FOR NEXT WEEK, AND THE MEETING ON 12 JANUARY OF A REBEL DELEGATION WITH A UNITED NATIONS OFFICIAL SEEM TO INDICATE THAT TALKS WILL BE HELD SHORTLY.
DEV-MUC3-0028	SAN SALVADOR, 12 JAN 90 -- SALVADORAN COLONEL SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ TODAY SAID THAT THE MASTERMINDS OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS' MURDER ARE NOT "SOLDIERS OR LIEUTENANTS," BUT ARE "MUCH HIGHER IN THE HIERARCHY." "REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT WAS A GENERAL OR COLONEL, WHOEVER MASTERMINDED THIS CRIME MUST BE PUNISHED," THE RANKING LEADER OF THE RULING ARENA PARTY AND RETIRED OFFICER SAID DURING A TELEVISED INTERVIEW. THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MULTIPLE MURDER THAT TOOK PLACE ON 16 NOVEMBER "ARE NOT SOLDIERS OR LIEUTENANTS," HE SAID. "THIS ACTION INVOLVED MUCH HIGHER LEVEL OFFICERS, AND EVEN IF A GENERAL OR COLONEL IS INVOLVED, MUST BE PUNISHED," HE POINTED OUT. HE ADDED: "WE HOPE THAT IT WILL NOT BE AS IN THE PAST WHEN THE MASTERMINDS ARE PROTECTED. AS THE SAYING GOES: THE LITTLE GUYS ALWAYS PAY." OCHOA SAID THAT HE IS CONVINCED THAT "INVESTIGATIONS MUST BE PURSUED" AND THAT NOBODY SHOULD RECEIVE "SPECIAL TREATMENT," BECAUSE "UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE ELEMENTS WHO ARE HURTING THE ARMY AND THE PRESIDENT, AND THE HIGH COMMAND HAVE TO PURGE THEM." OCHOA, FORMER DEPUTY AND CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE STATE POWER COMPANY, DESCRIBED AS "COURAGEOUS" THE DECISION OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI TO PUBLICLY ADMIT THAT MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES MASSACRED THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO WOMEN. ON 7 JANUARY, CRISTIANI OFFICIALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT MILITARY PERSONNEL KILLED THE JESUITS, THEIR COOK, AND THE COOK'S 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER. HOWEVER, HE REFUSED TO REVEAL THE NAMES OF THOSE INVOLVED TO AVOID HAMPERING THE INVESTIGATION. THE COLONEL SAID: "WE HOPE THAT THE NAMES WILL BE REVEALED SOON AND THAT THESE PEOPLE WILL BE PUNISHED." OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT OCHOA'S STATEMENTS, WHICH MIGHT SUGGEST AN INTERNAL STRUGGLE WITHIN THE RULING ARENA, EXPRESS AN IMPLICIT WISH TO SEE THIS ABOMINABLE CRIME RESOLVED." THE RETIRED COLONEL ADDED THAT THE "COURAGEOUS" POSITION OF CRISTIANI REGARDING THIS CASE HAS BROUGHT HIM STRONG INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT THAT IS HELPING TO STRENGTHEN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS THAT THE CURRENT PRESIDENT WANTS TO PROMOTE. ALTHOUGH OCHOA ADMITTED THAT IN EL SALVADOR MILITARY POWER HAS BEEN BEHIND THE REAL POWER AND THAT TRYING A MILITARY MAN HAS BEEN TABOO, HE SAID THAT CRISTIANI "IS DETERMINED TO INTENSIFY A PURGE OF SUCH ELEMENTS FROM THE ARMED FORCES." HE ALSO ADMITTED "THAT THERE ARE STILL SALVADORAN MILITARY MEN WHO BELIEVE THAT THEY HOLD POWER AND THAT THEY CAN USE THEIR RIFLES AND THE POWER THAT THEIR WEAPONS GIVE THEM."
DEV-MUC3-0029	CLANDESTINE, 12 JAN 90 -- THE U.S. CONGRESSMEN'S WORKTABLES ARE FILLED WITH SURPRISES. THEY ARE TO RENEW THEIR SESSIONS IN 2 WEEKS' TIME, AND IMPORTANT MATTERS ARE WAITING TO BE DISCUSSED. AFTER THE FMLN STARTED ITS 11 NOVEMBER OFFENSIVE WHICH BURIED THE ARMY'S PROPAGANDISTIC CLAIMS THAT IT HAD FINISHED OFF THE GUERRILLAS, ALONG CAME THE GREAT SURPRISES IN THE EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, WHEN THEY BROUGHT DOWN WALLS WITHOUT HAVING TO RESORT TO MILITARY INVASIONS AND ATTAINED A DEMOCRATIC OPENING. ENDING THE YEAR, THE WORLD WAS SURPRISED WITH THE BRUTAL U.S. INVASION OF PANAMA. NOW, WHEN THE LAST DECADE OF THE CENTURY IS ABOUT TO BEGIN, EL SALVADOR ADDS ANOTHER PAGE TO THE BOOK OF LAST-MINUTE SURPRISES. ALFREDO CRISTIANI HIMSELF--WHO, TOGETHER WITH ARMED FORCES OFFICERS, SAID HOURS AFTER THE JESUITS AND THEIR MAIDS HAD BEEN MURDERED THAT THERE WERE SUSPICIONS THAT THE FMLN COULD BE INVOLVED IN THE MASSACRE--HAS JUST ACCEPTED, ESPECIALLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE U.S. CONGRESS, THAT ARMED FORCES PERSONNEL WERE THE ONES WHO MURDERED THE TOP BRAINS, THE BEST INTELLECTUALS OF EL SALVADOR. THE MURDERERS WERE MILITARY PERSONNEL, AND, AT LEAST ON THE NATIONAL TELEVISON NETWORK, CRISTIANI PROMISED TO DISLOSE THEIR NAMES. ...THE JESUITS' MURDERS OR THE CANCELLATION OF AID. IF IT IS TRUE THAT THE ARMY--WHICH MURDERED MONSIGNO OSCAR ROMERO, 1,000 PEASANTS IN EL MOZOTE, 70 INDIANS IN LAS HOJAS, HUNDREDS OF SALVADORANS IN ZUNPU, AND UNIONISTS AT THE FENASTRAS OFFICES, ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE ARMED FORCES' WELL-KNOWN CRIMES--IS GOING TO BE PURGED AT LAST, IF THIS IS REALLY TRUE, THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT A TRUE NEGOTIATION WILL START. IN THE PAST, THE FMLN HAS MADE PROPOSALS FOR NEGOTIATIONS TO END THE WAR. ONE OF OUR DEMANDS, A REALISTIC DEMAND TO PROPITIATE PEACE IN EL SALVADOR, IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE PURGE OF THE ARMY. IN MEXCIO AND IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, WE SAID THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT ACCEPT THE FMLN'S PROPOSAL, THE NATION WOULD DO SO. AND THAT IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED. THE NATION DEMANDS THAT THE ARMED FORCES BE PURGED. THE MOST IMPORTANT U.S. NEWSPAPERS AND NEWSCASTS HAVE NOTED THE IRREFUTABLE FACT THAT 10 YEARS OF U.S. ADVICE AND AN INVESTMENT OF MORE THAN $3 BILLION--VERY CLOSE TO $4 BILLION--TO CREATE A HUGE BUILDUP IN THEIR ARMAMENTS HAVE NOT SERVED TO CHANGE THE MENTALITY OF AN ARMY THAT MURDERED MONSIGNOR ROMERO AND THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS, INCLUDING NUNS AND U.S. ADVISERS. WE BELIEVE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR CHRISTOPHER DODD WAS MISTAKEN WHEN HE SAID THAT U.S. AID IN ITSELF WAS NOT BEING DISCUSSED. THE 10 YEARS OF AID, ADVICE, AND U.S. STRATEGY IN EL SALVADOR HAVE PROVEN TO BE A FAILURE. IF THE UNITED STATES HAS ANY INTENTIONS OF CONTRIBUTING TO PEACE, NOW IS THE TIME TO CHANGE ITS POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR. EVENTS HAVE PLACED THE ISSUE OF THE CONTINUATION OF AID TO EL SALVADOR ON THE CONGRESSMEN'S WORKTABLES. THE AID WAS MADE CONDITIONAL ON PUNISHMENT FOR THE JESUITS' MURDERS. BUT WHAT IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY? IT IS A DECISION THAT GOES BEYOND A BASIC DEMAND FOR JUSTICE. IT WILL DETERMINE THE CONTINUATION OF U.S. AID. IT ENTAILS THE DECISION TO TURN THEIR POLICY AROUND TO CONTRIBUTE TO A POLITICAL SOLUTION IN EL SALVADOR. THEY ARE TO DISCUSS WHETHER CONGRESS' POSITION IS TO BE: ONE, WE APPROVE THE PURGE OF THE ARMY AND THUS WE WILL GIVE THEM MORE AID, OR, TWO, WE APPROVE THE PURGE AS A CONCRETE STEP TO DEMOCRATIZATION AND WILL SUSPEND MILITARY AID SO THAT THESE CONDITIONS CAN BE USED TO REACH A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION. WILL U.S. CONGRESSMEN BE CAPABLE OF SURPRISING THE WORLD BY HELPING THE SALVADORANS TO TOPPLE THE FASCIST WALL, THE WALL OF WAR? WILL THEY DO THIS BY STOPPING MILITARY AID? THE FMLN HAS SAID CLEARLY THAT IF THE UNITED STATES STOPS AID TO THE ARMY IT WILL CORRESPOND WITH ACTIONS TO REACH A COMPLETE HALT IN HOSTILITIES. WE HOPE THE U.S. CONGRESS DOES NOT MAKE A MISTAKE. IF IT STOPS AID, IF IT CUTS IT, IF IT ENDS IT, WE WILL STAND BEFORE A CLEAR AND HOPEFUL SIGN FOR PEACE. HOWEVER, IF NOT, WE WILL STAND BEFORE YET ANOTHER SIGN OF WAR, AND THE SURPRISE WILL NOT BE A GOOD ONE.
DEV-MUC3-0030	BOGOTA, 12 JAN 90 -- IT WAS REPORTED IN BOGOTA TODAY THAT THE COLOMBIAN ARMY CAPTURED SUSPECTED PERUVIAN DRUG TRAFFICKER JOSE CARDENAS GUERRA ON A FARM IN PURIFICACION, IN CENTRAL COLOMBIA. CARDENAS GUERRA IS APPARENTLY LINKED TO THE MEDELLIN DRUG CARTEL. THE SOLDIERS FOUND CARDENAS GUERRA WITH SEVERAL WORKERS OF THE FARM, WHICH, ACCORDING TO THE INVESTIGATIONS, WAS OWNED BY GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, WHO WAS KILLED DURING A POLICE OPERATION ON 15 DECEMBER. OFFICIAL SPOKESMEN INDICATED THAT THE TROOPS DID NOT MEET ANY RESISTANCE FROM THE SUSPECTED MAFIA MEMBERS WHO WERE CARRYING FIREARMS. CARDENAS GUERRA WAS TRANSFERRED FROM PURIFICACION TO THE SECRET POLICE OFFICES IN IBAGUE, CAPITAL OF TOLIMA DEPARTMENT, 130 KM SOUTHWEST OF BOGOTA.
DEV-MUC3-0031	GUATEMALA CITY, 13 JAN 90 -- MARIO SOLORZANO MARTINEZ, LEADER OF GUATEMALA'S DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PARTY, REPORTED TODAY THAT THE SALVADORAN POLITICAL LEADER HECTOR OQUELI, WHO WAS KIDNAPPED IN GUATEMALA, WAS FOUND DEAD. OQUELI'S BODY WAS FOUND NEXT TO THE BODY OF GUATEMALAN POLITICIAN GILDA FLORES, WHO WAS TAKING HIM TO THIS CITY'S AIRPORT SO THAT OQUELI COULD TRAVEL TO NICARAGUA. SOLORZANO MARTINEZ TOLD NOTIMEX THAT , BECAUSE OF THE SHORT PERIOD OF TIME OQUELI WAS IN GUATEMALA--LESS THAN 24 HOURS--THE ONLY EXPLANATION IS THAT THERE ARE GROUPS LINKED TO THE SALVADORAN PARAMILITARY SQUADRONS IN THE COUNTRY.
DEV-MUC3-0032	CLANDESTINE, 13 JAN 90 -- REGARDING THE ASSASSINATION OF HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES, LEADER OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE AND SECRETARY FOR LATIN AMERICA OF THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL, IN GUATEMALA ON 12 JANUARY, WE STATE: 1. WE BLAME ARENA , THE REGIME OF CRISTIANI AND D'AUBUISSON, AND ITS ARMED FORCES FOR THIS DETESTABLE ASSASSINATION. THE LINKS BETWEEN D'AUBUISSON'S ARENA PARTY AND THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENT OF MARIO SANDOVAL ARE WELL KNOWN. BOTH OPPOSE EVERY EFFORT TO BRING PEACE TO THE REGION. 2. THIS NEW CRIME AND THE RECENT EVENTS CONCERNING THE CASE OF THE JESUITS, WHICH SHOW THAT THE MASTERMINDS WILL NOT BE PUNISHED, FORCES US TO REVIEW OUR DIALOGUE OFFER BECAUSE WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN HELPING THE FASCIST REGIME WASH ITS FACE TO OBTAIN U.S. MILITARY AID AND TO PROCEED WITH ITS PLAN TO ANNIHILATE EVERY TYPE OF OPPOSITION. 3. THE ASSASSINATION OF DR OQUELI AND HIS COMPANION, GILDA FLORES, THE EXTENSION OF THE STATE OF THE SIEGE, AND THE FACT THAT NOTHING INDICATES THAT THERE WILL BE PUNISHMENT FOR THE MASTERMINDS OF THE MASSACRE OF 16 NOVEMBER SHOW THAT CRISTIANI'S ANNOUNCEMENT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LATTER CASE IS ONLY A FARCE TO OBTAIN U.S. AID AND TO PROCEED WITH THE SLAUGHTER OF OPPOSITION MEMBERS. 4. AS THOSE EVENTS SHOW, THE POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFICT REQUIRES A PURGE OF THE ARMED FORCES, DEMOCRATIZATION, AND SELF-DETERMINATION. THERE CAN BE NO DIALOGUE AMID STATE TERRORISM, A STATE OF SIEGE, AND GENERAL TRAMPLING ON HUMAN RIGHTS. UNDER THE STATE OF SIEGE, THE REGIME GIVES ITSELF THE RIGHT TO CARRY OUT A GENERAL REPRESSION. THEREFORE, WE CALL ON ALL POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES TO STRUGGLE FOR ITS ABROGATION. 5. THE 15 DECEMBER 1989 UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION DEMANDING RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRATIC FREEDOMS MUST BE UNCONDITIONALLY IMPLEMENTED IN OUR COUNTRY TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE AND CONDITIONS FAVORABLE TO A POLITICAL SOLUTION. FMLN GENERAL COMMAND EL SALVADOR, 13 JANUARY 1990
DEV-MUC3-0033	SAN SALVADOR, 13 JAN 90 -- THE SALVADORAN OPPOSITION NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT TODAY DEMANDED THAT GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO "THOROUGHLY" INVESTIGATE THE ASSASSINATION OF MNR LEADER HECTOR OQUELI AND OF GUATEMALAN ATTORNEY GILDA FLORES. DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE, THE MNR EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE CONDEMNED THE "ABOMINABLE" CRIME PERPETRATED ON 12 JANUARY IN GUATEMALA BY ARMED MEN WEARING CIVILIAN CLOTHES. THE MNR ALSO DEMANDED THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF MNR SECRETARY GENERAL GUILLERMO UNGO, WHO WILL ARRIVE IN EL SALVADOR WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS TO ATTEND OQUELI'S FUNERAL, WHICH IS SCHEDULED FOR 15 JANUARY. OQUELI, 45, AND GILDA FLORES, A MEMBER OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PARTY OF GUATEMALA, WERE KIDNAPPED WHILE THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO LA AURORA AIRPORT IN GUATEMALA CITY. THEIR BODIES WERE FOUND LATER AT A PLACE NEAR THE SALVADORAN BORDER. "THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS UNJUSTIFIABLE ASSASSINATION ARE THE ETERNAL ENEMIES OF LIBERTY, PEACE, AND DEMOCRACY," THE MNR STATES. THE MNR, ALONG WITH THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT , MAKE UP THE DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE COALITION. THE MPSC ALSO ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE DEPLORING THE ASSASSINATION OF OQUELI AND URGING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO CONDEMN THIS ACTION.
DEV-MUC3-0034	CLANDESTINE, 13 JAN 90 -- WHAT WE HAD PREDICTED HAS OCCURRED. CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED THIS AFTERNOON THAT A COLONEL, TWO LIEUTENANTS, ONE SECOND LIEUTENANT, TWO SECOND SERGEANTS, AND TWO SOLDIERS WERE INVOLVED IN THE MASSACRE OF THE JESUITS. THE ACCUSATION AGAINST COLONEL BENAVIDES IS THE FOLLOWING: THAT THE MULTIPLE CRIME WAS COMMITTED IN THE SECTOR UNDER HIS COMMAND. FROM THE LIEUTENANT ON DOWN, THE ACCUSATION IS THAT THEY DIRECTLY PARTICIPATED IN THE CRIME. , AS CRISTIANI SAID, THAT IT WAS COL BENAVIDES, BUT IT WAS NOT COL BENAVIDES WHO ISSUED THE ORDER. SO, THE QUESTION IS: WHO GAVE THE ORDER TO KILL THE JESUITS AND THEIR TWO MAIDS. IN OUR VIEW, COL BENAVIDES WAS IMPLICATED SOLELY AS A MEANS OF PROPAGANDA AIMED AT THE U.S. CONGRESS. IT IS CLEAR THAT COL BENAVIDES DID NOT GIVE THE ORDER. HE PROBABLY DID NOT EVEN KNOW ABOUT THE ACTION. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND. FIRST, HE IS NOT KNOWN TO HAVE CARRIED OUT ACTS OF REPRESSION OR CORRUPTION. OUR REPORT INDICATES THAT BENAVIDES HAS MAINTAINED A POSITION IN FAVOR OF INSTITUTIONS AND OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS. HE WAS DESCRIBED AS AN ACTIVE, STUDIOUS AND NOT REPRESSIVE CADET, ONE OF THE FEW EXCEPTIONS IN LA TANDONA . IN OTHER WORDS, FOR THE LA TANDONA, A GANG OF ASSASSINS, HE IS A PERFECT SCAPEGOAT. THE MASSACRE OF THE JESUITS WAS NOT A PERSONAL DECISION. IT WAS PART OF THE ARMED FORCES' COUNTEROFFENSIVE ACTIONS DURING THE NOVEMBER BATTLES. IT WAS A COLD-BLOODED, PREMEDITATED PLAN EXECUTED TO DECAPITATE THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION. LET US REMEMBER THE THREATS AGAINST FATHER ELLACURIA OVER THE NATIONAL RADIO NETWORK PRIOR TO THE ASSASSINATION. LET US REMEMBER THAT BETWEEN THE NIGHT OF 15 NOVEMBER AND EARLY MORNING OF 16 NOVEMBER, SEVERAL OFFICES OF LABOR UNIONS AND HOUSES OF OPPOSITION MEMBERS WERE ATTACKED. LET US REMEMBER THAT AFTER THE MASSSACRE OF THE JESUITS, THE OFFICERS SHOUTED OVER LOUDSPEAKERS THAT THEY HAD KILLED ELLACURIA AND THAT THEY WERE GOING TO CONTINUE KILLING COMMUNISTS. THE BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR WAS A WITNESS TO THIS. IN OUR VIEW, THE ASSASSINS OF THE JESUITS WERE THOSE WHO APPEARED ON THE RADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK MAKING KNOWN THE RESULTS OF THE SO-CALLED HONOR COMMISSION. COL BENAVIDES WILL PROBABLY BE FREED IN A SHORT TIME AND BE APPOINTED TO SOME POST ABROAD, OR HE MIGHT EXPERIENCE THE SAME FATE AS THAT OF CAPTAIN EDUARDO ALFONSO AVILA, WHO WENT IN AND OUT OF JAIL EACH TIME THAT MILITARY AID FOR EL SALVADOR WAS DISCUSSED IN THE U.S. CONGRESS. HOWEVER, IN ANY CASE AND AS HAS ALWAYS OCCURRED, IT WILL BE THE LIEUTENANTS, THE NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND THE SOLDIERS WHO CARRIED OUT AN ORDER WHO WILL PAY THE CONSEQUENCES. WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THIS HAPPEN IN THE CASES OF THE NUNS WHEN A FEW SOLDIERS, THE MASSACRE OF SAN FRANCISCO, AND THE ASSASSINATION OF THE U.S. ADVISERS AND RODOLFO VIERA. ONCE AGAIN THE PEOPLE'S HOPES ARE FRUSTRATED, AS HAS HAPPENED IN SO MANY OTHER CASES. THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUITS AGAIN CONFIRMS THAT TO, AS CRISTIANI SAID, GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS, WE HAVE TO OBTAIN DEMOCRACY, JUSTICE, AND SELF-DETERMINATION.
DEV-MUC3-0035	SAN SALVADOR, 13 JAN 90 -- THE NEW FMLN PROPOSAL TO STOP FIGHTING PROVIDED THE U.S. CONGRESS SUSPENDS AID TO EL SALVADOR IS BLACKMAIL. WITH THIS, HE SAID, THE FMLN IS SHOWING TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT ITS MEMBERS ARE PLAIN TERRORISTS. THIS WAS SAID ON 12 JANUARY BY THE RULING NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE PRESIDENT DR ARMANDO CALDERON SOL, WHO MAINTAINED THAT ASPIRATIONS OF THE SUBSERSIVES ARE "DETESTABLE," AND, THEREFORE, CANNOT BE ACCEPTED. THE PROMINENT POLITICAL LEADER SAID THAT WHILE IN EAST EUROPE THERE IS A TRUE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION, THE FMLN MAINTAINS ITS POSITION OF TRYING TO SUBDUE THE PEOPLE WITH A TOTALITARIAN PLAN THROUGH VIOLENT MEANS. "HISTORY HAS LEFT THEM BEHIND AND THEY HAVE NOT NOTICED IT," HE ADDED. CALDERON SOL EMPHASIZED THAT FMLN LEADERS SHOULD RECONSIDER THE POSITION THEY HAVE MAINTAINED AND SHOULD RESPECT THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM BECAUSE WITHOUT IT, NO NATION CAN ACHIEVE HARMONY AND DEVELOPMENT. THE SEDITIOUS "SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE ALONE AND THAT NO ONE SUPPORTS THEIR ANARCHIC PLAN," THE ARENA PRESIDENT ADDED. HE RECALLED THAT DURING THE TERRORIST AGGRESSION, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SUPORTED THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN NEVER RECEIVED ANY SUPPORT. CALDERON SOL STRESSED THAT THE FMLN MUST PROVIDE REAL PROOF THAT IT WANTS TO REACH PEACE THROUGH NEGOTIATED MEANS, BECAUSE PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HAS GOOD INTENTIONS AND WANTS TO SOLVE THE CONFLICT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THROUGH TALKS. THE SUBVERSIVES MUST SUSPEND THE AGGRESSION AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY, BECAUSE ONE CANNOT BE AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE WHILE THE FMLN AT THE SAME TIME IS PREPARING AN OFFENSIVE.
DEV-MUC3-0036	GUATEMALA CITY, 13 JAN 90 -- THE GUATEMALAN FOREIGN MINISTRY CONDEMNED TODAY THE ASSASSINATION OF LEFTIST SALVADORAN LEADER HECTOR OQUELI AND GUATEMALAN POLITICAL LEADER GILDA FLORES. BOTH BODIES WERE FOUND TODAY IN AN AREA NEAR GUATEMALA AND EL SALVADOR BORDER AFTER THE VICTIMS WERE KIDNAPPED IN GUATEMALA CITY YESTERDAY. A FOREIGN MINISTRY COMMUNIQUE "REGRETS AND CONDEMNS" THE ASSASSINATION OF OQUELI, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL FOR LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN, AND DEPUTY SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT , A LEFTIST MOVEMENT IN EL SALVADOR. "WE DEEPLY REGRET THE DEATHS OF TWO VALUABLE PERSONS, AND WE CONDEMN THIS ACT OF VIOLENCE," THE NOTE ADDS. THE DOCUMENT IS THE FIRST OFFICIAL REACTION TO THE KIDNAPPING AND ASSASSINATION OF BOTH LEADERS. GILDA FLORES WAS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PARTY OF GUATEMALA, WHOSE SECRETARY GENERAL MARIO SOLORZANO REPORTED THAT "SALVADORAN PARAMILITARY GROUPS" ARE CARRYING OUT ACTIONS IN THIS COUNTRY. ACCORDING TO SOLORZANO, THE INCIDENT "SHOWS THERE IS COOPERATION BETWEEN PARAMILITARY GROUPS OF BOTH COUNTRIES," BECAUSE THE PERPETRATORS KNEW OF OQUELI'S ARRIVAL "AND THEY STAGED AN ENTIRE OPERATION TO KIDNAP HIM." THE BODIES OF THE POLITICAL LEADERS WERE FOUND EARLY THIS MORNING WITH SHOTS THROUGH THE TEMPLE IN THE GUATEMALAN TOWN OF JALPATAGUA, NEAR THE BORDER WITH EL SALVADOR, OQUELI'S RELATIVES TOLD EFE IN EL SALVADOR. OQUELI ARRIVED IN GUATEMALA LAST THURSDAY. ON FRIDAY MORNING, WHILE ON HIS WAY TO LA AURORA AIRPORT TO CATCH A PLANE TO NICARAGUA, HE WAS KIDNAPPED BY "HEAVILY ARMED MEN," ACCORDING TO THE MNR.
DEV-MUC3-0037	GUATEMALA CITY, 13 JAN 90 -- GOVERNMENT MINISTER CARLOS MORALES SAID TODAY THAT A "FOREIGN COMMANDO" KILLED HECTOR OQUELI, LEADER OF THE SALVADORAN LEFTIST PARTY NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT , AND GUATEMALAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER GILDA FLORES IN GUATEMALA. MORALES SAID AT A NEWS CONFERENCE HELD AT THE NATIONAL POLICE HEADQUARTERS THAT THE INTENTION OF THE "TERRORIST COMMANDO" WAS CAPTURING OQUELI ALIVE TO TAKE HIM TO EL SALVADOR BUT THAT "SOMETHING MADE THEM CHANGE THEIR PLANS." MORALES STRESSED THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE "FOREIGN COMMANDO," THE NATIONALITY AND ORIGIN OF WHOM HE DID NOT SPECIFY, HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR MONTHS, ADDING THAT "IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY TERRORIST ATTACKS." MORALES SAID THAT THE GROUP HAS KILLED SEVERAL PEOPLE AND HAS CARRIED OUT VARIOUS BOMB ATTACKS IN GUATEMALA. ASKED ABOUT A STATEMENT BY SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADER MARIO SOLORZANO, WHO SAID THAT SALVADORAN AND GUATEMALAN PARAMILITARY GROUPS OPERATE JOINTLY IN GUATEMALA, MORALES SAID THAT "THIS IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION." "WE CANNOT SAY WHAT COUNTRY THIS TERRORIST COMMANDO CAME FROM; HOWEVER, WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN MEASURES TO COUNTER ITS ACTIVITIES IN OUR NATIONAL TERRITORY," HE STRESSED. OUR GOVERNMENT WILL NOT LET THIS GROUP "DEFAME" GUATEMALA WITH ITS ACTIVITIES. THERE IS ALREADY A SPECIAL UNIT WITHIN THE SECURITY FORCES IN CHARGE OF LOCATING THE KILLERS OF OQUELI AND FLORES. ACCORDING TO THE INITIAL REPORTS RECEIVED BY THE POLICE, THE KIDNAPPING TOOK PLACE YESTERDAY WHEN OQUELI AND FLORES WERE HEADING TO LA AURORA AIRPORT IN THIS CAPITAL. THE VEHICLE IN WHICH THEY WERE TRAVELING, WHICH WAS FOUND NEAR THE AIRPORT, WAS INTERCEPTED BY ANOTHER CAR, WHOSE OCCUPANTS FORCED GILDA FLORES OUT OF THE CAR WHILE OQUELI TRIED TO ESCAPE, MORALES SAID.
DEV-MUC3-0038	SAN SALVADOR, 15 JAN 90 -- ARMANDO CALDERON SOL, PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE , THE RULING SALVADORAN PARTY, TODAY CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION INTO ANY POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE MILITARY PERSONNEL IMPLICATED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS. "IT IS SOMETHING SO HORRENDOUS, SO MONSTROUS, THAT WE MUST INVESTIGATE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE FMLN STAGED THIS ASSASSINATION TO DISCREDIT THE GOVERNMENT," CALDERON SOL SAID. SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI IMPLICATED FOUR OFFICERS, INCLUDING ONE COLONEL, AND FIVE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES IN THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO WOMEN ON 16 NOVEMBER AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY. ACCORDING TO CALDERON SOL, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT "IS DUTYBOUND TO UNCOVER THE MURDERERS OF THE JESUITS AND TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY LINK BETWEEN THE SOLDIERS INVOLVED AND THE FMLN." "THOSE RESPONSIBLE ACTED ON THEIR OWN, TO CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND DISCREDIT IT. IT COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE AN ISOLATED ACT. INVESTIGATIONS ARE POINTING TO SOME KIND OF CONSPIRACY," THE PRESIDENT OF THE RIGHTIST ARENA PARTY SAID. IN ADDITION, CALDERON SOL ASKED THE GOVERNMENTS OF EL SALVADOR AND GUATEMALA TO CARRY OUT AN "EXHAUSTIVE" INVESTIGATION TO ENSURE THAT THE MURDER OF SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES "DOES NOT GO UNPUNISHED." CALDERON NOTED THAT "OQUELI HAD CLEARLY RENOUNCED THE POSITION OF ARMED STRUGGLE IN FAVOR OF A PROGRAM FOR DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION." OQUELI COLINDRES, A SALVADORAN LEADER OF THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL, WAS FOUND DEAD ALONG WITH GILDA FLORES, A MEMBER OF THE GUATEMALAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY, ON 13 JANUARY IN A TOWN IN SOUTHEASTERN GUATEMALA NEAR THE SALVADORAN BORDER.
DEV-MUC3-0039	SAN SALVADOR, 15 JAN 90 -- SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI TODAY POSTPONED HIS TRIP TO THE UNITED STATES, WHICH WAS SCHEDULED FOR 16-23 JANUARY, UNTIL LATER THIS MONTH, ACCORDING TO AN ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY BY INFORMATION SECRETARY MAURICIO SANDOVAL. THE PRESIDENTIAL SPOKESMAN EXPLAINED THAT THE POSTPONEMENT OF CRISTIANI'S TRIP IS DUE TO THE PRESIDENT'S INTEREST IN MEETING WITH UN SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR TO REQUEST THAT PEREZ DE CUELLAR ACT AS MEDIATOR TO ACHIEVE THE RESUMPTION OF DIALOGUE WITH THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS. "WE HAVE RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM NEW YORK TO THE EFFECT THAT PEREZ DE CUELLAR WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE ON THE DATES INITIALLY SET FOR THE TRIP, THUS, CRISTIANI'S VISIT HAS BEEN POSTPONED, SANDOVAL SAID. ACCORDING TO SANDOVAL, CRISTIANI WILL MEET WITH PEREZ DE CUELLAR ON 31 JANUARY, AFTER WHICH HE WILL GO TO WASHINGTON IN EARLY FEBRUARY TO MEET WITH U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH. SANDOVAL DENIED THAT THE POSTPONEMENT OF CRISTIANI'S TRIP IS RELATED TO POSSIBLE REACTION TO THE ARREST OF EIGHT MEMBERS OF THE ARMY, INCLUDING FOUR OFFICERS, ON CHARGES OF BEING IMPLICATED IN THE MURDER OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO EMPLOYEES. "THERE IS NO RELATION, BECAUSE THE CASE OF THE JESUITS IS BEING RESOLVED," THE SPOKESMAN SAID. SANDOVAL ALSO DENIED THAT POSTPONEMENT OF THE TRIP IS LINKED TO THE ASSASSINATION OF HECTOR OQUELI, A SALVADORAN LEADER OF THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL, 3 DAYS AGO IN GUATEMALA. AFTER LEARNING OF OQUELI'S ASSASSINATION, THE GUERRILLAS ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL "REVISE" THEIR OFFER TO RESUME THE DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER, THE PRESIDENTIAL SPOKESMAN INDICATED THAT THE GUERRILLAS HAVE SENT NO OFFICIAL NOTE EXPLAINING THE REVISION.
DEV-MUC3-0040	BOGOTA, 15 JAN 90 -- IN AN ACTION THAT IS UNPRECEDENTED IN COLOMBIA'S HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS KIDNAPPED 31 PEOPLE IN THE STRIFE-TORN BANANA-GROWING REGION OF URABA, THE ANTIOUQIA GOVERNOR'S OFFICE REPORTED TODAY. THE INCIDENT TOOK PLACE IN PUERTO BELLO, A VILLAGE IN TURBO MUNICIPALITY, 460 KM NORTHWEST OF BOGOTA, WHERE A GROUP OF HEAVILY ARMED MEN FORCED THE KIDNAPPED VILLAGERS TO CLIMB INTO TRUCKS AND THEN TOOK OFF FOR AN UNKNOWN DESTINATION. NOTHING IS KNOWN THUS FAR ABOUT THE MOTIVE BEHIND THE KIDNAPPING OR THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE VICTIMS. REGIONAL AUTHORITIES WHO ESCAPED BEING KIDNAPPED TOOK A CENSUS OF THE POPULATION AND DETERMINED THAT A TOTAL OF 31 PEOPLE WERE KIDNAPPED. BEFORE FLEEING, THE COMMANDO GROUP SET FIRE TO A GROCERY STORE AND CAUSED SOME DAMAGE IN THE SMALL TOWN. URABA, A PROSPEROUS AGRO-INDUSTRIAL REGION IN COLOMBIA, HAS BEEN RACKED FOR YEARS BY A BLOODY POLITICAL STRUGGLE BETWEEN GUERRILLA GROUPS AND ULTRARIGHTIST PARAMILITARY BANDS, WHICH HAVE BEEN BLAMED FOR VARIOUS MASSACRES OF PEASANTS WHOM THEY ACCUSED OF BEING GUERRILLA SYMPATHIZERS. BEFORE THE NEWS OF THE MASS KIDNAPPING BECAME KNOWN, THE TOTAL PERSONS KIDNAPPED IN COLOMBIA OVER THE LAST 6 WEEKS WAS 85, ACCORDING TO STATISTICS OF THE COLOMBIAN SECRET POLICE.
DEV-MUC3-0041	LIMA, 15 JAN 90 -- THE PERUVIAN POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT AN ATTACK WITH EXPLOSIVES IN FRONT OF A BUILDING WHERE U.S. DIPLOMATS RESIDE IN THE MIRAFLORES NEIGHBORHOOD IN LIMA HAS LEFT ONE PERSON INJURED. THE TERRORIST ATTACK WAS LAUNCHED FROM A MOVING VEHICLE, FROM WHICH UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS THREW THREE DYNAMITE CHARGES THAT INJURED A PASSERBY AND DAMAGED THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING, ACCORDING TO THE POLICE. THE POLICE SOURCE INDICATED THAT THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIME HAVE NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED. THE SOURCE NOTED THAT IN 1984, THE FIRST ATTACK ON U.S. INTERESTS WAS CARRIED OUT BY THE GUEVARIST TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT, WHEN ACTIVISTS FROM THAT GROUP FIRED AT THE FRONT OF THE U.S. EMBASSY IN DOWNTOWN LIMA. A CAR BOMB EXPLODED IN FRONT OF THE U.S. EMBASSY RESIDENCE IN THE PERUVIAN CAPITAL 3 YEARS LATER, AND AFTER THAT, EXPLOSIVES WERE HURLED AT THE DOOR OF A HOUSE IN THE SAN BORJA NEIGHBORHOOD, WHERE U.S. MARINES RESIDED.
DEV-MUC3-0042	LIMA, 16 JAN 90 -- TEN TERRORISTS HURLED DYNAMITE STICKS AT U.S. EMBASSY FACILITIES IN THE MIRAFLORES DISTRICT, CAUSING SERIOUS DAMAGE BUT FORTUNATELY NO CASUALTIES. THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE AT 2100 ON 15 JANUARY . INSIDE THE FACILITY, WHICH WAS GUARDED BY 3 SECURITY OFFICERS, A GROUP OF EMBASSY OFFICIALS WERE HOLDING A WORK MEETING. ACCORDING TO THE FIRST POLICE REPORTS, THE ATTACK WAS STAGED BY 10 TERRORISTS WHO USED 2 TOYOTA CARS WHICH WERE LATER ABANDONED. ONE OF THE VEHICLES WAS LEFT ON THE THIRD BLOCK OF JOSE PARDO AVENUE, WHILE THE OTHER WAS LEFT ON THE FIRST BLOCK OF BELLA VISTA STREET IN MIRAFLORES.
DEV-MUC3-0043	MADRID , 26 JAN 89 -- NAPOLEON DUARTE, PRESIDENT OF EL SALVADOR, HAS REJECTED THE PROPOSAL FROM THE GUERRILLAS, WHO ACCEPTED THE ELECTIONS IF THEY WERE POSTPONED FOR 6 MONTHS AND HELD WITH DEMOCRATIC GUARANTEES. TODAY A DELEGATION OF THE SALVADORAN INSURGENTS WILL HOLD TALKS IN MADRID WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SPANISH FOREIGN MINISTRY. THE SPANISH OFFICIALS' INTERLOCUTOR IS MIGUEL SAENZ, MEMBER OF THE POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC COMMISSION OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT AND THIS IS HIS FIRST REACTION, IN EXCLUSIVE STATEMENTS TO RNE , TO NAPOLEON DUARTE'S REJECTION OF THE INSURGENTS' PROPOSAL. THE ONLY WAY LEFT IS TO CONTINUE THE STRUGGLE, AND THUS WE WOULD HAVE TO INTENSIFY THIS STRUGGLE IN THE POLITICAL AND MILITARY FIELD. THEN, UNFAILINGLY, IF THERE IS NO POLITICAL SOLUTION, THERE WILL BE A SOCIAL EXPLOSION IN THE COUNTRY. IT IS UNSTOPPABLE. WE BELIEVE THAT SPAIN IN PARTICULAR, AS PRESIDENT OF THE EEC, WITH THE TRADITIONAL, CULTURAL TIES UNITING US, CAN PLAY QUITE A PROMINENT ROLE. SPECIFICALLY, WE BELIEVE THAT THE EEC CAN INTERCEDE WITH ITS OFFICES BETWEEN THE PARTIES IN CONFLICT IN ORDER TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE RESOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT.
DEV-MUC3-0044	PANAMA CITY , 26 JAN 89 -- EXPLOSIVES LOADED IN A SMALL TRUCK, WHICH WERE GOING TO BE FIRED AT THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENTIAL HOUSE, WERE DEACTIVATED AT NOON TODAY, A MILITARY SOURCE HAS REPORTED. THREE HANDMADE CATAPULTS, EACH LOADED WITH APPROXIMATELY 7 KG OF DYNAMITE, WERE DEFUSED AT 1145 BY NATIONAL POLICEMEN. THE CATAPULTS WERE LOCATED 200 METERS FROM THE PRESIDENCY AND WERE TO BE FIRED 10 MINUTES LATER, COPREFA REPORTED. ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLAS, THE "MOBILE ARMED PLATFORMS," SORT OF LIKE MEDIEVAL CATAPULTS, CONSIST OF TWO PARTS: A FUSE AND A MAIN CHARGE. THE PRESIDENTIAL HOUSE IS LOCATED IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF SAL SALVADOR ADJACENT TO ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL GARRISONS OF EL SALVADOR, THE ARMED FORCES TRANSMISSION CENTER. IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS, THE FMLN HAS USED SO-CALLED "MOBILE ARMED PLATFORMS" AGAINST THE PRINCIPAL ARMY GARRISONS IN SAN SALVADOR. THE ARMY DESCRIBED THESE DEVICES AS "TERRORIST WEAPONS" AND LABELED THEM "CAR BOMBS."
DEV-MUC3-0045	TEGUCIGALPA, 26 JAN 89 -- ...WHICH HAS DISMAYED ALL HONDURAN PEOPLE. THE GOVERNMENT STRONGLY CONDEMNS THIS KIND OF ACTION--THE MURDER OF GENERAL GUSTAVO ALVAREZ MARTINEZ--WHICH WAS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED AND PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS, AND WHICH, I BELIEVE, DESERVES THE DENUNCIATION OF ALL HONDURANS. MR PRESIDENT, WILL THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES ADOPT ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES? YES, WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THAT SOON. I HAVE A MEETING SCHEDULED WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, WHICH WILL ALSO BE ATTENDED BY THE THREE PRESIDENTS OF THE STATE BRANCHES. I MEAN, THE WILL CHAIR THE MEETING, AND NATIONAL CONGRESS PRESIDENT CARLOS ARBIN MONTOYA AND SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT SALOMON JIMENEZ CASTRO WILL ALSO ATTEND. WE HAVE ALSO INVITED THE CANDIDATES OF THE TWO PARTIES TO THIS MEETING SINCE ONE OF THEM IS GOING TO BE THE NEXT HONDURAN PRESIDENT. WE PLAN TO ESTABLISH SOME GUIDELINE--SOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED--NOT JUST FOR THE REMAINDER OF OUR TERM BUT IN THE FUTURE AS WELL, BECAUSE WE SHOULD BE FARSIGHTED AND NOT JUST CONCENTRATE ON THE SHORT TERM, WHICH HAS BEEN VERY COMMON IN HONDURAS, WHERE WE LOOK AND FIND SOLUTIONS ONLY FOR THE PRESENT. WE SHOULD FIND SOLUTIONS JOINTLY IN THE LONG RUN, WHICH INCLUDES THE ISSUE OF VIOLENCE. WE BELIEVE IN A DEMOCRACY LIKE OURS, WHICH IS A VERY COMPLETE DEMOCRACY. IN OTHER WORDS, THERE ARE INTERNAL ELECTIONS FOR SELECTING CANDIDATES, WHERE CITIZENS ENJOY FULL RIGHTS, WHERE PARTIES AND PARTY LEADERS CONSULT WITH THE PEOPLE, WHERE WE HAVE TRUE, CLEAN, AND HONEST ELECTIONS, WHERE WE HAVE A NATIONAL ELECTORAL COMMISSION THAT IS NOT INFLUENCED BY NOR CAN IT BE INFLUENCED BY THE GOVERNMENT, AND WHERE THE STATE BRANCHES ARE TOTALLY INDEPENDENT. ALL OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS MAKE HONDURAS A DEMOCRACY, AND EVERY SECTOR OF HONDURAN SOCIETY SHOULD STRIVE TO STRENGTHEN THEM BY AVOIDING VIOLENCE AT ALL COSTS, OBEYING THE LAW, AND CONDEMNING AND ATTACKING EXTREME TERRORIST GROUPS REGARDLESS OF THEIR AFFILIATION, THUS ENABLING US TO CONSOLIDATE OUR DEMOCRACY AND REACH THE LEVEL OF POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT ATTAINED BY OTHER DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES. IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED WORLDWIDE THAT PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED THROUGH DEMOCRACY. THE FRG, THE MEDITERRANEAN COUNTRIES--ITALY, FRANCE, AND SPAIN--ARE EXAMPLES OF THIS, AND THERE IS THE CASE OF JAPAN, WHICH HAS A LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM AND HAS ACHIEVED EXTRAORDINARY LEVELS OF DEVELOPMENT. TAIWAN IS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE. AT THIS STAGE... YES, BUT THIS TAKES TIME. YES. AT THIS STAGE I BELIEVE THERE IS SUFFICIENT PROOF THAT THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM IS THE BEST MEANS OF ATTAINING HIGHER LEVELS OF DEVELOPMENT. THERE IS NO DOUBT IN ANYONE'S MIND ABOUT THAT, BUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THIS SYSTEM IS NOT ENOUGH. EACH ONE OF US, EACH SECTOR, MUST DO HIS PART TO MAKE IT WORK. WHEN I MENTION SECTORS, I AM REFERRING TO PRIVATE ENTERPRISE, WHICH MUST BE GENEROUS, EXHIBIT CONFIDENCE IN THE COUNTRY, AND SHOW MUCH INITIATIVE; TO ORGANIZED LABOR GROUPS, WHICH MUST FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHTS WITHOUT FOMENTING STRIKES AND OTHER DISORDERS, WHICH ARE SOMETIMES BROUGHT ABOUT ILLEGALLY INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE NORMAL LEGAL PROCEDURES; TO PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, WHICH ALSO HAVE AN ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY, BECAUSE THEIR MEMBERS MUST COMPLY WITH THEIR DUTIES; AND THE SAME GOES FOR GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS. IN OTHER WORDS, THIS WILL NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THIS OR THE NEXT GOVERNMENT ALONE. OUR GOVERNMENTS ARE TRANSITORY AND THEIR POWER IS RELATIVE. I HAVE SAID THIS MANY TIMES. THERE IS NO POINT IN LASHING OUT AT THE PRESIDENT, BECAUSE POWER IN HONDURAS IS RELATIVE AND CONDITIONAL. WHAT IS ESSENTIAL IS TO CONTRIBUTE POSITIVELY TOWARD HONDURAS' DEVELOPMENT. THIS SHOULD BE A RESPONSIBILITY NOT ONLY OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES, BUSINESSMEN, WORKERS, AND ORGANIZED PEASANTS, BUT ALL HONDURANS SHOULD CONTRIBUTE. THAT IS WHAT COUNTS. MR PRESIDENT, WHEN WILL THIS MEETING BE HELD AND WHAT IMMEDIATE MEASURES WILL YOU PROPOSE? THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO INVESTIGATE THE LATEST CRIME, WHICH WAS NOT AN EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE LIKE A ROBBERY OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE. THIS CRIME WAS CAREFULLY PLANNED. IT WAS A TERRORIST ACT PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS. MR PRESIDENT, SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT THE DEATH PENALTY MIGHT BE A WAY TO COPE WITH THE SITUATION. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS? I RECENTLY READ SOMETHING ABOUT THE DEATH PENALTY IN A MEXICAN MAGAZINE. THE DEATH PENALTY IS OPPOSED BY A MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE AND HAS BEEN ABOLISHED IN HONDURAS. I DO NOT THINK THIS IS THE SOLUTION HERE BECAUSE THE DEATH PENALTY HAS NOT SOLVED THE CRIME PROBLEM ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. FOR INSTANCE, THIS PENALTY EXISTS IN MANY U.S. STATES, BUT THIS HAS NOT DETERRED CRIMINALS FROM COMMITTING TERRIBLE CRIMES. PEOPLE HAVE LOST CONTROL. WHEN CRIMINALS HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THEIR FELLOW MAN, NOT EVEN THE DEATH PENALTY CAN STOP THEM. HOWEVER, THERE ARE CRIMES, SUCH AS DRUG TRAFFICKING, FOR WHICH NO BAIL SHOULD BE PERMITTED. I THINK A BILL THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE SHOULD BE PASSED BY THE CONGRESS. OF COURSE, IT WILL BE APPROVED BY THE PRESIDENT SO THOSE FOUND GUILTY OF THIS CRIME CANNOT BE BAILED OUT. IT IS NOT RIGHT FOR THE AUTHORITIES TO ARREST A DRUG TRAFFICKER ONLY TO SEE HIM RELEASED ON BAIL BY A JUDGE WHO HAS NO OTHER CHOICE THAN TO ABIDE BY THE LAW. MR PRESIDENT, THE FAR RIGHTIST GROUP AAA , THROUGH A LOCAL RADIO STATION, WARNED THAT THEY WILL TAKE REVENGE ON MAJOR COMMUNIST LEADERS, SUCH AS JORGE ARTURO REINA, RAMON CUSTODIO, AND OTHERS. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS? I AM ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO THIS TYPE OF REVENGE BECAUSE IT WOULD ONLY LEAD TO ESCALATED CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN GROUPS. I CONDEMN THIS ATTITUDE IN VIEW OF THE REGRETTABLE MURDER OF GENERAL GUSTAVO ALVAREZ MARTINEZ. AS FAR AS THE DEATH PENALTY GOES, IT WILL NOT BE A SOLUTION TO THE CRIME PROBLEM. MR PRESIDENT, CIVIC COMMITTEES HAVE TO BE ORGANIZED IN THE COUNTRY. I AGREE, BUT THESE COMMITTEES SHOULD BE CONTROLLED BY THE AUTHORITIES. A CIVIC COMMITTEE TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES IS ONE THING, BUT IT IS QUITE ANOTHER THING TO SUE THESE COMMITTEES TO PERFORM DUTIES THAT ARE ALREADY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF STATE AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE ARMED FORCES. WHEN WILL THE GOVERNMENT BRANCHES MEET? THEY WILL MEET WHEN I RETURN FROM CARACAS.
DEV-MUC3-0046	TEGUCIGALPA, 26 JAN 89 -- THE ANTICOMMUNIST ACTION ALLIANCE REPORTS THE FOLLOWING TO THE HONDURAN PEOPLE, IN PARTICULAR, AND TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN GENERAL: 1. DURING A MEETING TODAY, THE DEMOCRATIC PATRIOTIC COMMITTEES AND OUR ORGANIZATION'S DISCIPLINARY TRIBUNAL TRIED AND SENTENCED TO DEATH THE FOLLOWING TERRORISTS OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM: JORGE ARTURO REINA, JUAN ALMENDAREZ BONILLA, RAMON CUSTODIO LOPEZ, ANIBAL PUERTO, AND HECTOR HERNANDEZ. 2. THESE PEOPLE WILL BE EXECUTED BEGINNING ON THIS DATE FOR THE SAKE OF LOVE AND FREEDOM. DEATH TO COMMUNISM!
DEV-MUC3-0047	AYACUCHO, 25 SEP 88 -- ACCORDING TO MILITARY SOURCES AND PEOPLE WHO ARRIVED TODAY IN AYACUCHO FROM THE LA MAR AREA, 44 PEASANTS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN TWO TOWNSHIPS OF LA MAR PROVINCE, AYACUCHO DEPARTMENT. YESTERDAY A COLUMN OF SHINING PATH TERRORISTS ARRIVED IN THE VILLAGE OF CHINCHIPE, IN THE JUNGLE PROVINCE OF LA MAR, AND SHOT 16 PEASANTS WHO WERE MEMBERS OF THE PEASANT PATROLS THAT OPPOSE THE TERRORISTS. THE SHINING PATH GUERRILLAS, WHO BURNED MURDERED PEASANTS' HOUSES, CHARGED THEM WITH COLLABORATING WITH THE ARMY. THE TOWN OF CHINCHIPE IS 220 KM NORTH OF AYACUCHO. TRAVELLERS ARRIVING FROM LA MAR PROVINCE SAID THAT ON 23 SEPTEMBER 28 BODIES OF ALLEGED PEASANTS WERE FOUND NEAR THE TOWN OF CHULLAS. THE BODIES SHOWED SIGNS OF TORTURE AND BULLET WOUNDS BUT THE IDENTITY OF THE MURDERERS APPARENTLY COULD NOT BE DETERMINED.
DEV-MUC3-0048	BUENOS AIRES, 26 JAN 89 -- THE NEW SECOND IN COMMAND OF THE 3D INFANTRY REGIMENT BASED AT LA TABLADA, MAJOR HECTOR MUSIO, WILL BE INSTALLED THIS AFTERNOON. HE REPLACES MAJOR HORACIO FERNANDEZ CUTIELLO WHO WAS KILLED DURING THE ATTACK ON THE 3D REGIMENT ON 23 JANUARY. MUSIO WILL BE THE ACTING COMMANDING OFFICER BECAUSE COMMANDER JORGE SAMUDIO WAS INJURED ON 23 JANUARY WHILE HEADING A GROUP OF OFFICERS INCLUDING NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS WHO WERE REPELLING THE TERRORISTS' ATTACK FROM THE REAR OF THE REGIMENT GROUNDS.
DEV-MUC3-0049	LA PAZ, 24 DEC 88 -- ACCORDING TO A CLAIM MADE BY THE MINISTER OF INTERIOR, MIGRATION, AND JUSTICE, JUAN CARLOS DURAN, 1988 WAS A "POSITIVE YEAR," BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT MANAGED TO SCORE ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE ECONOMIC AREA AS WELL AS IN DEFENSE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM EXISTING IN BOLIVIA. THE MINISTER REMARKED: "I BELIEVE THAT IT WAS A YEAR OF FULL ACCOMPLISHMENT, A VERY POSITIVE AND VERY GOOD YEAR"; HE ADDED THAT THE MONTHS OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR REPRESENTED PROGRESS FOR THE GOVERNMENT IN STATE ADMINISTRATION TASKS. HE EXPLAINED THAT GREATER CONSOLIDATION WAS ACHIEVED IN THE ECONOMIC AREA, MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR THE EFFORTS INTENDED TO REINFORCE BOLIVIA'S POLITICAL SYSTEM TO BE WELL AIMED. HE CLAIMED THAT A SYSTEM SUCH AS THE ONE IN FORCE IN OUR NATION HAS ENABLED THE CITIZENS TO ENJOY "ABSOLUTE FREEDOM," SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN UNDERSCORED NOT ONLY IN OUR COUNTRY, BUT IN THE NATIONS OF THE ENTIRE WORLD AS WELL. HE NOTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT HAD TO RESORT TO ANY UNUSUAL ACTION TO DEFEND DEMOCRACY. HE RECALLED MARTIAL LAW HAD NOT BEEN ORDERED, ATTESTING TO PROGRESS IN THE NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS. HE COMMENTED: "BOLIVIA IS AN EXEMPLARY COUNTRY IN TERMS OF FREEDOM," STRESSING THE BENEFITS THIS NATION HAS EXPERIENCED BY HAVING A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM IN WHICH EVERYONE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISAGREE EVEN WITH THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. HE SAID THAT THE CITIZENS AS A WHOLE HAVE FOUND IT NECESSARY FOR RIGHTS TO BE RECOGNIZED AND OBLIGATIONS ACCEPTED. FOR THIS REASON, HE CLAIMED, THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE STABILITY IN THE VARIOUS FIELDS OF ACTIVITY, SOMETHING THAT WILL HAVE FAR MORE VISIBLE EFFECTS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. DRUG TRAFFICKING WITH REGARD TO THE BATTLE AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFIC, HE CITED THE WORK PERFORMED BY THE SPECIAL FORCES TO BATTLE DRUG TRAFFICKING WHICH, ACCORDING TO HIS ACCOUNT, DESTROYED HUNDRED OF COCAINE FACTORIES AND PROCESSING PITS, IN ADDITION TO CONFISCATING DRUGS AND ARRESTING PERSONS LINKED WITH THEIR PRODUCTION OR ILLICIT TRAFFICKING. HE DECLARED THAT, DESPITE ITS ECONOMIC AND TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS, BOLIVIA HAS MANAGED TO RESPOND TO THE INTERNATIONAL CONFIDENCE AND TO FOSTER A CONSCIOUSNESS AIMED AT IMPROVING THE METHODS FOR COMBATING DRUG TRAFFICKERS. ROBBERY THE MINISTER ANNOUNCED THAT THE SANTA CRUZ POLICE HAD MOBILIZED IN A "COMBING OPERATION," TO FIND THE PERPETRATORS OF THE ROBBERY OF A CAR ON THE TRACK OF THE EASTERN RAILROAD SYSTEM FROM WHICH 130,000 BOLIVIANOS, INTENDED TO PAY CHRISTMAS BONUSES, WAS STOLEN. HE SAID THAT THE ARMED FORCES AND POLICE WERE STILL COMPLYING WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO ERADICATE THE CRIME THAT HAS BEEN OCCURRING ON A LARGE SCALE DURING RECENT MONTHS IN THE CITY OF SANTA CRUZ, AND TO BENEFIT THE EASTERN POPULATION WITH PROTECTION. HE EXPLAINED THAT THE POLICE HAVE BEEN TAKING STATEMENTS FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE SEEN THE HOLDUP MEN AT CLOSE RANGE, SO AS TO CAPTURE THEM PROMPTLY.
DEV-MUC3-0050	SANTIAGO, 24 JAN 89 -- THE CHILEAN FOREIGN MINISTRY HAS CATEGORICALLY REJECTED THE U.S. DECISION TO CITE A TREATY SIGNED WITH CHILE IN 1914, TO TURN THE MURDER CASE OF FORMER CHILEAN FOREIGN MINISTER ORLANDO LETELIER OVER TO AN INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF JURISTS. THIS STATEMENT WAS MADE BY FOREIGN MINISTER HERNAN FELIPE ERRAZURIZ, WHO ADDED THAT THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT IS HANDLING THE SITUATION IN A SERIOUS AND PROFESSIONAL MANNER. YES, ON 12 JANUARY WE RECEIVED A DIPLOMATIC NOTE WHICH WE ARE NOW STUDYING. WE CATEGORICALLY REJECT THE IMPLICIT PRESSURE ON SOMETHING WE ARE HANDLING IN A SERIOUS AND PROFESSIONAL MANNER. WE HAVE GRANTED ALL POSSIBLE COOPERATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR RIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL LAW. IN VIEW OF THIS SITUATION, THE FOREIGN MINISTRY ISSUED AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT WHICH SAYS THAT THE 1914 TREATY IS BEING STUDIED TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT IT IS APPLICABLE. THE STATEMENT ADDS THAT THE TERMS USED BY THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN LAST MONDAY IN REFERRING TO THIS MATTER REPRESENT A DISTORTED AND PARTIAL VIEW, REFLECTING THE DESIRE TO IMPOSE A POSITION DISREGARDING INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE DOMESTIC LAWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES. THE FOREIGN MINISTRY STATEMENT CONCLUDES BY SAYING THAT THE CHILEAN COURTS ARE PROCESSING A ROGATORY LETTER SUBMITTED THROUGH NORMAL DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS, HAVING TO DO WITH THE PROCEEDINGS BEING CARRIED OUT IN THE UNITED STATES ON THIS CRIMINAL CASE.

DEV-MUC3-0053	BOGOTA, 23 JAN 89 -- PATRIOTIC UNION PRESIDENT BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA TODAY REVEALED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WARNED HIM OF A PLOT TO MURDER HIM AT EL DORADO AIRPORT UPON HIS RETURN FROM CUBA. AFTER RETURNING HOME FROM THE AIRPORT ON SATURDAY NIGHT, BERNARDO JARAMILLO RECEIVED ANOTHER DEATH THREAT OVER THE TELEPHONE. TODAY, FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE TO SUBSTANTIATE THE THREAT, THE AUTHORITIES STEPPED UP SECURITY MEASURES FOR JARAMILLO. AN ARMORED VEHICLE, 2 STATION WAGONS, 2 MOTORCYCLES, AND 15 MEN, ARMED TO THE TEETH AND NOT MORE THAN 30 YEARS OLD, HAVE BECOME JARAMILLO'S GUARDIAN ANGELS. ARE YOU AFRAID? I HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT ONLY BAD PEOPLE ARE AFRAID. HOWEVER, I WILL TELL YOU QUITE HONESTLY THAT I WOULD BE MORE AFRAID IF I HAD DECIDED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY. I AM DETERMINED TO REMAIN IN COLOMBIA AND TO CONTINUE WORKING FOR DEMOCRACY AND PEACE. DO YOU FEEL THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS GIVING YOU ENOUGH PROTECTION? ONE THING IS THE DIRECT PROTECTION EFFICIENTLY PROVIDED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY, AND ANOTHER THING IS THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY FOR ELIMINATING THESE PROBLEMS. I DO NOT BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY FOR DISMANTLING THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS IS APPROPRIATE. WHEN YOU LEAVE YOUR HOME, DO YOU FEEL IT IS YOUR LAST DAY? I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AN OPTIMIST; I ALSO BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL DIE WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT IT. WHEN I WALK OUT OF MY HOME, I TAKE ALL THE NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS. JARAMILLO SAID HIS TWO SONS, WHO DO NOT LIVE IN BOGOTA, CALLED TO SAY THEY WANTED TO SEE HIM. JARAMILLO TOLD THEM TO STAY AWAY; HE FEARS THAT A SURPRISE ATTACK CAN HAPPEN AT ANY TIME AND THAT HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS MAY BECOME THE VICTIMS OF THIS NEVER-ENDING WAR.

DEV-MUC3-0061	SAN SALVADOR, 6 FEB 89 -- ON A NATIONAL RADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK LAST NIGHT, THE GOVERNMENT REVEALED THE RESULTS OF A NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS ON THE MURDER OF MSGR ARNULFO ROMERO; HOWEVER, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID AT NOON TODAY ONLY THE FOURTH CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE CAN DETERMINE WHETHER THE EVIDENCE AGAINST ANY PERSON IS LEGAL: SINCE I DO NOT KNOW THEIR CONTENT, I CANNOT GIVE AN OPINION ON THE MATTER. HOWEVER, IF FROM THOSE RECORDS OR THE VIDEO ONE CAN DETERMINE THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO SOLVE THE CRIME COMMITTED AGAINST MSGR ROMERO, I WILL UNQUESTIONABLY REQUEST THAT EVIDENCE AND SUBMIT IT IMMEDIATELY TO THE FOURTH CRIMINAL COURT. I BELIEVE EVIDENCE SHOULD NOT BE USED TO SPECULATE OR SHOULD NOT BE PUBLICLY PROMOTED. IF PERTINENT EVIDENCE EXISTS, IT MUST BE SUBMITTED TO THE CORRESPONDING JUDGE, WHO IS THE EXCLUSIVE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO DEAL WITH IT AND, AFTER AN EXHAUSTIVE ANALYSIS, DETERMINE THE VALIDITY OF THE EVIDENCE. NEVERTHELESS, MSGR ROMERO'S CASE HAS BEGUN TO HAVE THE ELEMENTS IT HAD LACKED FOR MORE THAN 8 YEARS. THE LEGAL EVIDENCE MUST CONTAIN A SERIES OF CONDITIONS, AND ONLY THE JUDGE CAN DETERMINE WHETHER THEY HAVE VALUE OR NOT. THE VIDEO FOR EXAMPLE IS NOT EVIDENCE. THE CONTENTS OF THE VIDEO MUST BE REAFFIRMED BY THE PERSONS WHO IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER PARTICIPATED IN THE PREPARATION, AND THE ACCURACY OF THE CONTENTS NARRATED IN THAT VIDEO MUST BE LEGALLY DETERMINED. GARCIA ALVARADO ADDED THAT THE FOURTH CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE DECIDED A FEW HOURS AGO TO SUMMON FORMER ATTORNEY ROBERTO GIRON FLORES AND THE OFFICIALS JULIO ALFREDO SAMAYOA AND GERARDO LE CHEVALIER TO GIVE THE EVIDENCE THEY CLAIM TO HAVE ON THE CASE. BECAUSE THEY ARE OFFICIALS, THE LATTER TWO MUST MAKE SWORN STATEMENTS. THE JUDGE IN CHARGE OF THE CASE HAS ISSUED RESOLUTIONS ORDERING THE SUMMONS OF IVON FLORES AND SWORN STATEMENTS FROM THE TWO OFFICIALS MENTIONED. THESE NEW RESOLUTIONS OF THE FOURTH CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE ON MSGR ROMERO'S CASE WERE ISSUED AT THE REQUEST OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, WHICH DEMONSTRATES, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID, THAT HE IS NOT AN UNDERTAKER OF TRIALS, MUCH LESS OF PEOPLE. VICE PRESIDENT ANTONIO CASTILLO CLARAMOUNT SAID THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE HAS THE MORAL OBLIGATION TO PUNISH THE MURDERERS OF MSGR ROMERO, INCLUDING MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON. THE VICE PRESIDENT ALSO INSISTED THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO SEE THAT THOSE GUILTY OF THE MURDER OF MSGR ROMERO BE PUNISHED. HOWEVER, HE STRESSED THE SUPREME COURT MUST ACT. HE SAID THE INVESTIGATION MUST CONTINUE AND GATHER ALL THE EVIDENCE TO SOLVE THIS CASE, WHICH OCCURRED IN MARCH 1980.
DEV-MUC3-0062	SAN SALVADOR, 6 FEB 89 -- JUSTICE MINISTER JULIO ALFREDO SAMAYOA SAID TODAY ALL THE EVIDENCE GATHERED BY THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMISSION DEMONSTRATES THAT DR ANTONIO REGALADO WAS THE PERPETRATOR OF THE MURDER OF MSGR ROMERO. IN HIS CAPACITY AS CHAIRMAN OF THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMISSION, DR JULIO ALFREDO SAMAYOA REPORTED TODAY IN DETAIL ON THE MURDER OF MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO. DR SAMAYOA SAID TO CLARIFY THE CASE, THE COMMISSION HAS CONDUCTED 238 MEETINGS, OVER 100 INQUIRIES, AND 21 DEPOSITIONS. HE ADDED THAT THE INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT UNDER THE NAME OF "OPERATION PINEAPPLE" AND THAT IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON WAS THE MASTERMIND AND DR ANTONIO REGALADO WAS THE PERPETRATOR. THERE IS NO DOUBT. ALL THE INVESTIGATIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE COMMISSION POINT TO MAJ ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON AS THE MASTERMIND. THIS HAS TO BE PROVEN IN COURT. HOWEVER, HE HAS PARLIAMENTARY IMMUNITY; HE CANNOT BE BROUGHT TO COURT. THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE HAS THE MAJORITY IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, AND ARENA IS NOT GOING TO PERMIT A DECLARATION THAT WILL BRING HIS CASE TO COURT. DR SAMAYOA ALSO SAID HE IS WILLING TO PRESENT ALL THE EVIDENCE HE HAS ON THE CASE. HOWEVER, HE SAID HE DID NOT TRUST THE BEHAVIOR OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE REPUBLIC: WE WILL PRESENT THE EVIDENCE. I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO BE SORRY THEY MADE THAT REQUEST, BECAUSE MANY PERSONS ARE INVOLVED. SINCE THEIR PARTICIPATION HAS NOT YET BEEN PROVEN, THESE NAMES HAVE NOT YET BEEN RELEASED. HOWEVER, WHEN WE PRESENT THE ENTIRE DOSSIER TO THE COURTS, THESE NAMES ARE GOING TO COME UP. THEN SOME WILL JUDGE AND DECIDE IF THEY PARTICIPATED OR NOT. BUT THEIR NAMES ARE THERE, AS ARE THEIR ACTIVITIES AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS TO THE DEATH SQUADS. MANY PERSONS WHO ARE MENTIONED ARE APPARENTLY RESPECTABLE, AND I MEAN RESPECTABLE IN QUOTES. THE ASSASSINATION OF MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO TOOK PLACE ON 24 MARCH 1980; ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL, THE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE TAKEN 9 YEARS BECAUSE MANY PERSONS CONSIDERED KEY WITNESSES HAVE DIED SINCE THE TIME OF THE MURDER. HOWEVER, HE ADDED, WITH THE COOPERATION OF THE FBI AS WELL AS SOME CENTRAL AMERICAN INVESTIGATION ORGANIZATIONS, THE CASE HAS BEEN CLARIFIED, WHICH MIGHT LEAD TO THE IMPRISONMENT OF MAJ D'AUBUISSON ONCE HE LOSES HIS PARLIAMENTARY IMMUNITY.

CRISTIANI, A WEALTHY BUSINESSMAN, ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT IF HE WINS THE ELECTIONS HE WILL PUT AN END TO THE NATIONALIZATION OF THE BANKING SECTOR AND FOREIGN TRADE ACTIVITIES, THE MAIN PILLARS OF A PLAN WHOSE IMPLEMENTATION BEGAN AFTER THE COUNTRY'S 1979 COUP D'ETAT.

THE FMLN HAS ANNOUNCED IT WILL INTENSIFY ITS "INSURRECTIONAL ACTIONS" THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, WHICH COULD AFFECT THE NATION'S ELECTRICAL AND TELEPHONE SYSTEMS ON ELECTION DAY. THE GUERRILLAS ARE OPPOSED TO THE ELECTIONS BECAUSE THEY FEEL THEY ARE "PART OF THE COUNTERINSURGENCY PLAN AND A MEANS OF LEGITIMIZING THE CONTINUATION OF WAR, HUNGER, AND POVERTY." "THOSE WHO COOPERATE WITH THE ELECTORAL FARCE WILL BE THROWN OUT OF THEIR HOMES, EXECUTED, AND THEIR PROPERTIES WILL BE SABOTAGED BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER THE ELECTIONS," THE REBELS SAID. THE GUERRILLAS SENT MESSAGES ON SATURDAY NIGHT TO THE MAYORS AND MUNICIPAL COUNCILS OF EIGHT TOWNS IN LA UNION DEPARTMENT, DEMANDING THAT THEY RESIGN OR THE FMLN WILL "BRING TO BEAR" AGAINST THEM "THE ENTIRE WEIGHT OF POPULAR JUSTICE."
DEV-MUC3-0072	SAN SALVADOR, 7 FEB 89 -- MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON YESTERDAY STATED: "I HAVE WITHSTOOD THE LOWEST SLANDER FOR 8 YEARS. GOD ALMIGHTY AND MY CONSCIENCE KNOW I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT REPUDIATED MURDER. "EVERY TIME THERE ARE ELECTIONS, WE HEAR THE SAME RUMORS THAT THERE IS EVIDENCE ABOUT MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO'S CASE AND THAT IT WILL BE PRESENTED. THUS, A GREAT SHOW IS PRESENTED, BUT ONCE THE ELECTIONS ARE OVER NO ONE REMEMBERS THAT MARTYR OF THE CHURCH. "DUARTE'S GOVERNMENT, SUPPORTED BY THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY, PDC, RESORTS TO VILE DEFAMATION, SLANDER, AND LIES AGAINST ITS POLITICAL OPPONENTS BECAUSE IT CANNOT HIDE ITS CORRUPTION." THIS STATEMENT WAS ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE, ARENA, DEPUTY TO REJECT THE ANNOUNCEMENT ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT, "IN A NATIONAL RADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK," THAT IMPLICATED D'AUBUISSON "IN MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO'S DEATH." "I AM SORRY I DID NOT SEE THE BROADCAST, BUT OTHERS HAVE COMMENTED ON IT. I CAN VERY WELL IMAGINE ALL THE DESPICABLE THINGS THAT WERE IRRESPONSIBLY SAID TO TWIST THE TRUTH SO THE PDC COULD AGAIN USE MSGR ROMERO'S DEATH AS AN ELECTION ISSUE. IT IS ALL PART OF THE PDC'S PROPAGANDA, BUT THE TRUTH WILL ALWAYS PREVAIL," D'AUBUISSON SAID. "THE MOST REPREHENSIBLE THING IS THAT THE DUARTE ADMINISTRATION USES RADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS, OPENLY ABUSING ITS AUTHORITY, TO SLANDER ME--SIMPLY BECAUSE I AM THE PDC'S POLITICAL ADVERSARY, AND BECAUSE THE PDC HAS NO EXCUSE TO JUSTIFY THE CRISIS THAT HAS BEEN CAUSED BY ITS CORRUPTION." D'AUBUISSON ADDED: THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS' "LIE" IS AIMED AT DECEIVING SALVADORAN CATHOLICS. THAT IS DESPICABLE AND UNSPEAKABLE, BECAUSE THEY ARE INSULTING MSGR ROMERO'S MEMORY. THE PDC HAS GOVERNED THE COUNTRY FOR 8 YEARS. THE PDC CONTROLLED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WHEN MSGR ROMERO WAS KILLED. THE CRUCIAL QUESTION IS: WHY WEREN'T THE NECESSARY MEASURES TAKEN TO CLARIFY THE CASE AT THE TIME? WHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT CLAIM IT HAS THE EVIDENCE YET FAILS TO PRESENT IT? AH, BECAUSE THIS WOULD END THE GOVERNMENT'S POLITICAL GAME OF SAYING THAT IT IS INVESTIGATING MSGR ROMERO'S DEATH! THIS ENTIRE ATTITUDE IS REPREHENSIBLE, D'AUBUISSON STATED. HE ASSERTED: I AM AWARE OF THE PDC'S INCREDIBLE PLOT TO SLANDER ME, BUT THE PDC ONLY SAYS WHAT IS CONVENIENT. IT IS A DIRTY GAME BUT GOD IS MY WITNESS; MY CONSCIENCE IS CLEAR. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE KNOW MY GREAT CRIME HAS BEEN TO STRUGGLE AGAINST THE MARXIST-LENINISTS. THE PDC CANNOT FORGIVE ME FOR THIS BECAUSE THEY ARE CLOSELY LINKED WITH THOSE WHO "ARE GREEN ON THE OUTSIDE BUT RED ON THE INSIDE." HOWEVER, I WILL CONTINUE STRUGGLING LIKE A GOOD SALVADORAN SO THE "TURNCOATS" DO NOT BETRAY US, AS WAS THE CASE IN NICARAGUA, MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON ARRIETA EMPHASIZED.
DEV-MUC3-0073	NO CITY , 5 FEB 89 -- RADIO FARABUNDO MARTI IN SPANISH TO EL SALVADOR AT 2200 GMT ON 5 FEBRUARY BROADCASTS APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES OF BATTLE REPORTS COVERING THE PERIOD 29 JANUARY TO 4 FEBRUARY. ACCORDING TO THE STATION, DURING THIS PERIOD GOVERNMENT FORCES SUSTAINED 109 CASUALTIES, BROKEN DOWN AS FOLLOWS: 64 AS THE RESULT OF ATTACKS OR COMBAT, 37 IN AMBUSHES, AND 8 AS THE RESULT OF GOVERNMENT TROOPS STEPPING ON MINES. THE CASUALTIES REPORTEDLY INCLUDED A SERGEANT, TWO CORPORALS, AND A CIVILIAN DEFENSE COMMANDER. THE REPORT ADDS THAT ON 29 AND 30 JANUARY, THE FMLN CARRIED OUT THE SUBREGIONAL MANEUVER "OUR PEOPLE FIGHT BRAVELY FOR PEACE AND LIBERTY." THE FMLN REPORTEDLY ATTACKED LA LAGUNA, CONCEPCION QUZALTEPEQUE, LA PALMA, SAN IGNACIO, SAN MIGUEL DE MERCEDES, AND EL CHIQUE, ALL IN CHALATENANGO, AND INFLICTED 55 CASUALTIES ON THE ENEMY, 45 OF WHICH WERE INFLICTED ON THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE'S AZMITIA BATTALION. THE STATION REPORTS THAT ON 30 JANUARY, GUERRILLA FORCES OCCUPIED YAMABAL AND SENSENBRA IN MORAZAN, WHERE MILITARY DETACHMENT NO 4'S CACAGUATIQUE BATTALION TROOPS FLED IN DISARRAY. THE STATION ADDS: "ANOTHER IMPORTANT ACTION THIS WEEK RESULTED IN 20 CASUALTIES INFLICTED ON THE NATIONAL GUARD DURING A 29 JANUARY AMBUSH ON THE ILOBASCO-SAN ISIDRO HIGHWAY, CABANAS DEPARTMENT. IN ADDITION, CLANDESTINE MILITIAS AMBUSHED 2D INFANTRY BRIGADE TROOPS ON THE SANTA ANA-SAN SALVADOR FREEWAY, NEAR EL BEJUCO. THIS ACTION RESULTED IN NINE GOVERNMENT CASUALTIES, COUNTING DEAD AND WOUNDED." THE STATION REPORTS IN CONCLUSION THAT THE FMLN LAUNCHED FIVE AMBUSHES THIS WEEK "WITH THE OUTSTANDING PARTICIPATION OF CLANDESTINE MILITIAS."
DEV-MUC3-0074	CLANDESTINE, 13 MAR 89 -- ATTENTION, MUCH ATTENTION: THE FOLLOWING IS A CALL TO THOSE WHO ARE HELPING TO ORGANIZE THE ELECTIONS. MUCH ATTENTION: WE CALL ON ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE HELPING TO ORGANIZE THE ELECTIONS. WE DEMAND THAT THEY PUBLICLY RESIGN FROM THEIR POSTS. WE REPEAT: WE CALL ON ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE HELPING TO ORGANIZE THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS AND DEMAND THAT THEY PUBLICLY RESIGN. THE 19 MARCH ELECTION BEING ORGANIZED BY THE PDC AND ARENA IS PART OF THE MILITARY COUNTERINSURGENCY PLAN AIMED AT LEGITIMIZING REPRESSION, THE BOMBING OF CIVILIANS, AND THE HUNGER AND POVERTY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. IN LIGHT OF THE ABOVE, THESE PEOPLE MUST IMMEDIATELY RESIGN. AFTER THEY HAVE DONE THIS, THEY WILL NO LONGER BE CONSIDERED BY OUR PEOPLE AS BEING PART OF THE MILITARY COUNTERINSURGENCY PLAN AND THEY WILL BE ABLE TO LIVE IN THEIR HOMES WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS. ARENA AND THE PDC REFUSED TO ACCEPT OUR PEACE PROPOSAL TO MAKE THE ELECTIONS A TOOL FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE WAR. THEREFORE, THE FEELING OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR PEOPLE IS ONE OF REJECTION OF THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS. THIS FEELING REQUIRES THAT EVERYONE INVOLVED IN ORGANIZING THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS PUBLICLY RESIGN AND JOIN THE PEOPLE IN THEIR SEARCH FOR PEACE THROUGH DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION AND IN DEFEATING THE ELECTORAL FARCE AIMED AT PERPETUATING THE WAR.
DEV-MUC3-0075	TEGUCIGALPA, 7 FEB -- A BOMB BLAST DAMAGED A TELEPHONE OFFICE TODAY IN THE NORTHERN CITY OF SAN PEDRO SULA. A LEFTIST GROUP, WHICH CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR AN ATTACK ON A U.S. MILITARY CONVOY LAST WEEK CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ATTACK. THE BOMB, MADE UP OF DYNAMITE AND A FUSE, EXPLODED JUST BEFORE DAWN IN THE HONDUTEL OFFICE IN SAN PEDRO SULA, 190 KM NORTH OF THIS CAPITAL. THE EXPLOSION DAMAGED FURNITURE, FOUR TELEPHONES, AND SHATTERED WINDOWS, BUT NOBODY WAS INJURED. LEAFLETS FOUND IN THE RUBBLE STATED THAT A LEFTIST GROUP WAS RESPONSIBLE BOTH FOR THE BOMB AS WELL AS THE ATTACK ON A U.S. MILITARY CONVOY LAST WEEK IN THE HONDURAN NORTHERN MOUNTAIN REGION. ALTHOUGH NO CASUALTIES WERE REPORTED, ONE OF THE VEHICLES IN THE U.S. CONVOY WAS HIT BY TWO BULLETS. UNTIL TODAY NOBODY HAD CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THAT ATTACK. "THE JACOBO CARCOMO COMMAND OF THE MORAZANIST PATRIOTIC FRONT ATTACKED A U.S. CONVOY WITH M-16 RIFLE-FIRE," THE LEAFLETS READ. CARCOMO WAS A HONDURAN LEFT-WING AUTHOR AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 20TH CENTURY. THE FPM, NAMED AFTER A CENTRAL AMERICAN LEADER OF THE LAST CENTURY, HAS CLAIMED CREDIT FOR SEVERAL GUERRILLA ATTACKS IN THE PAST. HONDURAS HAS BEEN GRIPPED BY A WAVE OF VIOLENCE THIS YEAR, INCLUDING THE ASSASSINATIONS OF A FORMER ARMED FORCES COMMANDER, A COMMANDER OF THE ANTI-SANDINIST REBELS , AND A LAWYER OF AN ALLEGED DRUG TRAFFICKING TSAR. PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA HAS CALLED FOR NATIONAL DIALOGUE STARTING THIS WEEK WITH THE GOVERNMENT, THE OPPOSITION PARTIES, LABOR UNIONS, BUSINESSMEN, AND OTHER GROUPS TO TRY TO CURB THE SUDDEN SURGE OF VIOLENCE. HONDURAS, A CLOSE U.S. ALLY, HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN A PEACEFUL COUNTRY IN A REGION STRICKEN BY INTERNAL CONFLICTS.
DEV-MUC3-0076	TEGUCIGALPA, 7 FEB 89 -- THE CINCHONERO POPULAR LIBERATION MOVEMENT, WHICH ON 25 JANUARY CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR KILLING FORMER HONDURAN ARMED FORCES CHIEF GENERAL GUSTAVO ALVAREZ, CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY TODAY FOR DETONATING A BOMB AT TELEPHONE COMPANY OFFICES IN SAN PEDRO SULA, NORTHERN HONDURAS. THE BOMB CAUSED NO CASUALTIES BUT DESTROYED AT LEAST SIX TELEPHONE BOOTHS, OFFICE EQUIPMENT AND MATERIAL, WALLS, WINDOWS, AND BLINDS IN ONE OF THE ADMINISTRATION OFFICES OF THE HONDURAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENTERPRISE, . DAMAGE WAS ESTIMATED AT $25,000 ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY FIGURES GIVEN BY A HONDUTEL SPOKESMAN. A "CINCHONEROS" SPOKESMAN WHO CALLED TWO RADIO STATIONS DID NOT GIVE DETAILS OF THE ATTACK, BUT SAID HE WOULD GIVE MORE INFORMATION LATER. POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING THE KILLING OF ALVAREZ ON 25 JANUARY AND TODAY'S ATTACK IN SAN PEDRO SULA, 240 KM NORTH OF TEGUCIGALPA.
DEV-MUC3-0077	BOGOTA, 7 FEB 89 -- COLOMBIAN INDUSTRIALIST NORMAL ECHEVARRIA AND U.S. BUSINESSMAN MICHAEL REYFF, KIDNAPPED 11 DAYS AGO IN MEDELLIN, WERE RESCUED TODAY. THE POLICE OPERATION TOOK PLACE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT'S CAPITAL. NO RANSOM WAS PAID. TWO OF THE KIDNAPPERS WERE KILLED, BUT THE OTHERS MANAGED TO ESCAPE. NEVERTHELESS, THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT COULD LEAD TO THEIR ARREST. COLONEL OTALORA, ASSISTANT COMMANDER OF THE MEDELLIN METROPOLITAN POLICE, HOW WERE NORMAL ECHEVARRIA AND U.S. CITIZEN MICHAEL REYFF RESCUED? AT 1700, MEDELLIN METROPOLITAN POLICE MEMBERS WERE ABLE TO RESCUE NORMAL ECHEVARRIA AND MICHAEL REYFF; THEY ARE SAFE AND SOUND. ONCE AGAIN WE THANK THE PEOPLE FOR THEIR TIMELY COOPERATION. LOCAL BUSINESSMEN LENT US THEIR HELICOPTERS TO SEARCH FOR AND ARREST THE KIDNAPPERS. UNFORTUNATELY IT QUICKLY BECAME DARK AND WE COULD NOT LOCATE THE KIDNAPPERS. HOWEVER, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THEM AND HOPE TO ARREST THEM IN A FEW HOURS. WHAT IS THE CONDITION OF THE TWO HOSTAGES? NORMAL ECHEVARRIA IS PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT. HE WILL PROBABLY MEET WITH YOU IN A FEW MINUTES. HE IS VERY HAPPY TO SEE HIS FAMILY. WE ARE PLEASED WITH THE POSITIVE RESULTS OF THIS OPERATION, AND THE NATIONAL POLICE FEEL PROUD. THE PEOPLE OF ANTIOQUIA HAVE BEEN BROUGHT CLOSER TO THEIR POLICE. WAS IT NECESSARY TO PAY A RANSOM? HAD THE FAMILY BEEN ASKED TO PAY A RANSOM? NO, NO RANSOM WAS PAID. MR ECHEVARRIA WILL TELL YOU THAT LATER. THEY ARE PERFECTLY SAFE AND SOUND. WHERE WERE THEY KEPT? CAN YOU DESCRIBE IT? NO, I CANNOT GIVE YOU DETAILS RIGHT NOW. WE WILL PROBABLY ISSUE THAT INFORMATION LATER.
DEV-MUC3-0078	SAN SALVADOR, 8 FEB 89 -- TWO VEHICLES WERE DESTROYED AND AN UNIDENTIFIED OFFICE OF THE AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK MINISTRY WAS HEAVILY DAMAGED FOLLOWING THE EXPLOSION OF TWO BOMBS YESTERDAY AFTERNOON. THE NATIONAL FIRE DEPARTMENT REPORTED THAT FOLLOWING THE EXPLOSIONS AT 1830, A FIRE ERUPTED THAT PARTIALLY DESTROYED AN UNIDENTIFIED OFFICE IN THE AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK MINISTRY BUILDING. IT WAS REPORTED THAT TWO VEHICLES IN THE AREA WHERE THE BOMBS WERE DETONATED WERE DESTROYED AND SEVERAL HOUSES IN THE AREA WERE DAMAGED. THE DAMAGED OFFICES ARE LOCATED AT 123 A AVENUE IN THE SAN JOSE NEIGHBORHOOD IN THE WESTERN SECTION OF SAN SALVADOR. FORTUNATELY, THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS INCIDENT, FOR WHICH THE FMLN GUERRILLAS ARE BEING HELD RESPONSIBLE.
DEV-MUC3-0079	TEGUCIGALPA, 8 FEB 89 -- THE NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTRY HAS DENIED THE CHARGES THAT THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT HAS LEVELED AGAINST THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA REGARDING THE 7 JANUARY ASSASSINATION IN TEGUCIGALPA OF MANUEL RUGAMA, KNOWN AS COMMANDER AURELIANO, THE SECOND IN COMMAND OF THE COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES IN HONDURAS. HONDURAN NATIONAL POLICE ON MONDAY PRESENTED TO THE PRESS HONDURAN JUAN BAUTISTA NUNEZ AMADOR AND NICARAGUAN LUIS FERNANDO ORDONEZ REYES, WHO TOLD REPORTERS THAT COMMANDER AURELIANO WAS ASSASSINATED ON ORDERS FROM JOSE DE JESUS PENA, THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY CHIEF OF SECURITY. MERCEDES BORGE, PRESS DIRECTOR AT THE NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTRY, SAID THERE IS NO JOSE DE JESUS PENA EMPLOYED AT THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA AND THAT AURELIANO'S ASSASSINATION WAS PERPETRATED BY THREE INDIVIDUALS AND NOT TWO, AS THE HONDURAN POLICE CLAIM. BORGE SAID THAT WHILE NICARAGUA MAKES SERIOUS AND FORMAL PROPOSALS TO ADVANCE PEACE EFFORTS, IT IS WORRISOME THAT HONDURAN MILITARY PERSONNEL ARE CREATING SITUATIONS THAT COULD UNLEASH CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN TWO ATTACKS ON THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA, BORGE SAID. SHE ADDED THAT THE HONDURAN POLICE REPORT CONFLICTS WITH THE AUTOPSY REPORT, BECAUSE IN HIS STATEMENT, NUNEZ AMADOR REFERRED TO ONLY A .38-CALIBER REVOLVER AND A .45-CALIBER PISTOL, WHICH WERE NOT FOUND ON RUGAMA'S BODY OR IN HIS VEHICLE.
DEV-MUC3-0080	BUENOS AIRES, 7 FEB 89 -- BUENOS AIRES POLICE CHIEF WALTER JURADO HAS CONFIRMED THAT MILITARY PERSONNEL OF THE VILLA MARTELLI 601ST REGIMENT THIS MORNING HEARD SOME SHOTS NEAR THE REGIMENT. HE DENIED, HOWEVER, THAT THE SHOOTING OCCURRED OUTSIDE THE LA TABLADA REGIMENT, AS HAS BEEN REPORTED. THE ARMY GENERAL STAFF HAS DENIED REPORTS THAT A MILITARY UNIT IN LA TABLADA OR VILLA MARTELLI WAS ATTACKED THIS MORNING, ALTHOUGH HE ADMITTED THAT TROOPS OF THE 601ST BATTALLION IN VILLA MARTELLI HEARD TWO SHOTS, BUT THAT NO STRANGE MOVEMENT HAS BEEN OBSERVED.
DEV-MUC3-0081	SANTIAGO, 8 FEB 89 -- THE BODY OF LIEUTENANT JOSE LUIS CANALES WAS REMOVED SHORTLY AFTER 1400 THIS AFTERNOON. HE WAS MURDERED BY FOUR UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE ON A SOCCER FIELD AT CARAMPANGUE AND ALBORADA STREETS, IN THE SANTIAGO NEIGHBORHOOD OF QUILCURA. THE MURDERERS ARE STILL AT LARGE. THE PROSECUTOR OF THE 5TH MILITARY COURT, RODRIGO SANDOVAL, WAS AT THE SCENE. HE WILL INVESTIGATE THIS ATTACK, IN WHICH A 2D CORPORAL OF THE CARABINEROS WAS ALSO KILLED. CARABINEROS HAVE REPORTED THAT THE VEHICLE USED BY THE MURDERERS TO ESCAPE WAS FOUND AT 82 OR 81 BARROS LUCO STREET, IN LA CISTERNA NEIGHBORHOOD. EYEWITNESSES REPORTED THAT THREE MEN AND A DARK-HAIRED GIRL, WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE ATTACK GOT OUT OF THE CAR, A WHITE HONDA ACCORD. THE UNIFORMED POLICE REPORTED THAT AFTER FINDING THE CAR, THEY RAIDED A HOUSE THAT TURNED OUT TO BE A HIDEOUT OF THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT. THE HOUSE IS AT 9224 BENAVENTE STREET, IN THE LA BANDERA NEIGHBORHOOD. ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, MANY SUBVERSIVE DOCUMENTS WERE FOUND IN THE HOUSE.
DEV-MUC3-0082	BOGOTA, 8 FEB 89 -- PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO RESHUFFLED HIS CABINET TODAY, APPOINTING FIVE NEW MINISTERS AND RECONFIRMING EIGHT FOR THE FINAL PHASE OF HIS TERM, ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL DECREE. THE REORGANIZATION OCCURRED AFTER THE MINISTERS PRESENTED A PROTOCOL RESIGNATION TO ALLOW THE PRESIDENT TO APPOINT NEW MINISTERS; SOME OF THEM DID NOT WANT TO BE POLITICALLY DISQUALIFIED FROM RUNNING FOR A SEAT IN CONGRESS IN THE 1990 ELECTIONS. THIS HAS BEEN THE THIRD IMPORTANT CABINET RESHUFFLE SINCE BARCO TOOK OFFICE IN AUGUST 1986. THE FIVE NEW CABINET MINISTERS INCLUDE TWO WOMEN WHO WILL HOLD THE POSTS OF PUBLIC WORKS AND LABOR MINISTERS. THE OTHERS WHO WILL JOIN THE CABINET WERE APPOINTED TO THE GOVERNMENT, COMMUNICATIONS, AND HEALTH MINISTRIES. THE OUTGOING MINISTERS STATED IN THEIR PROTOCOL LETTER OF RESIGNATION THAT A CABINET RESHUFFLE IS FUNDAMENTAL TO ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO ACHIEVE ITS GOALS IN THE FINAL STAGE OF PRESIDENT BARCO'S ADMINISTRATION. "WE HAVE SERVED IN A A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT PERIOD OF NATIONAL LIFE, CHARACTERIZED BY SITUATIONS OF CRIMINALITY AND TERRORISM," THE RESIGNATION LETTER STATED. THE LETTER ADDED THAT THE RESIGNATION RESULTED FROM SOME OF THE MINISTERS' NOT WANTING TO BE POLITICALLY DISQUALIFIED FROM RUNNING FOR PUBLIC POSTS. COLOMBIAN LAW DEMANDS THAT THOSE ASPIRING TO PUBLIC POSTS MUST NOT HAVE SERVED AS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WITHIN THE LAST 12 MONTHS.
DEV-MUC3-0083	LIMA, 6 FEB 89 -- ...TO AN ARRESTED LEADER OF THE TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT MEAN THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS ENGAGED IN A DIALOGUE WITH THAT GROUP? THINGS SHOULD BE PROPERLY CLARIFIED BECAUSE ONE SHOULD NOT BE INFLUENCED BY REPORTS OR ANECDOTES. THERE IS AN ESSENTIAL FACT: A HARD BLOW HAS BEEN DEALT TO SUBVERSION WITH THE ARREST OF ONE OF ITS PRINCIPAL CHIEFTAINS--NOT A LEADER BUT A CHIEFTAIN. PERU HAS BEEN THE TARGET OF BLOODY TERRORIST ATTACKS. THERE CAN BE NO CONCESSIONS FOR TERRORISTS OTHER THAN THOSE GRANTED BY THE LAW. THIS FACT CANNOT BE DISPELLED BY AN ANECDOTE LIKE THE ONE I READ IN THE NEWSPAPERS TODAY. THE ESSENTIAL FACT IS THAT THIS ARREST IS A MAJOR BLOW TO SUBVERSION. IT WAS NOT MERELY GOOD LUCK, BUT IT WAS THE RESULT OF WORK AND FOLLOW-UP BY THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THE POLICE. I BELIEVE THIS IS THE KEY POINT. I HAVE SEEN THAT ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO A VISIT WHICH WAS NEITHER A COURTESY VISIT NOR AN EXPRESSION OF SUPPORT, BUT JUST A SUPERVISORY ACT, GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FACTS. ANOTHER OBJECTIVE OF THE VISIT, WHICH FOR SURE HAS ALREADY BEEN COMMENTED ON BY SOME COMMUNIST POLITICIANS, WAS TO OBSERVE THE CONDITION OF THE DETAINEE. THE VISIT DID NOT MEAN THAT THE DETAINEE WAS GRANTED SPECIAL STATUS. WE DO NOT GRANT SPECIAL STATUS TO ANYONE, MUCH LESS TO THESE MURDERERS WHO HAVE STAINED THE NATION WITH BLOOD. THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE LAW MUST BE STRICTLY ENFORCED ON THESE INDIVIDUALS. CONSEQUENTLY, THE VISIT BY PRIME MINISTER ARMANDO VILLANUEVA TO THE ANTITERRORIST DIRECTORATE DOES NOT MEAN THAT A DIALOGUE HAS BEGUN OR THAT SOMEONE IS BEING PRAISED, AS SOME ILL-INTENTIONED MASS MEDIA WILL PROBABLY SAY.
DEV-MUC3-0084	LIMA, 3 FEB 89 -- MAOIST SHINING PATH GUERRILLAS HAVE KILLED THE MAYOR OF THE SMALL TOWN OF HOSTIGAL, AS WELL AS TWO PEASANTS, THE LOCAL PRESS REPORTED TODAY. HOSPITAL IS LOCATED SOME 20 KM FROM YAUYOS PROVINCE, LIMA DEPARTMENT. THE SHINING PATH GUERRILLAS ARRIVED IN HOSTIGAL LAST MONDAY MORNING AND FORCED PARISH PRIEST LUIS FUENTES TO SOUND THE ALARM IN ORDER TO GATHER THE PEOPLE. MAYOR ARMANSIO QUISPE AND THE TWO PEASANTS WERE BROUGHT BEFORE A "KANGAROO COURT" BY THE SHINING PATH, AND THEN KILLED BY A FIRING SQUAD. ACCORDING TO THE LATEST CALCULATIONS MADE BY THE PERUVIAN CONGRESS PACIFICATION COMMITTEE, ABOUT 13,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN PERU SINCE 1980 AS A RESULT OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE.
DEV-MUC3-0085	LIMA, 3 FEB 89 -- A SPECTACULAR OPERATION WAS CONDUCTED YESTERDAY NOON WHEN A 39-MAN POLICE PATROL OF THE SANTA LUCIA DETACHMENT, REINFORCED BY ANTI-NARCOTICS POLICE, SURROUNDED THE UCHIZA AIRPORT AND WAITED FOR THE ARRIVAL OF TWO COLOMBIAN LIGHT AIRPLANES THAT WERE SUPPOSEDLY CARRYING DRUGS. A TIP HAD BEEN RECEIVED BY THE POLICE. THE LANDING STRIP WAS SUBJECTED TO CONTINUOUS SURVEILLANCE. A 60-MAN ARMED GROUP OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS APPEARED AT 1620. APPARENTLY, THIS GROUP WAS GOING TO PROTECT THE COLOMBIAN LIGHT AIRPLANES. THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARRIVED ABOARD SEVERAL VEHICLES. THEY DID NOT KNOW THEY WERE BEING WATCHED BY THE POLICE, WHOM THEY OUTNUMBERED. UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND IMPLEMENTING A MASTERLY PLAN, THE POLICE FORCES APPEARED AND A SPECTACULAR SHOOT-OUT ENSUED. SURPRISED BY THE UNEXPECTED ATTACK, THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS RETURNED THE FIRE, WHICH LASTED FOR 1/2 AN HOUR. AS A RESULT OF THE CLASH, TWO DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE KILLED AND FOUR WERE INJURED AND TRANSPORTED TO THE CENTRAL HOSPITAL IN TINGO MARIA. MEANWHILE, 15 DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE ARRESTED; THE REST FLED. AFTER THE INITIAL INVESTIGATIONS, THE CAPTURED DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE FULLY IDENTIFIED. THE FOLLOWING COLOMBIAN CITIZENS WERE INVOLVED: FLORIAN CARVAJAL TELLO, MARIO MONTES MURILLO, AND ROLAND ARAMAYO DIAZ. THE FOLLOWING PERUVIAN CITIZENS WERE INVOLVED: JAIME LEMOS VERA, GUILLERMO ARO MENDIETA, ARMANDO SANCHEZ FLORES, ROMULO ROJAS FARFAN, PERCY ROJAS RODRIGUEZ, RUAL MORETTI CORDOVA, WILLIAM GUAJAN LOSA, CARLOS ROSAS RODRIGUEZ, FERNANDO GARCES ALVARADO, RAUL BEATINO BARDALES, ALCIDES ANGULO DIAZ, AND LUIS RODRIGUEZ CASTILLO. THE NAMES OF THE INJURED DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARE: JOSE HERNANDEZ VELA, CESAR VEGA VILCA, PEDRO ARROYO ELIAS, AND GRACIAN MARTINEZ SAVICH. IN ADDITION, CIVIL GUARDSMEN FOUND NEAR THE UCHIZA LANDING STRIP A TOTAL OF 700 KG OF COCAINE PASTE READY FOR SHIPMENT. TWO NISSAN PICK-UP TRUCKS, ONE TOYOTA PICK-UP TRUCK, SIX REVOLVERS, TWO PISTOLS, AND EIGHT SHOTGUNS OF VARIOUS BRANDS WERE ALSO SEIZED.
DEV-MUC3-0086	MEXICO CITY , 22 MAR 89 -- THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND WILL SOON PRESENT A NEW PEACE PROPOSAL TO ARENA AND THEREFORE CALLS FOR THE FORMATION OF A BROAD COALITION TO FACE THE NEW GOVERNMENT, A COALITION TO INCLUDE THE PDC, WHICH IS NOW AN OPPOSITION PARTY AFTER HAVING LOST THE ELECTIONS. FMLN COMMANDERS ANA GUADUALUPE MARTINEZ, SALVADOR SAMAYOA, AND JOSE MARIA LOPEZ READ THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE AND SAID THAT ARENA'S REACHING POWER DEFINITELY "MEANS THAT THE OLIGARCHY WILL REJOIN THE MILITARY DICTATORSHIP." THE COMMANDERS ALSO EVALUATED THE LAST 5 YEARS OF THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE DUARTE GOVERNMENT IN EL SALVADOR: SALVADOR SAMAYOA SAID: "THE LAST 5 YEARS HAVE BEEN THE MOST DIFFICULT. THE ONLY GOOD THING IS THAT AFTER THE ELECTIONS, WE ARE CLOSER TO DEFINING THE CONFLICT IN EL SALVADOR. "IT HAS BEEN A LONG AND DIFFICULT WAR. THE ENEMY WAS ILL-DEFINED, ENJOYING CERTAIN POPULARITY AMONG THE PEOPLE, MAKING IT EASIER FOR THEM TO TRY AND PERSUADE THEM THAT OUR REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE WAS A TERRORIST WAR WHEN THIS WAS NOT THE CASE." ANA GUADALUPE MARTINEZ SAID: "I BELIEVE THAT THE EVENTS THAT BEGAN IN 1981 ARE COMING FULL CIRCLE NOW, BUT NOW THERE ARE MANY ADVANTAGES. "THE PDC EMERGED FROM A POPULAR STRUGGLE AGAINST THE DICTATORSHIP. NOW THEY ARE IN OPPOSITION AND CAN DEAL WITH THE REST OF THE OPPOSITION AS EQUALS, AND THAT IS AN ADVANTAGE FOR US. "THE SPLIT WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE IS FOR THE BETTER. I BELIEVE WE ARE NOW IN THE FINAL STAGES." WHEN MARTINEZ WAS ASKED HOW SHE WOULD DESCRIBE THE PDC'S ROLE IN EL SALVADOR DURING THE LAST 5 YEARS, SHE REPLIED: "THE PDC PLAYED A VERY NEGATIVE ROLE. IT PROLONGED THE WAR THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN VERY MUCH SHORTER, BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE PDC MAY DEVIATE FROM THEIR PAST BEHAVIOR AND PLAY A DIFFERENT ROLE THAN THE OPPOSITION, FAVORING A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT." THE FMLN COMMANDERS BELIEVED THAT ARENA'S VICTORY WILL BRING BACK THE DEATH SQUADS. THE FMLN COMMANDERS BELIEVE THAT NOW THE POSSIBILITY OF A MILITARY COUP IS GREATER. CONTRARY TO WHAT MIGHT BE BELIEVED, THE FMLN COMANDERS SAID: "WE DO NOT SEE A STRONG RIGHT WING. WE SEE THEM MORE TRAPPED POLITICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY." THE COMMANDERS ALSO ARGUED THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO FACE THE SAME OLIGARCHY AND ARMY THEY FACED IN 1979. THE MESSAGE THEY HAVE FOR ARENA STATES: "SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED? IS IT NOT ENOUGH TO HAVE LAUNCHED A MILITARY OFFENSIVE?" THE COMMANDERS SAID THAT, NEVERTHELESS, THE FMLN IS READY FOR A GREAT MILITARY EFFORT AND REITERATED THAT IF ANYTHING CLEARLY EMERGED DURING THE LAST 2 MONTHS, IT IS THAT "WE ARE A POLITICAL MAJORITY IN EL SALVADOR."
DEV-MUC3-0087	SAN SALVADOR, 27 SEP 88 -- SALVADORAN COLONEL CIRO LOPEZ, COMMANDER OF THE "EL PARAISO" GARRISON, WHICH WAS ATTACKED BY THE GUERRILLAS ON 13 SEPTEMBER, DENIED TODAY THAT THREE U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS HAD PARTICIPATED IN THE CLASH WITH THE REBELS, CONTRARY TO WHAT THE U.S. MEDIA AND PRESIDENT HAVE STATED. LOPEZ SAID THE "THREE ADVISERS DID NOT SHOOT, BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ARMED AND WERE IN A PILLBOX WITH A VIEW OF THE INSIDE PART OF THE GARRISON TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THE MORTAR FIRE." HE ADDED THAT THE THREE ADVISERS "HAVE NOT PARTICIPATED IN ANY FIGHTING" BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO HIM, "THEY WERE IN A SECURITY AREA DURING THE TERRORIST ATTACK." THE INFORMATION THAT THE U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS HAD DIRECTLY PARTICIPATED IN THE SHOOTING CAUSED BY THE GUERRILLA ATTACK WAS CARRIED BY THE WASHINGTON POST AND CORROBORATED BY PRESIDENT REAGAN, WHO AFFIRMED THAT THEY HAD "FIRED IN SELF-DEFENSE." ACCORDING TO THE REPORT PUBLISHED BY THE WASHINGTON POST, THREE U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS RESPONDED TO THE REBEL FIRE AGAINST THE SALVADORAN MILITARY INSTALLATION IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY. THE ARMY SUSTAINED 9 DEAD AND 12 WOUNDED AS A RESULT OF THE FMLN GUERRILLA ATTACK ON THE "EL PARAISO" GARRISON. A U.S. DIPLOMATIC SOURCE WHO CHOSE TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS STATED IN THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL THAT "THE ADVISERS HAVE A RIGHT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES, ESPECIALLY OUTSIDE OF SAN SALVADOR, BUT NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN COMBAT OR ATTACK MISSIONS." IN HIS STATEMENTS, RONALD REAGAN SUPPORTED THE ACTION OF THE MILITARY ADVISERS AND ADDED THAT "I HAVE NEVER SENT MY MEN TO FACE ANY DANGER WITHOUT GIVING THEM THE CHANCE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES IF THEY ARE ATTACKED." IN MARCH 1987, DURING ANOTHER ATTACK ON THE GARRISON, U.S. SERGEANT GREGORY FRONIUS, A MILITARY ADVISER, WAS KILLED. CURRENTLY, 55 OF THE 119 U.S. ADVISERS IN EL SALVADOR ARE MILITARY INSTRUCTORS.
DEV-MUC3-0088	NO CITY , 28 MAR 89 -- RADIO VENCEREMOS IN SPANISH TO EL SALVADOR AT 0000 GMT ON ON 29 MARCH BROADCASTS APPROXIMATELY 6 MINUTES OF WAR REPORTS. THE FIRST OF THE REPORTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE READ BY THE STATION ANNOUNCER, DESCRIBES EVENTS IN CHALATENANGO. THE REPORT STATES THAT ON 27 MARCH AT 2100, FMLN UNITS BEGAN ATTACKING ATLACATL BATTALION POSITIONS IN PLAN DEL PICACHO, LA CEIBITA, AMATILLO, LA CEIBA AREA, TEMPISQUE HILL, AND EL COPINOL, ALL OF WHICH ARE WITHIN LAS VUELTAS JURISDICTION, CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT. THE ATTACK LASTED FOR 4 HOURS, AND WHEN IT CONCLUDED THE ARMY'S TROOPS HAD BEEN DISLODGED FROM THEIR POSITIONS IN LA CEIBITA AND PLAN DEL PICACHO. THE "ENEMY" SENT REINFORCEMENTS TO TEMPISQUE HILL AND EL COPINOL 1 HOUR LATER, BUT "THIS EFFORT PROVED USELESS" AND AIR SUPPORT HAD TO BE CALLED IN. THE CLASH LASTED UNTIL 0400 ON 28 MARCH, RESULTING IN NINE CASUALTIES. THE STATION ANNOUNCER GOES ON TO REPORT THAT ON 28 MARCH AT 1000, SNIPER UNITS ENTERED PLAN DEL PICACHO AND INFLICTED THREE CASUALTIES ON THE ATLACATL BATTALION. ANOTHER REPORT FROM THE SAME AREA INDICATES THAT ON 27 MARCH AN ATLACATL BATTALION UNIT ENTERED A MINE FIELD SET UP BY THE FMLN IN PLAN DEL PICACHO, RESULTING IN THREE ARMY CASUALTIES. ALL IN ALL, OVER 2 DAYS THE FMLN CLAIMS TO HAVE INFLICTED 15 CASUALTIES ON THE ATLACATL BATTALION. THE STATION ANNOUNCER GOES ON TO REPORT THAT ON 27 MARCH FMLN UNITS WITH RIFLES, RIFLE GRENADES, AND HOMEMADE ARTILLERY ATTACKED ARMY POSITIONS AT THE 5 NOVEMBER DAM.

THE AMBUSH TOOK PLACE IN CASITAS, TEXISTEPEQUE JURISDICTION, WHEN TWO POWERFUL FELICIANO AMA MINES EXPLODED, INFLICTING EIGHT CASUALTIES ON THE ARMY AND TOTALLY DESTROYING A MILITARY VEHICLE.
DEV-MUC3-0089	SAN SALVADOR, 29 MAR 89 -- ORLANDO QUITENO, SPOKESMAN FOR THE LEMPA RIVER HYDROELECTRIC EXECUTIVE COMMISSION, HAS REPORTED THAT IN THE PAST FEW HOURS THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS HAVE DESTROYED AT LEAST 10 POWER TRANSMISSION TOWERS, DAMAGING SEVEN HIGH VOLTAGE LINES IN THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. QUITENO SAID THAT THE NEW SABOTAGE CAUSED A 25-PERCENT ENERGY LOSS IN SAN SALVADOR. THE DAMAGE TO THE ENERGY SYSTEM CAUSED TRAFFIC JAMS IN SAN SALVADOR AND A VIRTUAL PARALYSIS IN ACTIVITIES BECAUSE OF ENERGY RATIONING. THE RESUMPTION OF THE SABOTAGE AGAINST THE ENERGY SYSTEM IS ACCOMPANIED BY THE RESUMPTION OF REBEL ATTACKS AGAINST BROTHELS, TWO OF WHICH WERE DESTROYED IN THE LAST 24 HOURS, ALTHOUGH NO CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED. THE BROTHELS REPORTEDLY HAVE BEEN ATTACKED BECAUSE IT IS BELIEVED THAT WOMEN ARE EXPLOITED THERE. IN ADDITION, URBAN GUERRILLAS BLEW UP A PUBLIC BUS IN A NEIGHBORHOOD LOCATED NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR; NO CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED.
DEV-MUC3-0090	FRIJANES, 29 MAR 89 -- ELITE UNITS OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMY THIS AFTERNOON BEGAN TO SURROUND PAVON PRISON, WHICH SINCE 26 MARCH HAS BEEN IN THE HANDS OF SOME 200 PRISONERS WHO ARE HOLDING MORE THAN 500 PEOPLE HOSTAGE. THE UNITS WERE DEPLOYED TO PAVON, 30 KM SOUTHEAST OF THE GUATEMALAN CAPITAL, TO APPLY PRESSURE ON THE PRISONERS, WHO TODAY REFUSED TO SIGN A DOCUMENT CONTAINING GUARANTEES DRAFTED BY THE MEDIATION COMMISSION. INSTEAD, THE PRISONERS PRESENTED A COUNTERPROPOSAL TO THE MEDIATION COMMISSION--WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED BY PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO HIMSELF TO "PREVENT BLOODSHED"--SEVERAL COMMISSION MEMBERS SAID AS THEY LEFT THE PENAL CENTER. A POSSIBLE PEACEFUL SOLUTION THAT WAS HOPED FOR YESTERDAY IS AGAIN "ON HOLD" TODAY BECAUSE OF THE REBELS' REFUSAL TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT. HUMAN RIGHTS ATTORNEY GENERAL GONZALO MENENDEZ SAID THAT "THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM IS AGAIN AT AN IMPASSE, BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER MUST ANALYZE THE PRISONERS' PROPOSAL." THE UPRISING, WHICH BEGAN AT 1100 ON 26 MARCH AND WHICH INCLUDES DEMANDS FOR BETTER JAIL CONDITIONS, HAS LEFT AT LEAST 12 DEAD AND SOME 20 INJURED, ACCORDING TO POLICE SPOKESMEN. SOME 150 HONOR GUARD MEMBERS, "ALL EXPERTS IN DISORDERS AND UPRISINGS," HAVE BEEN POSITIONED NEAR THE PRISON UNDER THE COMMAND OF A LIEUTENANT COLONEL AND FIVE OTHER OFFICERS, ACCORDING TO STATEMENTS MADE TO ACAN-EFE BY A TOP MILITARY OFFICER, WHO ASKED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS. THE ASSAULT TROOPS ARE ARMED WITH BATONS, TEAR GAS, GAS MASKS, AND MACHINEGUNS. "MY MEN ARE CAPABLE OF DEALING WITH DISORDERS AND HAVE BEEN PREPARED FOR CASES SUCH AS THIS ONE," THE MILITARY CHIEF SAID. THE REBELLIOUS PRISONERS, WHO HAVE CONTROL OF 65 PERCENT OF THE PRISON INSTALLATIONS, REMAIN INFLEXIBLE AND REFUSE TO RELEASE THE HOSTAGES AND LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS. DESPITE THE MEDIATING COMMISSION'S OPTIMISM, AFTER 72 HOURS THE REBELLIOUS PRISONERS PRESENTED A NEW PROPOSAL TODAY AT NOON, HUMAN RIGHTS ATTORNEY GENERAL GONZALO MENENDEZ SAID.
DEV-MUC3-0091	LA PAZ, 29 MAR 89 -- INTERIOR MINISTRY UNDER SECRETARY WALTER COSTAS BADANI HAS STATED THAT BOLIVIAN INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE YET TO DETECT THE PRESENCE OF SHINING PATH TERRORISTS IN BOLIVIA. COSTAS BADANI TOLD PANAMERICANA THAT THE PERUVIAN PRESS ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS HAS TRIED TO IMPLICATE BOLIVIAN TIES IN THIS TERRORIST ORGANIZATION'S ACTIVITIES. COSTAS BADANI POINTED OUT THAT THE SHINING PATH GUERRILLAS HAVE CONDUCTED THEIR TERRORIST OPERATIONS EXCLUSIVELY IN PERUVIAN TERRITORY AND THAT BOLIVIA HAS NO CONNECTION WHATSOEVER WITH THIS GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION. THE REPORTS ABOUT THESE TIES ARE ALARMING AND GROUNDLESS. THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS, AND ESPECIALLY THE PERUVIAN MEDIA, HAVE OFTEN TRIED TO INVOLVE BOLIVIA IN THE TERRORIST PROBLEMS, WHICH I DO NOT THINK HAVE GONE BEYOND PERU'S BORDERS. WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM, AND ANY RUMOR IN THIS REGARD IS GROUNDLESS SPECULATION. COSTAS BADANI ALSO SAID THAT, IF NECESSARY, THE APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENT SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS WILL CARRY OUT THEIR SPECIFIC DUTIES IN A COORDINATED MANNER. THIS MEANS THAT THEY WILL EXCHANGE INFORMATION WITH SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS OF THE ARMED FORCES.
DEV-MUC3-0092	BOGOTA, 10 MAR 89 -- THREE MEMBERS OF THE GANG CALLED THE OWLS WERE ARRESTED IN MEDELLIN IN CONNECTION WITH THE ATTACK ON SENATOR ERNESTO SAMPER AND PATRIOTIC UNION LEADER JOSE ANTEQUERA. THE MEN WERE ARRESTED IN TWO OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE POLICE IN DOWNTOWN MEDELLIN AND IN THE EL PEDREGAL NEIGHBORHOOD. THE MINUTE WE RECEIVED INFORMATION THAT ONE OF THE SUSPECTED MURDERERS WAS FROM MEDELLIN, WE DECIDED TO OPEN AN INVESTIGATION AND SOLVE THE CASE. THREE MEN WERE ARRESTED YESTERDAY. WE ARE COORDINATING WITH SECURITY OFFICIALS FROM BOGOTA AND CRIMINAL INVESTIGATORS IN MEDELLIN ON THE LEGAL PROCEDURES TO BE FOLLOWED. NONE OF THE MEN HAD IDENTIFICATION PAPERS OR WEAPONS. ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES, THOSE ARRESTED MAY BE MEMBERS OF A BAND CALLED THE OWLS THAT HAS BEEN OPERATING IN THE NORTHEASTERN PART OF THE CITY.

GIRARDO BATTALION OFFICERS, WHO ASKED US NOT TO REVEAL THEIR NAMES, STATED THAT THE REBELS, WHO WERE MEMBERS OF THE FARC 28TH FRONT, ATTACKED TWO TRUCKS FILLED WITH SOLDIERS. THE SANTA RITA POLICE CHIEF FOUND THE BODIES OF A SOLDIER AND A REBEL ON THE ROAD LEADING TO SANTA RITA. THE SOLDIER WAS IDENTIFIED AS EDISON ESTRADA BOLIVAR. SOLDIER RAUL DURANGO HERRERA WAS WOUNDED AND TAKEN TO THE PABLO TOBON URIBE HOSPITAL IN MEDELLIN. THE DEAD REBEL, WHO HAS NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED, HAD A SUBMACHINEGUN, 3 CLIPS, AND 30 9-MM CARTRIDGES ON HIM. ITUANGO MUNICIPALITY, 195 KM NORTH OF MEDELLIN, IS NEAR LOWER CAUCA, WHERE THE ARMY DISMANTLED DURING HOLY WEEK A FARC 37TH FRONT PLAN DESIGNED TO COMMIT AND CARRY OUT AMBUSHES AND ASSAULTS. MEANWHILE, AT LEAST 50 FARC REBELS BLEW UP A JEEP NEAR SAN JUAN DE URAMA MUNICIPALITY NEAR ROAD NO 32 IN META DEPARTMENT.

COL FERRERO EXPLAINED THAT "IN PRINCIPLE, WE HAVE REPORTS SAYING MANY PEOPLE WERE KILLED, BUT WE DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY. WE KNOW SEVEN PEASANTS WERE MURDERED BY FARC 12TH FRONT MEMBERS." HELICOPTERS CONTINUE OVERFLYING THE BATTLE ZONE. AIRBORNE TROOPS REPLACED THE TROOPS WHO WERE FIGHTING AGAINST THE MEN UP IN ARMS. PEASANTS WHO ARRIVED AT SAN VICENTE CHUCURRI SAID POWERFUL EXPLOSIONS HAVE BEEN CONTINUOUSLY HEARD SINCE THE MILITARY ACTIONS BEGAN ON 22 MARCH. ARMY OFFICERS BELIEVE THE REBEL COLUMN IS SURROUNDED IN A MOUNTAINOUS STRIP LOCATED BETWEEN EL CARMEN AND SAN VICENTE CHUCURRI MUNICIPALITIES. GEN VACA PERILLA RETURNED TO THE AREA YESTERDAY, BUT HE DID NOT MAKE ANY STATEMENTS. HE HAS BEEN COMMANDING OPERATIONS IN THE AREA FOR THE LAST 5 DAYS. AN UNOFFICIAL REPORT INDICATED TWO HELICOPTERS WERE HIT BY FARC REBELS' RIFLE FIRE. SAN VICENTE CHUCURRI PARISH PRIEST JUVENAL MARTINEZ SAID THE AREA RESIDENTS AND THE COMMON FRONT ARE TRYING TO FORM A COMMISSION TO VERIFY WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE AREA.
DEV-MUC3-0094	LIMA, 29 MAR 89 -- A BOMB EXPLODED TODAY IN A LIMA RESTAURANT, AND A SECOND DEVICE THAT HAD BEEN PLACED IN THE SAME ESTABLISHMENT WAS DEACTIVATED BY THE PERUVIAN NATIONAL POLICE. THERE WERE NO VICTIMS, AND THE EXPLOSION CAUSED VERY LITTLE DAMAGE TO THE RESTAURANT, WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE COMMERCIAL ARE OF THE RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT OF MIRAFLORES.

DEV-MUC3-0095	NO CITY , 27 MAR 89 -- RADIO VENCEREMOS IN SPANISH TO EL SALVADOR AT 0000 GMT ON 28 MARCH BROADCASTS TWO MILITARY REPORTS LASTING APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES. THE FIRST REPORT STATES THAT AT 0330 ON 25 MARCH, A FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT UNIT LAUNCHED A 5-MINUTE ATTACK AGAINST A 5TH INFANTRY BRIGADE UNIT LOCATED AT LAST DELICIAS HACIENDA, SAN ESTEBAN JURISDICTION, SAN VICENTE DEPARTMENT, USING PEOPLE'S ARTILLERY, HAND GRENADES, AND RIFLE FIRE. THE REPORT ADDS THAT "AFTER 5 MINUTES, THE ENEMY WAS UNDER COMPLETE CONTROL, HAVING SUFFERED 12 CASUALTIES." THE FMLN CLAIMED THEY LEFT UNIMPEDED "AFTER COMPLETING THE MISSION." THE OTHER REPORT TELLS OF A "DARING AMBUSH USING THREE M-18 MINES AND CONTACT GRENADES" THAT TOOK PLACE AT 0630 ON 22 MARCH AGAINST A NATIONAL GUARD UNIT AT QUEBRADA LA ALGRABILLA, CANTON LAS PUERTAS, MERCEDES UMANAS JURISDICTION, "INFLICTING SIX CASUALTIES UPON THE NATIONAL GUARD."
DEV-MUC3-0096	CLANDESTINE, 30 MAR 89 -- A REPORT FROM SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT STATES THAT FMLN ANTIAIRCRAFT UNITS AMBUSHED A SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTER IN ARENALES CANTON AT 1700 GMT ON 29 MARCH, AS IT WAS TRAVELING FROM USULUTAN TO SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT. OUR UNITS' EFFECTIVE ANTIAIRCRAFT FIRE HIT AND DAMAGED THE HELICOPTER. THE HELICOPTER WAS FORCED TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY LANDING IN JUCUAPA. THIS REPORT CONFIRMS THAT THE PILOT WAS KILLED AND ONE CREW MEMBER WAS INJURED AS A RESULT OF THE EMERGENCY LANDING.

THAT IS THE REPORT WE ARE RECEIVING FROM JUCUAPA, WHERE THE HELICOPTER WAS FORCED TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY LANDING. THE REPORT ADDS THAT A FEW MINUTES AFTER THE AMBUSH A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP ARRIVED IN THE AREA, LAUNCHING ROCKETS AND INDISCRIMINATELY FIRING AT THE LA NORIA AND LA PENA CANTONS' CIVILIAN POPULATION.

DEV-MUC3-0098	BOGOTA, 29 MAR 89 -- DIEGO MONTANA, ACTING PRESIDENT OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION , TOLD EFE TODAY THAT ONLY THE PARTICIPATION OF THE SIMON BOLIVAR NATIONAL GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD IN THE PEACE TALKS COULD GUARANTEE A POLITICAL SOLUTION IN COLOMBIA. THE CNG GROUPS THE SIX MAIN LEFTIST GUERRILLA ORGANIZATIONS THAT OPERATE IN COLOMBIA. THERE ARE 20,000 GUERRILLAS IN 100 FRONTS THROUGHOUT COLOMBIA. THE GROUPS COMPRISING THE CNG ARE THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA ; THE POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY ; CAMILISTA UNION-ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION ; THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT ; QUINTIN LAME MOVEMENT ; AND THE REVOLUTIONARY WORKERS PARTY . TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT, THE M-19, AND THE TRADITIONAL POLITICAL PARTIES WILL BEGIN IN BOGOTA ON 3 APRIL AS PART OF THE DIALOGUE PROCESS, WHICH THE GOVERNMENT AND GUERRILLA MOVEMENTS BEGAN LAST JANUARY TO ACHIEVE PEACE. THE UP ANNOUNCED IN EARLY MARCH THAT IT WOULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE ROUNDTABLES, THE NAME GIVEN TO THE TALKS THAT WILL BEGIN NEXT MONDAY AND IN WHICH THE PARTICIPANTS WILL DISCUSS THE LARGE NUMBER OF POLITICAL CRIMES THAT HAVE BEEN PERPETRATED BY RIGHTIST PARAMILITARY GROUPS. SINCE THE UP WAS FOUNDED, NEARLY 1,000 OF ITS MEMBERS AND LEADERS HAVE BEEN MURDERED. THE "DIRTY WAR" AGAINST THE LEFT, PROGRESSIVE POLITICIANS, AND HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS HAS RESULTED IN 700 POLITICAL ASSASSINATIONS SO FAR THIS YEAR. THERE WERE 2,978 POLITICAL ASSASSINATIONS IN 1988; 1,200 IN 1987; AND 1,000 IN 1986. IN ADDITION, NEARLY 1,500 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN CLASHES BETWEEN THE ARMED FORCES AND GUERRILLAS IN 1988. SO FAR THIS YEAR, ABOUT 100 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN CLASHES. DIEGO MONTANA TOLD EFE THAT HE WAS PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE M-19 HAD INITIATED PEACE TALKS WITH THE GOVERNMENT, BUT HE NOTED THAT THE REST OF THE CNG ACCOUNTS FOR 84 PERCENT OF THE REBELS. "I AM PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS HOLDING TALKS WITH 16 PERCENT OF THE GUERRILLAS," MONTANA SAID, "BUT THE PEACE PROCESS WILL NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IF THE OTHER 84 PERCENT OF THE GUERRILLA GROUPS KEEP ON FIGHTING." MONTANA ALSO PRAISED THE LATEST COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE CNG, WHICH WAS SIGNED BY THE FARC, THE EPL, AND THE UC-ELN, WHICH ANNOUNCED THEIR DECISION TO BEGIN TALKS WITH THE GOVERNMENT, BUT WHICH LINKED THEIR PARTICIPATION TO THE DISMANTLING OF RIGHTIST PARAMILITARY GROUPS. MOREOVER, JACOBO ARENAS, COMMANDER OF THE FARC AND MEMBER OF THE CNG STAFF, TOLD BOGOTA EMISORAS CARACOL NETWORK THAT "ANYTHING LEADING TO THE OPENING OF ROADS, THE BUILDING OF BRIDGES, AND THE OPENING OF LOCKS IS BENEFICIAL," AND HE PRAISED THE TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE M-19 IN THAT REGARD. ARENAS, HOWEVER, SAID THE M-19 HAD PULLED ITSELF OUT OF THE CNG BY REACHING A PEACE AGREEMENT ON ITS OWN AND THAT IN THE NEXT PLENARY MEETING THE POSSIBLE EXPULSION OF THE M-19 FROM THE CNG WOULD BE STUDIED.
DEV-MUC3-0099	LIMA, 29 MAR 89 -- JUSTICE MINISTER CESAR DELGADO BARRETO SAID TODAY THAT THE TRAGIC INCIDENT AT UCHIZA DEMONSTRATES THAT THERE IS AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND TERRORISTS, AND THAT THE COUNTRY SHOULD MAKE A MORE INTENSE EFFORT AGAINST THEM. HE SAID THAT THE ATTACK IS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE BLOWS THAT POLICE HAVE DEALT TO DRUG TRAFFICKERS, INCLUDING THE ARREST OF SEVERAL DRUG GANG LEADERS IN UCHIZA, A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE ATTACK. HE ADDED THAT IN ORDER TO STRUGGLE SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, PERU NEEDS MORE TECHNOLOGICAL AND FINANCIAL AID, ESPECIALLY FROM THE UNITED STATES, THE WORLD'S LARGEST DRUG CONSUMER.
DEV-MUC3-0100	LIMA, 30 MAR 89 -- A CARGO TRAIN RUNNING FROM LIMA TO LOROHIA WAS DERAILED BEFORE DAWN TODAY AFTER HITTING A DYNAMITE CHARGE. INSPECTOR EULOGIO FLORES DIED IN THE EXPLOSION. THE POLICE REPORTED THAT THE INCIDENT TOOK PLACE PAST MIDNIGHT IN THE CARAHUAICHI-JAURIN AREA.
DEV-MUC3-0101	SAN SALVADOR, 30 OCT 89 -- PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI SAID POSITIVE RESULTS WERE OBTAINED DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT IN COSTA RICA. ONE OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS, CRISTIANI SAID, IS THAT THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD BILATERAL TALKS WITH SOUTH AMERICAN PRESIDENTS. WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD BILATERAL TALKS WITH SOUTH AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND TO BRIEF THEM ON THE PEACE PROCESS, THE GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO ATTAIN PEACE, AND THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PEACE PROCESS. THE PRESIDENTS RECEIVED FIRSTHAND INFORMATION ON THE PEACE PLAN AND ON THE RESULTS THE GOVERNMENT EXPECTS FROM THIS PROCESS . I BELIEVE WE HAVE RECEIVED GREAT SUPPORT FOR THE PEACE PROCESS. AS A COUNTRY, EL SALVADOR HAS RECEIVED THE LATIN AMERICAN PRESIDENTS' SUPPORT FOR THE PEACE PROCESS, ESPECIALLY THE SUPPORT OF THE SOUTH AMERICAN PRESIDENTS WITH WHOM WE HAD NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD BILATERAL TALKS. REGARDING THE COFFEE PROBLEM, CRISTIANI SAID THE PRESIDENTS NOTED THE NEED FOR REACHING AGREEMENTS ON THE COFFEE PACT AND THE PRICE OF COFFEE. HE ADDED THAT DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT HE CONDEMNED, IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL PRESIDENTS, THE AID NICARAGUA GIVES TO THE FMLN . HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT, CRISTIANI STATED. CONCERNING THE RECENT ATTACKS BLAMED ON THE GUERRILLAS, PARTICULARLY THE 30 OCTOBER ATTACK ON THE ARMY'S HIGH COMMAND, CRISTIANI SAID THIS IS REGRETTABLE BECAUSE CIVILIANS ARE MORE AFFECTED BY SUCH ATTACKS. THIS INCIDENT TAKES PLACE AT A TIME WHEN THE FMLN IS TRYING TO SHOW ITS STRENGTH. THE FMLN IS ALSO TRYING TO PROVOKE SOME REACTION FROM THE ARMED FORCES SO THAT THE ARMY, IN A GIVEN MOMENT, EXERTS PRESSURE TO SUSPEND THE DIALOGUE PROCESS. I THINK THIS IS THE REASON FOR THEIR ATTITUDE. CRISTIANI ADDED THAT SUCH ATTITUDES WILL NOT HINDER THE DIALOGUE PROCESS IN VENEZUELA. HE ADDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL WILL BE THE SAME PROPOSAL PRESENTED IN COSTA RICA AND IT WILL BE FULLY DISCUSSED. HOWEVER, THE PRIORITY WILL ALWAYS BE THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES.
DEV-MUC3-0102	SAN SALVADOR, 2 NOV 89 -- RADIO CADENA YSKL'S NEWS CENTER RECEIVED A TELEPHONE CALL FROM THE FMLN SPOKESMEN. ACCORDING TO THEM, THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN HAS BEEN SUSPENDED. THE INFORMATION SAYS THAT FMLN GENERAL COMMAND MADE THE DECISION GIVEN THE LATEST ACTIONS CARRIED OUT IN THE COUNTRY--SPECIFICALLY THE ATTACK ON FENASTRAS , WHICH RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF 10 UNION MEMBERS. WE REPEAT: THE FMLN HAS CALLED US TO REPORT THAT THE MEETING SCHEDULED BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA, HAS BEEN SUSPENDED GIVEN THE EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN RECENT DAYS, PARTICULARLY THE KILLING OF 10 LABOR UNION MEMBERS AT THE FENASTRAS HEADQUARTERS ON TUESDAY, 31 OCTOBER. WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION HAS TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED THE DIALOGUE UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES THE PROTECTION OF CIVIC-CULTURAL AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS IN THE COUNTRY.
DEV-MUC3-0103	BOGOTA, 9 MAR 89 -- ARMY GENERAL JAIME RUIZ BARRERA REPORTS THAT OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS THE ARMY HAS CONDUCTED OPERATIONS IN SOUTHWESTERN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT DURING WHICH CLASHES HAVE OCCURRED BETWEEN ARMY TROOPS AND ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION, ELN, AND PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY, EPL, GUERRILLAS. NUTIBARA BATTALION TROOPS INFLICTED SEVERAL CASUALTIES ON AN ELN SQUAD DURING A CLASH IN SALGAR AND PROCEEDED TO SEIZE WAR MATERIEL, EXPLOSIVES, AND SOME VERY IMPORTANT MILITARY INTELLIGENCE DOCUMENTS. A NUTIBARA BATTALION NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER WAS SUBSEQUENTLY KILLED IN A CLASH IN URRAO. WE ASKED HIM ABOUT REPORTS THAT THE ELN AND EPL ARE INSISTING THAT PRIVATE FARMS HIRE WORKERS TO BENEFIT THEM. TWO GROUPS, ONE FROM THE ELN AND ANOTHER FROM THE EPL, HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN SOUTHWESTERN ANTIOQUIA, SPECIFICALLY IN THE TRIANGLE FORMED BY CARMEN DE ATRATO, SALGAR, AND CIUDAD BOLIVAR MUNICIPALITIES. THESE TWO REBEL GROUPS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO INTIMIDATE FARMERS INTO ALLOWING THEM TO DESIGNATE A FEW INDIVIDUALS TO WORK ON THEIR FARMS. IT HAS GOTTEN TO THE POINT THAT REBEL CELLS ARE DEMANDING THAT THEY BE ALLOWED TO DESIGNATE BUTLERS TO WORK ON THE LARGER FARMS.
DEV-MUC3-0104	CLANDESTINE, 2 NOV 89 -- COMRADE SANCHO, WHY HAS THE FMLN DECIDED NOT TO ATTEND THE CARACAS MEETING? THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND INSTRUCTED ME THIS AFTERNOON TO ANNOUNCE TO THE NATION A COMMUNIQUE IN WHICH WE DECIDED NOT TO ATTEND THE CARACAS MEETING AND DIALOGUE. THE REASON FOR THIS IS THE RECENT FENASTRAS MASSACRE, WHICH WE BELIEVE CANNOT BE IGNORED. THIS IS NOT JUST ANOTHER ATTACK, LIKE THE ONES WE ARE USED TO, BUT AN ATTACK THAT SIGNALS A NEW POLITICAL ERA SIMILAR TO THOSE WHEN AN ELECTORAL MASSACRE OCCURRED, WHEN MSGR ARNULFO ROMERO WAS MURDERED, WHEN OTHER CRIMES MARKED NEW STEPS IN THE NEW FASCIST ESCALATION OF THE DICTATORSHIP NOW LED BY ALFREDO CRISTIANI, COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, AND THE GREAT EXECUTIONER AND PERPETRATOR OF MASSACRES, ELENA FUENTES. THE MAIN THING IS THAT THE FASCIST MILITARY DICTATORSHIP, HEADED BY A SMALL ARMED FORCES GROUP, HAS BEEN EXPOSED. WE DO NOT THINK THIS CAN BE IGNORED. THE STATE AND HAVE TO PAY A POLITICAL PRICE. THIS PRICE IS COL PONCE'S RESIGNATION, WHICH IS NOW DEMANDED BY THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT. AFTER THE ATTACK, INSTEAD OF SEEKING A DETENTE, THE ARMY, ON THE CONTRARY, CONTINUED ITS PROVOCATIONS. FOR INSTANCE, SEVERAL PLAINCLOTHES MEMBERS OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE FENASTRAS AND THE POPULAR MOVEMENT TOOK THEM PRISONER. MORE THAN 30 OF THEM WERE DETAINED. WE LEARNED THIS AFTERNOON THAT THE POLICE RELEASED A COMMUNIQUE SAYING THEY WOULD STATION ANTIRIOT POLICEMEN AT THE NATIONAL CEMETERY. WE ALSO HEARD COL MAURICIO VARGAS SAYING THAT, IF THE DIALOGUE DOOR IS CLOSED, IT HAS TO BE KICKED OPEN. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE SITUATION AFTER THE COWARDLY ATTACK ON FENASTRAS? WE THINK ALL THESE ACTIVITIES OF THE DEATH SQUADS, THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE, THE POLICE, AND THE NATIONAL GUARD ARE ONLY THE OPEN EXPRESSION OF THE ARMED FORCES' POSITION, WHICH IS TO PLAN A FULL-SCALE CONFRONTATION WITH THE POPULAR MOVEMENT. WE THINK THIS INDICATES BEHIND THE BACKS OF THE MAJORITY OF ARMED FORCES MEMBERS. IT IS A MINORITY WHO HAVE DECIDED ON THESE PROVOCATIONS AGAINST THE POPULAR MOVEMENT. THIS MOVEMENT, HOWEVER, IS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG TO DISARM THESE PROVOCATEURS, PRESENT THEM TO THE PRESS, AND HAND THEM OVER TO SHOW THAT THE PEOPLE EXPRESS THEIR TREMENDOUS POWER WHENEVER THEY WANT. WITH LA TANDONA IN POWER, AND WITH THE SITUATION THE ARENA ERA HAS USHERED IN, IS THERE NO POSSIBLE SOLUTION THROUGH DIALOGUE? WHAT OTHER ALTERNATIVE DO YOU HAVE? I BELIEVE THAT IT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI AND THE HIGH COMMAND ARE PRACTICALLY DOING AWAY WITH POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES, AS OUR EARLIER COMMUNIQUE ISSUED AFTER THE FENASTRAS ATTACK INDICATES. THE END RESULT IS THAT SINCE THERE IS NO POLITICAL FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH TO ESTABLISH A POLITICAL GAME WITH CERTAIN POLITICAL RULES FOR THE OPPOSITION AND STATE FORCES, OUR ONLY OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS TO IMMEDIATELY TAKE UP OUR WEAPONS, BECAUSE THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OF GUARANTEEING THE SURVIVAL OF THE POPULAR MOVEMENT AND THE NATION. THE PEOPLE'S LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO DEFENSE IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY LEGITIMATE, AND IT IS GAINING GREATER NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION. THE POPULAR MOVEMENT IS ONCE AGAIN FACING A DECISIVE MOMENT IN THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY, AND THE WORKERS ARE GIVING THEIR SHARE OF BLOOD IN THIS STRUGGLE. WHAT MESSAGE WOULD YOU SEND TO THE POPULAR MOVEMENT, ESPECIALLY TO THE COMRADE WORKERS AT FENASTRAS? ON THIS OCCASION, I WISH TO SEND A SPECIAL MESSAGE TO FENASTRAS. I MUST TELL THEM TO CONTINUE TO BE INSPIRED BY THE PUREST CONCEPTS OF THE POPULAR STRUGGLE, TO KEEP THEIR INSPIRATION, TO BE CREATIVE AND COOL, AND THAT WHEN PEOPLE BEGIN TO CREATE THEIR OWN HISTORY, THEY ARE TRULY INVINCIBLE. I BELIEVE THAT FENASTRAS HAS THE PEOPLE'S FULL SUPPORT AND THAT IT WILL GRADUALLY GAIN EVEN MORE SUPPORT. FENASTRAS MUST CONTINUE--AS ITS LEADERS SAY--ON THE WARPATH. IN REALITY, THE COST IN LIVES OF LEADERS SUCH AS FEBE ELIZABETH AND ALL THE OTHERS WHO WERE KILLED, AS WELL AS THOSE KILLED IN THE PAST, IS QUITE HIGH. THE COST IS POLITICAL. IT HAS TAKEN LIVES BUT THIS, IN REALITY, STRENGTHENS THE ORGANIZATION. THE PEOPLE'S RESPONSE HAS BEEN ONE OF ANGER AND DISCONTENT, AND THIS DISCONTENT WILL EVENTUALLY TURN INTO A CLAMOR FOR ARMED STRUGGLE BY SECTORS THAT REALLY AND TO ACHIEVE OUR PEOPLE'S FREEDOM.
DEV-MUC3-0105	SAN SALVADOR, 2 NOV 89 -- EL SALVADOR'S LARGEST ORGANIZATION OF LABOR UNIONS, ASSOCIATIONS, AND RELIGIOUS GROUPS TODAY REGRETTED THE LEFTIST GUERRILLAS' DECISION TO SUSPEND THEIR DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND EXPRESSED HOPE THAT THIS MEASURE IS NOT "IRREVOCABLE." REVERAND EDGAR PALACIOS, THE MAIN REPRESENTATIVE OF THE BAPTIST CHURCH AND COORDINATOR OF THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE FOR THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE FOR PEACE, COMPRISING ABOUT 65 ORGANIZATIONS, TOLD THE PRESS ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S RIGHTIST GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN NO INDICATION IT WANTS PEACE. THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S GENERAL COMMAND ANNOUNCED IN A COMMUNIQUE ON 2 NOVEMBER THAT IT HAD CANCELED ANOTHER ROUND OF THE DIALOGUE SCHEDULED FOR 20-21 NOVEMBER IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA, WHICH WERE TO CONTINUE TALKS THAT BEGAN IN SEPTEMBER TO END A 10-YEAR CIVIL WAR. THE REBELS CLAIMED AN INTENSIFICATION OF REPRESSION AND BLAMED THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES FOR THE MURDER OF 10 UNION MEMBERS IN A DYNAMITE ATTACK IN SAN SALVADOR ON 31 OCTOBER AND FOR OTHER ATTACKS ON HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND LEFTIST POLITICIANS. GUILLERMO ROJAS, LEADER OF THE NATIONAL UNITY OF SALVADORAN WORKERS , THE MAIN OPPOSITION LABOR UNION, TERMED THE DIALOGUE SUSPENSION AS "LOGICAL." ROJAS SAID CRISTIANI HAS GIVEN NO INDICATIONS HE INDEED WANTS PEACE; QUITE THE CONTRARY, HE HAS "DECLARED WAR ON THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE BY ORDERING ATTACKS ON LABOR UNION HEADQUARTERS." MEANWHILE, ARONETTE DIAZ, PRESIDENT OF THE LEFTIST NATIONALIST DEMOCRATIC UNION , SAID THE CURRENT SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR IS WORRISOME BECAUSE "IT CANNOT TAKE ANY MORE VIOLENCE THAN IT IS ALREADY ENDURING." "THE ONLY THING LEFT IS FOR TANKS TO BE DEPLOYED TO MACHINEGUN ALL OF US," SHE ADDED.
DEV-MUC3-0106	SAN SALVADOR, 3 NOV 89 -- LEADERS OF THE MAIN OPPOSITION LABOR UNIONS IN EL SALVADOR TODAY VOICED SUPPORT FOR THE GUERRILLAS' DECISION TO SUSPEND DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT UNTIL IT COMMITS ITSELF TO GUARANTEEING THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE MEMBERS OF THE PEOPLE'S ORGANIZATIONS. THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS DECIDED TO SUSPEND THE DIALOGUE PROCESS WITH THE GOVERNMENT FOLLOWING THE 31 OCTOBER DYNAMITE ATTACK THAT LEFT 10 DEAD AND 30 WOUNDED, AND ALSO DEMANDED THAT THE UNITED NATIONS, THE OAS, AND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH PROVIDE "GUARANTEES FOR THE OPPOSITION ORGANIZATIONS." THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT DECISION COINCIDED WITH THE BURIAL OF THE 10 UNION LEADERS KILLED IN THE BOMB EXPLOSION AT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE OPPOSITION SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION . IN A COMMUNIQUE THE FMLN INSISTED THAT THE DYNAMITE ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS "WAS PLANNED BY COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, APPROVED BY THE PRESIDENT , AND CARRIED OUT BY COLONEL ELENA FUENTES." IN THE COMMUNIQUE SIGNED BY ITS TOP FIVE COMMANDERS, THE FMLN ADDED THAT "WE MUST PREVENT OUR PRESENCE IN THE DIALOGUE FROM BEING USED TO COVER UP THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS SLAUGHTER." HUMBERTO CENTENO, LEADER OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF SALVADORAN WORKERS , WHICH CLAIMS TO HAVE A MEMBERSHIP OF 200,000 PERSONS, SAID THAT "THIS IS A LOGICAL AND CORRECT DECISION BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECLARED WAR ON THE WORKERS AND NOT ON THE FMLN." ORLANDO AREVALO, LEADER OF THE NATIONAL PEASANT WORKERS UNITY--OF A CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC TREND--WONDERED IF IT WAS WORTH IT FOR THE MARXIST GUERRILLAS TO HOLD A DIALOGUE WITH THE RIGHTIST GOVERNMENT WHILE "THE PEOPLE ARE BEING MURDERED." POLITICAL LEADERS OF SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC AND CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC LEANINGS VOICED THEIR CONCERN OVER THE SUSPENSION OF THE PEACE TALKS AND COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO CONTACTING THE FMLN LEADERS TO MAKE THEM RECONSIDER NOT ATTENDING THE THIRD ROUND OF THE DIALOGUE THAT WAS SLATED FOR 20 AND 21 NOVEMBER IN CARACAS . EDGAR PALACIOS, COORDINATOR OF THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE FOR THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE , REGRETTED THE FMLN'S DECISION AND WARNED THAT "WHEN THE DOORS TO DIALOGUE ARE CLOSED, THE DOORS TO WAR ARE OPENED." SEVERAL OPPOSITION LEADERS POINTED OUT THAT THE SUSPENSION OF THE TALKS WILL WORSEN THE WAR AND WILL BRING MORE BLOODSHED, BUT HIS OPINION WAS NOT SHARED BY THE WORKERS, WHO STATED THEY ARE "VICTIMS OF AN OPEN WAR BY THE GOVERNMENT." CENTENO ADDED: "WHAT MORE WILL HAPPEN? THE ONLY THING MISSING IS FOR THE TANKS TO ROLL DOWN THE STREETS AGAINST US. WE HAVE BEEN ATTACKED, AND WE--THE WORKERS--HAVE NOT MURDERED ANYONE. WE HAVE PARTICIPATED IN POLITICAL DEBATES AND DEMAND THAT THE GOVERNMENT MEET OUR BASIC NEEDS." THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN BEGAN A DIALOGUE IN SEPTEMBER IN MEXICO. IN THE FIRST MEETING, THEY AGREED TO MEET IN COSTA RICA IN OCTOBER TO DRAFT A CEASE-FIRE THAT WILL END AN INTERNAL WAR THAT HAS LEFT OVER 70,000 DEAD IN 9 YEARS.
DEV-MUC3-0107	SAN SALVADOR, 3 NOV 89 -- RELIGIOUS, POLITICAL, AND UNION LEADERS HEADED THE FUNERAL MARCH OF THE 10 UNION MEMBERS KILLED IN THE DYNAMITE ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS HEADQUARTERS, LOCATED IN THE CENTER OF SAN SALVADOR, ONLY 200 METERS FROM THE POLICE HEADQUARTERS. THE UNION MEMBERS' BODIES, INCLUDING FENASTRAS LEADER FEDE ELIZABETH VELASQUEZ, WERE ACCOMPANIED BY SEVERAL THOUSAND WORKERS WHO SHOUTED ANTIGOVERNMENT SLOGANS AND CARRIED RED FLOWERS. THE MARCH TOOK PLACE AMIDST MUCH TENSION BECAUSE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF MILITARY TROOPS IN SAN SALVADOR'S MAIN STREETS AND BECAUSE UNION MEMBERS STOPPED AT LEAST 30 POLICEMEN DRESSED IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES WHO, ACCORDING TO THE UNIONISTS, HAD INFILTRATED THE DEMONSTRATION. THE MARCH ENDED AT THE LA BERMEJA CEMETERY, WHERE THE UNION MEMBERS' BODIES WERE BURIED.
DEV-MUC3-0108	SAN SALVADOR, 1 NOV 89 -- COLONEL MAURICIO ERNESTO VARGAS, COMMANDER OF THE 3RD INFANTRY BRIGADE, REPORTED ON 31 OCTOBER THAT BETWEEN JANUARY AND SEPTEMBER, THE ARMY HAD INFLICTED 800 CASUALTIES ON THE FMLN AND SEIZED 300 WEAPONS IN THE EASTERN AREA OF THE COUNTRY. COL VARGAS ADDED THAT THE ARMY SUFFERED 443 CASUALTIES DURING THE SAME PERIOD. THE MILITARY COMMANDER OF THE AREA ADDED THAT 393 GUERRILLAS WERE KILLED AND 310 WOUNDED IN MORE THAN 600 CLASHES AND THAT 143 SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AND 300 WOUNDED. "QUALITATIVE CHANGES HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE 3RD INFANTRY BRIGADE SINCE 1984, WHEN THE FMLN CHANGED ITS OVERALL STRATEGY FROM SEIZING POWER BY MILITARY MEANS TO THE EXTENDED PEOPLE'S WAR WHOSE BASIC ELEMENT IS THE UPRISING OF THE MASSES," COL VARGAS SAID. VARGAS ADDED THAT DESPITE REBEL ACTIONS, THE ARMED FORCES HAVE CARRIED OUT THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANS AND ARE PROMOTING THE "EASTERN 89" PLAN IN 18 MUNICIPALITIES WITH 40 MILLION COLONS TO COVER THE COLLECTIVE AND INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE. THEY ARE PREPARING A SECOND PHASE OF THE PLAN, WHICH WILL INCLUDE THE OTHER THREE DEPARTMENTS. VARGAS ALSO REPORTED THAT, BECAUSE 30 PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY'S COFFEE IS GROWN IN THE EASTERN SECTOR OF THE COUNTRY, THE ARMY IS CARRYING OUT COMBING OPERATIONS TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF THE AREA DURING THE COFFEE HARVEST. REGARDING THE GOVERNMENT - FMLN DIALOGUE HELD IN COSTA RICA, WHICH HE ATTENDED AS ADVISOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION, VARGAS SAID THE ARMED FORCES CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT'S DEMOCRATIC NATURE. "THERE IS SOMEONE WHO IS TRYING TO HINDER THE DIALOGUE AND PEACE. WE REJECT ALL CHARGES OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE RECENT ACTS OF VIOLENCE AND ATTACKS AND PUBLICLY REITERATE OUR TOTAL SUPPORT FOR THE COUNTRY'S PEACE PROCESS," VARGAS ADDED.
DEV-MUC3-0109	QUITO, 8 MAR 89 -- THE ECUADORAN INSURGENT GROUP "FREE HOMELAND MONTONEROS" TODAY REITERATED THAT IT WILL NOT ABANDON ITS ARMED STRUGGLE. IT MADE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT 1 DAY AFTER THE "ALFARO LIVES, DAMNIT" GROUP SIGNED A PEACE AGREEMENT WITH PRESIDENT RODRIGO BORJA'S GOVERNMENT. THE MPL TODAY EXPRESSED ITS DETERMINATION TO CONTINUE ITS ARMED STRUGGLE AND NOT TO FOLLOW THE AVC'S FOOTSTEPS. AVC LEADERS AND TWO ECUADORAN MINISTERS YESTERDAY APPEARED BEFORE THE MEDIA TO FORMALIZE THE PEACE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE AVC AND THE GOVERNMENT. IN A COMMUNIQUE RELEASED TO EFE, THE MPL STATES THAT IT WILL NOW BRANDISH ITS WEAPONS "WITH GREATER FORCE TO ATTAIN FREEDOM FOR ECUADORAN SOCIETY AND ITS PEOPLE." THE MPL COMMUNIQUE CALLS UPON ECUADOREANS "TO STRENGTHEN THE PEOPLE'S POWER, TO PREPARE TO SEIZE POLITICAL POWER THROUGH ORGANIZATION AND STRUGGLE UNTIL THE BOURGEOISIE AND IMPERIALISM ARE DEFEATED, AND TO PROMOTE REVOLUTIONARY UNITY IN THE STREETS, FIELDS, AND MOUNTAINS." THE MPL ACCUSES THE BORJA ADMINISTRATION OF ADDING TO THE PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS BY AUTHORIZING NEW INCREASES FOR BASIC STAPLES AND BY "CONTINUING TO VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS." ACCORDING TO THE MPL, THERE HAVE BEEN 4 MURDERS, 9 CASES OF TORTURE, 8 CASES OF DISAPPEARANCES, AND 25 ARBITRARY ARRESTS SINCE BORJA ROSE TO POWER LAST 10 AUGUST. MEANWHILE, THE GROUP ADDED, "THE ACTIONS OF PARAMILITARY SQUADS CONTINUE WITH IMPUNITY." THE GROUP, WHICH BECAME ACTIVE ON 22 JANUARY 1986, SAID IT IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT "THE INDIFFERENCE OF THE INSTITUTIONAL LEFT WING, WHICH CANNOT SURMOUNT THE PARLIAMENTARY LIMITS IMPOSED BY THE SYSTEM."
DEV-MUC3-0110	LIMA, 9 MAR 89 -- DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE ATTENDED BY FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS, PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA SAID HERE TODAY THAT HE SUPPORTS THE CONSTRUCTION "OF NOT ONE BUT FIVE" INTERNATIONAL HIGHWAYS IN THE AMAZONIAN REGION. ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, THE UNITED STATES PRESSURED JAPAN NOT TO PROVIDE FINANCING FOR THE BRAZILIAN-PERUVIAN PROJECT. GARCIA SAID HE WAS NOT AWARE THAT U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH HAD HELD TALKS WITH THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT AT HIROHITO'S FUNERAL TO PREVENT THE FINANCING OF THE HIGHWAY. SOME REPORTS SAID THAT BUSH HAD HELD TALKS WITH JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER NOBORU TAKESHITA ON THE NEED TO PRESERVE THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT, ESPECIALLY THE AMAZON REGION, WHICH IS CONSIDERED THE "WORLD'S LUNGS." THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT SAID: "PRESIDENT BUSH IS A POLITICIAN WITH WIDE EXPERIENCE. I DO NOT BELIEVE HE SAID SUCH A THING. IF HE DID SAY IT, IT WOULD BE VERY SERIOUS, BECAUSE HE WOULD BE INTERVENING IN OUR DOMESTIC AFFAIRS." BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT JOSE SARNEY RECENTLY SAID THAT THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL HIGHWAY IS "A MATTER OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY." BRAZIL AND PERU ARE SPONSORING A PROJECT TO BUILD A HIGHWAY THROUGH THE AMAZON REGION TO JOIN THE BRAZILIAN NORTHWESTERN STATE OF ACRE AND THE PACIFIC OCEAN. BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE ASKED FOR JAPAN'S FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE PROJECT. IN PRACTICE, THE OBJECTIVE IS TO ESTABLISH A LAND CORRIDOR BETWEEN THE ATLANTIC AND PACIFIC OCEANS--AN OLD PROJECT OF THE BRAZILIAN MILITARY GEOSTRATEGISTS. THE BRAZILIAN MILITARY MINISTERS SUPPORTED SARNEY'S POSITION BY ANNOUNCING THAT THEY WILL NOT ACCEPT "ANY TYPE OF FOREIGN FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN THE AMAZON REGION" AND THAT THEY REJECTED AS "UNACCEPTABLE" THE ATTEMPTS TO LINK THE FOREIGN DEBT WITH INVESTMENTS TO PRESERVE THE AMAZON FOREST. GARCIA INDICATED THAT IF THE UNITED STATES WANTS TO HELP PRESERVE THE ECOLOGICAL BALANCE, IT SHOULD "SPEED UP DISARMAMENT TALKS WITH THE SOVIET UNION." HE ADDED THAT "THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT THE AMAZON REGION IS TO ELIMINATE DEADLY WEAPONS AND NUCLEAR BOMBS." GARCIA THEN REITERATED: "I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT PRESIDENT BUSH HAS SAID THAT, BUT IF HE SAID IT, I BELIEVE THAT IT IS A SERIOUS MATTER AND HE SHOULD GIVE US A CONCRETE OPINION." GARCIA DEFENDED RELATIONS WITH BRAZIL BY SAYING: "I BELIEVE FORTIFYING ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND GEOGRAPHIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES IS A NATIONAL OBJECTIVE." THEN HE ADDED: "BRAZIL IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST IMPORTANT COUNTRIES, AND PERU HAS WRONGLY LIVED IN FEAR OF BRAZIL. LET US HOPE THAT NOT ONE BUT FIVE HIGHWAYS ARE BUILT THROUGH THE AMAZON REGION." SIXTY PERCENT OF PERU'S 1.3 MILLION SQUARE KILOMETERS LIE IN THE AMAZON REGION. THAT MAKES UP NEARLY ONE-FIFTH OF THE ENTIRE AMAZON BASIN.
DEV-MUC3-0111	TEGUCIGALPA, 1 NOV 89 -- THE HONDURAN HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENSE COMMITTEE SAID TODAY THAT VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS GUARANTEES CONTINUE IN THIS COUNTRY AND DENOUNCED SUMMARY EXECUTIONS, POLITICAL ASSASSINATIONS, AND INTIMIDATORY CAMPAIGNS AGAINST PEOPLE'S LEADERS. CODEH PRESIDENT RAMON CUSTODIO ISSUED A DOCUMENT ACCUSING STATE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS OF BEING LINKED TO A SERIES OF CRIMINAL ACTS. CODEH STRESSED THAT THE MILITARY UNIT IN CHARGE OF "REPRESSION IS BATTALION 3-16, LED BY COLONEL ALBERTO ANDINO BENITEZ." BATTALION 3-16 WAS CREATED IN 1982 AS AN INTELLIGENCE UNIT AND HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF ENCOURAGING THE MURDER AND KIDNAPPING OF OPPOSITION POLITICIANS. THIS VERSION WAS REJECTED BY THE ARMED FORCES, WHO INSIST THAT THE "3-16" WAS ABOLISHED MORE THAN 2 YEARS AGO. CODEH SAYS THAT IN HONDURAS, "FACTS PROVE THAT VIOLATIONS TO HUMAN RIGHTS ARE SERIOUS AND THAT THE AUTHORITIES IN CHARGE OF INVESTIGATING AND SANCTIONING THEM PUBLICLY DECLARE THEIR LACK OF RESOLVE AND ABILITY TO DO SO." ACCORDING TO CODEH'S VERSION, IN HONDURAS OVER THE PAST 9 YEARS, MORE THAN 140 PEOPLE HAVE DISAPPEARED AND ABOUT 60 HAVE BEEN KILLED FOR POLITICAL REASONS.
DEV-MUC3-0112	LIMA, 11 MAR 89 -- IT WAS OFFICIALLY REPORTED TODAY THAT ON 10 MARCH ALLEGED SHINING PATH MEMBERS MURDERED FOUR MEMBERS OF A FAMILY IN SANTA MARIA DEL VALLE, HUANUCO DEPARTMENT.

DEV-MUC3-0113	BOGOTA, 26 OCT 89 -- DRUG TRAFFICKER JOSE GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, AKA "THE MEXICAN," HAS DENIED HE REQUESTED, THROUGH A LETTER, AN ALLIANCE WITH THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA . THIS WAS STATED IN A LETTER ADDRESSED TO LA PRENSA DIRECTOR JUAN CARLOS PASTRANA. RODRIGUEZ GACHA SENT COPIES OF THIS LETTER TO ALL MEDIA. THE TEXT OF THE LETTER FOLLOWS: MR PASTRANA: AN ARTICLE ON PAGE 1 OF YOUR 19 OCTOBER NEWSPAPER MAINTAINS THAT VERY RELIABLE SOURCES HAD DISCLOSED THAT JOSE GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA SENT A MESSAGE TO THE FARC LEADERS LAST WEEK PROPOSING AN ALLIANCE WITH THAT SUBVERSIVE GROUP. THE TRUTH IS THAT SUCH A LETTER DOES NOT EXIST AND THAT I HAVE SENT NO MESSAGE TO ANY OF THE PEOPLE MENTIONED IN YOUR NEWSPAPER. HOWEVER, THE WORST PART OF THIS IS THAT THE EVIL INTENTION OF THE ALLEGED WRITERS OF THE LETTER REACHES THE LIMIT BECAUSE THEY PORTRAY ME AS THE SELF-CONFESSED CULPRIT OF ALL CRIMES PERPETRATED AGAINST UP LEADERS. IT IS TRUE I WAS ACCUSED OF THE PARDO LEAL ASSASSINATION. HOWEVER, THE COURTS HAVE ALREADY ISSUED A VERDICT OF NOT GUILTY. NO MAN HAS EVER BEEN PURSUED IN COLOMBIA WITH SUCH MALICE. IT SEEMS THAT THE ENTIRE PENAL CODE HAS FALLEN UPON ME, WHILE MY OPPONENTS ARE COMPLETELY IGNORED. REGARDING THE REST OF THE LETTER, IT DOES NOT EVEN DESERVE MENTIONING BECAUSE SUCH A LETTER DOES NOT EXIST. THEREFORE, EVERYTHING IS FALSE. MOREOVER, ALL SECTORS ARE FULLY AWARE OF MY PRINCIPLES AND MY STRUGGLE TOWARD THE SO-CALLED FARC GROUPS. I CLEARLY WANT TO STRESS MY AGREEMENT WITH THE PROPOSALS MADE BY THE M-19 , ESPECIALLY THOSE DEALING WITH CEASING OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS AGAINST THE ARMED FORCES AND THE DEFINITE LAYING DOWN OF WEAPONS. THESE ARE THE FIRST STEPS TOWARD MAKING COLOMBIA SIT AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE, WITH NO EXCLUSIONS. THIS IS MY POSITION, AND THIS IS THE TRUTH. I AM AWARE THAT THE MISSION OF EACH ONE OF YOU, AS COLOMBIANS, IS TO BRING PEACE BACK TO COLOMBIA. YOURS FAITHFULLY, JOSE GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA
DEV-MUC3-0114	BOGOTA, 2 NOV 89 -- WHAT BEGAN AS A SEARCH FOR A WEAPONS CACHE BECAME A MYSTERY THAT WOULD RIVAL ANY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES' STORIES. IN A HOUSE LOCATED 1 KM FROM TENJO, NORTH OF BOGOTA, 13TH BRIGADE MEMBERS TODAY FOUND A GRAVE CONTAINING THE BODIES OF TWO WOMEN WHO WERE BURIED MORE THAN 3 MONTHS AGO. THE HOUSE WAS RENTED IN 1987 BY LUIS EMILIO ESPINA, ALSO KNOWN AS GONZALO ROJAS, WHO WAS KILLED 1 WEEK AGO. SOURCES IN THE 13TH BRIGADE LINK HIM AND HIS LOAN GUARANTOR, ERNESTO VELEZ, WHO WAS KILLED ON THE GUAYMARAL HIGHWAY 6 WEEKS AGO, TO THE MEDELLIN CARTEL. THE HOUSE IS ON THE PERU FARM, WHICH ADJOINS THE CHIGUACHI ESTATE BELONGING TO GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND CAMILO ZAPATA, WHO ALSO OWNS THE FAMOUS MARROQUIN CASTLE. ACCORDING TO A HIGH-RANKING INFANTRY SCHOOL OFFICER, THIS IS THE SAME HOUSE WHERE ANDRES PASTRANA WAS HELD WHEN HE WAS KIDNAPPED. THE PERSON LEASING THE PROPERTY DISAPPEARED AFTER THE ASSASSINATION OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN, AND SINCE THEN 10 OTHER PEOPLE WHO USED TO FREQUENT THE FARM HAVE BEEN MYSTERIOUSLY KILLED.
DEV-MUC3-0115	BOGOTA, 3 NOV 89 -- ARMY AND NATIONAL POLICE TROOPS ARE CONDUCTING OPERATIONS IN THE RURAL AREA OF EL PENON MUNICIPALITY, CUNDINAMARCA DEPARTMENT, TO PURSUE THE ARMED GROUP THAT KILLED FIVE PEASANTS IN THE AREA. THE PEASANTS' CORPSES WERE FOUND RIDDLED WITH BULLETS. ACCORDING TO REPORTS BY THE AUTHORITIES, THE CORPSES OF THE FIVE PEASANTS WERE FOUND ON THE VILLAGE OUTSKIRTS. SOME REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE PEASANTS WERE KILLED BY ALLEGED MEMBERS OF THE XXII FRONT OF THE FARC OPERATING IN THIS SECTOR. THE VICTIMS WERE IDENTIFIED AS JOSE MANUEL JIMENEZ RIVERA, PEDRO RAFAEL JIMENEZ CORTEZ, JOSE LACIDES ORDONEZ, JOSE ISAAC FORERO LINARES, AND PEDRO RAFAEL ORDONEZ.
DEV-MUC3-0116	BOGOTA, 3 NOV 89 -- FOUR PEOPLE KILLED, FIVE INJURED, AND LOSSES ESTIMATED TO BE IN THE MILLIONS ARE THE RESULT OF A CAR BOMB EXPLOSION IN BOGOTA, THE POLICE REPORTED TO RADIO CADENA NACIONAL. THE CAR BOMB WAS LEFT UNDER THE BRIDGE ON 68TH STREET AND 13TH STREET WHERE IT EXPLODED AT APPROXIMATELY 1100, KILLING MARIA JACINTA PULIDO, 42; PILAR PULIDO, 19; A MINOR REPORTEDLY KNOWN AS CARLOS; EFRAIN RINCON RODRIGUEZ, AND A POLICE OFFICIAL WHO DIED AT THE POLICE CLINIC.

HOWEVER, WHEN THE BOMB EXPLODED THE VEHICLE WAS USING LICENCE PLATES NO IC-9394. THE REMOVAL OF THE CORPSES WAS SUPERVISED BY 3D DISTRICT JUDGE JAIME BERNARDO CHAVEZ BOLANOS. THE BLAST DAMAGED SHOWCASES OF AT LEAST 30 STORES AND DESTROYED SOME 20 FOOD STANDS. ALTHOUGH THE BOMB EXPLODED UNDER THE BRIDGE, IT WAS NOT SERIOUSLY DAMAGED AND SUSPENSION OF TRAFFIC WAS UNNECESSARY.
DEV-MUC3-0117	SANTA FE , 4 MAY 88 -- TWO MEDIUM-SIZED BOMBS EXPLODED EARLY THIS MORNING AT THE HOUSE OF JUDGE GUILLERMO TORRE ALDAY AND AT THE OFFICES OF LAWYER LUIS ROSSMAN, A FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE SANTA FE PROVINCIAL BANK. THE EXPLOSIONS CAUSED SOME DAMAGE, BUT NO CASUALTIES. JUDGE RAMIRO PUYOL IS CARRYING OUT THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE TWO CASES, BUT SO FAR THERE HAVE BEEN NO POSITIVE RESULTS. THE TWO BOMBS EXPLODED ONLY MINUTES APART AND CAUSED MINOR DAMAGE TO THE WALLS OF THE TWO PREMISES. THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES. ACCORDING TO SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE BOMB SQUAD OF THE LOCAL POLICE, THE TWO BOMBS WERE PLANTED WITH THE EXCLUSIVE PURPOSE OF INTIMIDATING THE OWNERS OF THE PREMISES. THIS AFTERNOON SOURCES CLOSE TO THE INVESTIGATION ANNOUNCED THAT BOTH ATTACKS HAD THE INTENTION OF "FRIGHTENING" TORRE ALDAY AND ROSSMAN, WHO WAS DIRECTOR OF THE PROVINCIAL BANK OF SANTA FE DURING GOVERNOR JOSE VERNET'S TENURE. IT HAS BEEN LEARNED THAT BOTH TORRE ALDAY AND ROSSMAN ARE LINKED TO THE BANKRUPTCY CASES OF SOME LOCAL ENTERPRISES. THEREFORE, IT IS THOUGHT THAT THE ATTACKS HAD THE INTENTION OF INTIMIDATING BOTH MEN. JUDGE PUYOL IMMEDIATELY BEGAN HIS INVESTIGATION INTO THE TWO CASES, WHICH, ACCORDING TO SOME MEMBERS OF THE BOMB SQUAD, "DO NOT HAVE ANY POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS."
DEV-MUC3-0118	GUATEMALA CITY, 20 MAY 88 -- GUATEMALA'S CLANDESTINE ORGANIZATION "SECRET ANTICOMMUNIST ARMY" HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR WEDNESDAY'S TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST THE RESIDENCE AND OFFICE OF ALEKSANDR TRUSHIN, TASS CORRESPONDENT IN GUATEMALA. AN ESA BULLETIN DISTRIBUTED TO THE NEWS MEDIA STATES THAT THE ATTACK AGAINST THE SOVIET NEWS AGENCY "WAS TO EXPRESS REJECTION OF THE SOCIALIST-LEANING MEASURES" ADOPTED BY THE VINICIO CEREZO AREVALO GOVERNMENT. THE DOCUMENT EXPLAINS THAT "THIS IS A WARNING," BECAUSE IF ARREST WARRANTS ARE ISSUED FOR THE FIVE CIVILIANS INVOLVED IN THE ABORTIVE 11 MAY COUP, "ACTIONS WILL BE UNDERTAKEN AGAINST MEMBERS OF THE GUATEMALAN CHRISTIAN DEMOCRACY," WHICH IS THE RULING PARTY. THE ATTACK, CARRIED OUT WITH TWO BOMBS, WAS PERPETRATED AGAINST THE SOVIET NEWSMAN'S HOME, LOCATED IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA SOUTH OF THIS CITY. THIS OCCURRED ON 18 MAY. THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES WERE HURLED FROM AN AUTOMOBILE. IT DESTROYED AN ENTRANCE AND WINDOWS OF THE HOME AS WELL AS TRUSHIN'S CAR. HOWEVER, NEITHER TRUSHIN NOR HIS WIFE WERE INJURED. THE COMMUNIQUE BY ESA, A PARAMILITARY ORGANIZATION THAT EMERGED IN THE 1960'S, ADDS THAT IT "WILL NOT REST UNTIL THE COMMUNIST AGGRESSION HAS BEEN STOPPED AND ITS DEFEAT ACHIEVED." IT ALSO SAYS THAT "THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT IS PROMOTING REVOLUTION. IF IT WANTS WAR, IT WILL HAVE WAR BECAUSE WE ARE READY TO DIE AND TO FIGHT AGAINST COMMUNISM ANY TIME." THE DOCUMENT, SIGNED BY COMMANDERS "UBICO TOROKZIK" AND "RAFAEL NETANAGIUHI," SAYS THAT DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL HECTOR GRAMEJO, FOREIGN MINISTER ALFONSO CABRERA, AND PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO AREVALO PLANNED THE COUP. ACCORDING TO THIS COMMUNIQUE, IN THE RECENT TRIP TO CUBA BY RAQUEL BLANDON, WIFE OF PRESIDENT CEREZO AREVALO, SHE MET WITH LIBYAN AHMAD MUSTAFA "TO ASK HIM FOR ECONOMIC SUPPORT FOR THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTIONS IN 1990." ESA IS OPPOSED TO THE ISSUANCE OF ARREST WARRANTS AGAINST MARIO DAVID GARCIA, DANILO ROCA, NICOLAS BUONAFINA, GUSTAVO ANZUETO VIELMAN, AND MARIO CASTEJON. THESE ARE THE CIVILIANS WHOM THE CEREZO AREVALO GOVERNMENT HAS ACCUSED OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE COUP ATTEMPT. THIS GROUP STRESSES THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS A "PLOY PROMOTED BY GEN HECTOR GRAMEJO. THAT IS THE BASEST THING THAT THE DEFENSE MINISTER COULD HAVE DONE: TO SELL HIMSELF AND HIS MILITARY COLLEAGUES." ESA MEMBERS DESCRIBE THEMSELVES AS "GUATEMALA'S PROGRESSIVE PATRIOTS," AND THEY REAFFIRM THAT THE ATTACK ON THE TASS MISSION "WAS A WARNING."
DEV-MUC3-0119	PRAGUE , 21 MAY 88 -- THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO CARRY OUT A "CONSTITUTIONAL COUP" TO CONSIST OF TRANSFERRING PART OF ITS POWER TO THE ARMED FORCES TO PHYSICALLY ELIMINATE PROGRESSIVE SECTORS, COLOMBIAN PATRIOTIC UNION LEADER BERNARDO JARAMILLO TOLD THE MEDIA. ACCORDING TO REPORTS BY THE OFFICIAL CTK PRESS AGENCY, JARAMILLO SAID THAT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS NOT HELPING THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT IN THIS ATTEMPT TO TRANSFER POWER, AS IS EVIDENT IN THE FACT THAT IT HAS REJECTED SEVERAL PRESIDENTIAL DECREES THAT STRESS THE CURRENT STATE OF SIEGE NORMS THAT HAVE BEEN IN EFFECT IN COLOMBIA SINCE 1948. JARAMILLO CHARGED THE GOVERNMENT WITH "LACKING THE POLITICAL WILLINGNESS" TO HALT THE MURDER OF ACTIVISTS AND POLITICAL AND LABOR LEADERS AND THE MASSIVE MURDER OF PEASANTS, AS WELL AS TO PURGE ARMY MEMBERS "CLEARLY COMMITTED TO THESE CRIMES AND TO DRUG TRAFFICKING, AS CONFIRMED BY THE COLOMBIAN ATTORNEY GENERAL." "THE LINKS BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS OR NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENTS WITH THE NARCOTRAFFICKERS PROVIDES THE UNITED STATES WITH A PRETEXT TO MEDDLE IN LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS, AS WAS CLEARLY EVIDENT RECENTLY IN PANAMA," JARAMILLO ADDED. THE VISIT TO PRAGUE OF JARAMILLO AND THE ACCOMPANYING DELEGATION IS PART OF A EUROPEAN TOUR, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE RESOLUTION APPROVED IN APRIL DURING THE 7TH UP NATIONAL PLENUM THAT SOUGHT TO PROMOTE THE PARTY'S PRESENCE ABROAD.

DEV-MUC3-0121	SAN SALVADOR, 15 MAR 89 -- WE INFORM THE WORKING CLASS, STUDENTS, AND SALVADORAN PEOPLE IN GENERAL: AS OF 16 MARCH, THE DATE SET BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT TO BEGIN ITS NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE, ALL OUR MILITIA UNITS WILL BE IN FIGHTING SPIRITS AND WILL ATTACK TRANSPORTATION VEHICLES SUCH AS TAXIS, MINIBUSES, PICKUP TRUCKS, GOVERNMENT VEHICLES, BUSES, , AND ALL VEHICLES THAT DO NOT ABIDE BY THE STOPPAGE. WE WILL BURN AND BLOW UP VEHICLES. WE WARN THE POPULATION NOT TO RIDE MILITARY VEHICLES, BECAUSE THEY WILL BE AMBUSHED. IN EMERGENCY CASES AT NIGHT OR EARLY IN THE MORNING, PEOPLE SHOULD RIDE PRIVATE OR FIRST-AID VEHICLES AND SHOULD DISPLAY A WHITE FLAG. WE ALSO URGE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE NOT TO VOTE, BECAUSE THAT VOTE WILL CONTRIBUTE TO WORSEN THE WAR AND WILL SUPPORT THE COUNTERINSURGENCY PLAN OF THE YANKEE IMPERIALISTS' AND THEIR SERVILE LOCAL AUTHORITIES. IT HAS BEEN PROVED THAT NEITHER THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY NOR THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE WANT A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE WAR. IN RESPONSE TO THEIR REFUSAL, LET US NOT VOTE IN THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS; LET US VOTE IN THE 15 SEPTEMBER ELECTIONS. THAT MUST BE THE PEOPLE'S RESPONSE TO THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS. THE BALLOT BOXES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE WILL BE SABOTAGED, AND PERSONNEL PARTICIPATING IN THAT ELECTION GAME WILL BE SUBSEQUENTLY ANNIHILATED, BECAUSE THEIR PARTICIPATION MEANS THEY AGREE WITH THE ELECTIONS AND SUPPORT THE WORSENING OF THE WAR. NO TO THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS, BECAUSE THEY ARE A DEMAGOGIC AND FRAUDULENT MANEUVER AND BECAUSE THEY ARE A DENIAL OF PEACE.
DEV-MUC3-0122	SAN SALVADOR, 15 MAR 89 -- THIS MORNING, JUST 4 DAYS BEFORE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, GUERRILLAS STAGED A 6-HOUR ATTACK ON SEVERAL MILITARY INSTALLATIONS IN THE NORTHERN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT. RADIO FARABUNDO MARTI, A GUERRILLA RADIO STATION, CLAIMED THAT DURING ONE OF THE ATTACKS, IN THE TOWN OF TEJUTLA, 13 ARMY SOLDIERS WERE EITHER KILLED OR WOUNDED. IN A PRELIMINARY REPORT, THE ARMY ADMITTED TO ONLY 3 SOLDIERS WOUNDED, AND SAID THAT 3 GUERRILLAS HAD BEEN KILLED AND SOME 20 OTHERS INJURED. THE MAIN ATTACK, WITH MORTAR AND RIFLES OF VARIOUS CALIBERS, WAS LAUNCHED AT THE INSTALLATIONS OF MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 1, IN THE CENTRAL PART OF CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT.
DEV-MUC3-0123	SANTIAGO, 14 MAR 89 -- AGRICULTURE MINISTER JAIME DE LA SOTTA AND FOREIGN MINISTER HERNAN FELIPE ERRAZURIZ WILL LEAVE TONIGHT FOR THE UNITED STATES IN AN ATTEMPT TO ACHIEVE THE LIFTING OF THE BAN ON IMPORTED CHILEAN FRUITS. THEY WILL TAKE LAN-CHILE FLIGHT 141 THAT DEPARTS AT APPROXIMATELY 2100 FROM SANTIAGO AND GOES DIRECTLY TO NEW YORK. IN NEW YORK, THE TWO MINISTERS WILL TAKE ANOTHER PLANE TO WASHINGTON AND WILL ARRIVE AT APPROXIMATELY NOON TOMORROW. IN THE U.S. CAPITAL THEY WILL MEET WITH OFFICIALS OF THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE TRIP IS TO ACHIEVE THE LIFTING OF THE BAN ON IMPORTED CHILEAN FRUITS. U.S. OFFICIALS ANNOUNCED THE BAN OVER AN UNUSUAL TELEVISION NETWORK FOLLOWING THE DISCOVERY THAT SOME CHILEAN GRAPES WERE LACED CYANIDE. DE LA SOTTA STATED THAT THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE DAMAGE THAT TERRORISM CAN CAUSE. YOU CAN SEE AND MEASURE THE SCOPE OF A TERRORIST ACT SUCH AS THE ONE WE HAVE JUST EXPERIENCED, THE SOLE OBJECTIVE OF WHICH IS TO CAUSE HARM. THIS CAN BE DEMONSTRATED BY THE ADVERTISEMENT, NOT A CLEAR AND CONCRETE ADVERTISEMENT, BUT AN ANONYMOUS TELEPHONE CALL BY WHICH THEY WARNED US, THAT IS, THEY WARNED THE EMBASSIES THEY CALLED, THAT THEY WOULD CARRY OUT SUCH AN ACT. THIS CALL WAS MADE 3 DAYS AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THE FRUIT SHIPMENT. WE ATTEMPTED TO CONTROL THE SITUATION TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, FOLLOWING TECHNICAL PROCEDURES CONCERNING THE AMOUNT OF SAMPLES TAKEN. THEN WE ANNOUNCED THAT THE SITUATION WAS UNDER CONTROL, THAT IT WAS AN ANOMYOUS CALL AND AS SUCH COULD NOT BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. LATER, IN THE SHIPMENTS THAT ARRIVED IN THE UNITED STATES LAST WEEKEND, THE PRESENCE OF CYANIDE WAS DETECTED IN TWO GRAPES. DE LA SOTTA ADDED THAT ALL POSSIBLE EFFORTS WILL BE MADE TO OVERCOME THE IMPASSE. THE MAJOR PROBLEM NOW INVOLVES THE 17 MILLION BOXES THAT ARRIVED AT THEIR PORTS OF DESTINATION READY FOR DISTRIBUTION. NOW NO ONE KNOWS WHAT TO DO WITH THEM. THERE ARE 7 OR 8 MILLION BOXES MORE BEING SHIPPED TO THE SAME PORTS, AND 3 MILLION BOXES REMAIN IN THE COUNTRY, READY TO BE SHIPPED. DE LA SOTTA SAID THAT THE CYANIDE WAS FOUND IN TWO SINGLE GRAPES. THE ESSENTIAL THING, I BELIEVE, IS THAT THE UNITED STATES CAN ADOPT MEASURES. WE WILL TALK WITH THE HEALTH OFFICIALS TO GIVE THEM THE NECESSARY ASSURANCES SO THEY CAN LIFT THE BAN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. IN ORDER TO FACE THE PROBLEM, THE GOVERNMENT HAS CREATED THREE COMISSIONS TO STUDY THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM, THE AGRICULTURE MINISTER STATED.
DEV-MUC3-0124	SANTIAGO, 14 MAR 89 -- MANUEL FELIU, CHAIRMAN OF THE INDUSTRY AND TRADE CONFEDERATION, HAS ESTIMATED THAT THE LOSSES CAUSED BY THE ACT OF ECONOMIC TERRORISM AGAINST OUR COUNTRY WILL BE MORE THAN $880 MILLION. IT IS THE RESULT OF A TERRORIST BOYCOTT. IT IS THE BEGINNING OF A BOYCOTT. ALL CHILEANS MUST UNITE AGAINST THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE IT AFFECTS ALL OF US, NOT ONLY THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT. WHAT ECONOMIC DAMAGE CAN THIS BOYCOTT CAUSE THE CHILEAN FRUIT INDUSTRY? THE DAMAGE IS ENORMOUS. IT CAN AMOUNT TO MORE THAN $800 MILLION IN EXPENSES BEFORE THE END OF THIS EXPORTING SEASON. THIS HUGE LOSS WILL CREATE ALL TYPES OF PROBLEMS, NOT ONLY FOR THE FARMERS, EXPORTERS, AND FINANCIAL SECTOR, BUT ALSO FOR THE SEA AND AIR TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY, THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, AND ALL SECTORS OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY RELATED TO FRUIT EXPORT ACTIVITIES. IN SHORT, IT CAUSES A SERIES OF HUGE PROBLEMS FOR THE WORKERS, THE BUSINESSMEN, AND ALL PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THOSE EXPORTS IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. FELIU MADE THESE COMMENTS AT THE END OF A VISIT HE MADE TO THE PRODUCTION, TRADE, AND AGRICULTURAL UNIONS TO OFFER HIS SOLIDARITY TO MEMBERS OF THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR.

DEV-MUC3-0128	CLANDESTINE, 15 MAR 89 -- REPORTS FROM SAN SALVADOR INDICATE THAT AT 1910 TONIGHT, 15 MARCH, FIGHTING AND EXPLOSIONS CONTINUED IN VARIOUS NEIGHBORHOODS AND SECTIONS OF THE CITY. FIGHTING IS ESPECIALLY INTENSE IN THE SAN JACINTO NEIGHBORHOOD ON LOS DIPLOMATICOS AVENUE, WHERE A TRAFFIC JAM HAS RESULTED. STRONG EXPLOSIONS HAVE ALSO BEEN HEARD IN THE 15 DE SEPTIEMBRE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND OUR REPORTS INDICATE THAT AT 1910, BARRICADES WERE STILL BURNING AND EXPLOSIONS COULD STILL BE HEARD ON EJERCITO BOULEVARD. BARRICADES AND EXPLOSIONS HAVE ALSO BEEN REPORTED NEAR BANCO CAPITALIZADOR, AND ATTACKS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST POLICE FORCES IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CAPITAL.
DEV-MUC3-0129	CLANDESTINE, 15 MAR 89 -- THE PEACE PROPOSAL PRESENTED BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND SPARKED A DEBATE OF UNPRECEDENTED BROADNESS AND DURATION TO ATTAIN A NATIONAL AGREEMENT TO SOLVE THE CONFLICT. THE PROGRESS ACHIEVED MUST BE INCREASED, STRENGTHENING THE UNITY AND BROAD SUPPORT OF SECTORS THAT ADVOCATE PEACE WITH SOCIAL JUSTICE AND NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE. IN THIS PROCESS, WE HAVE SHOWN FLEXIBILITY TOWARD PROPOSALS PRESENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE POLITICAL PARTIES. NEVERTHELESS, THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY , ARENA , AND THE MILITARY HIGH COMMAND HAVE CLOSED THE DOOR TO THE POSSIBILITY OF HOLDING ELECTIONS WITHOUT WAR, IN CONDITIONS OF CLEANLINESS AND EQUALITY THAT WOULD TURN THEM INTO AN OPPORTUNITY TO SOLVE THE CONFLICT. THEY INSISTED ON HOLDING THE ELECTIONS AS PART OF MILITARY PLAN THAT TRIES TO APPEAR TO BE DEMOCRATIC TO JUSTIFY TO THE U.S. CONGRESS WHY THERE SHOULD BE CONTINUED SHIPMENTS OF WEAPONS AND MORE MILLIONS IN AID. THERE WILL BE NEW ELECTION FRAUD AND DISPUTES BETWEEN THOSE WHO MURDERED MONSIGNOR ROMERO AND MASSACRED 70,000 SALVADORANS, AND THE VORACIOUS CORRUPT DEVOURERS OF MILLIONS WHO HAVE MORTGAGED THE COUNTRY'S SOVEREIGNTY. A FRAUD WILL TAKE PLACE IN A MILITARIZED COUNTRY, WHERE MORE THAN HALF OF THE MUNICIPAL OFFICES ARE NOT FUNCTIONING, AND WHERE THE MILITARY MANIPULATES THE BALLOT BOXES, VOTES, AND RESULTS -- AND THEY WILL DO IT AGAIN, AS THEY HAVE ALWAYS DONE. WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK, WE HAVE THE LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO SUPPORT THE PEOPLE'S FEELINGS AND REJECT THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS, URGING THEM TO FIGHT AND REJECT THE ATTEMPTS TO TURN THE ELECTIONS INTO AN INSTRUMENT TO CONTINUE THE WAR, URGING THEM NOT TO VOTE OR TO VOID THEIR BALLOT. THE ELECTIONS WILL ATTEMPT TO LEGITIMIZE THE WAR, AND THEY WILL BE HELD IN THE MIDST OF A WAR. THE ARMED FORCES WILL BE BOMBING CIVILIANS; THE POLICE WILL BE CAPTURING, TORTURING, AND ASSASSINATING; THE JAILS WILL AGAIN BE FILLED WITH POLITICAL PRISONERS. PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE WILL BE LAUNCHED BY THE MILITARY HIGH COMMAND BY WAVING THE SPECTER OF GENOCIDE OVER THE POPULATION; THIS AMID THE DRAMATIC POVERTY OF THE DEPRIVED MASSES.
DEV-MUC3-0130	SANTIAGO, 16 MAR 89 -- IN THE PRESENCE OF SOME 50 MEMBERS OF THE PARTIES THAT COMPRISE IT, THE CENTER-RIGHT POLITICAL COALITION COALICION POLITICA DE CENTRO DERECHA HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY FORMED. THE CEREMONY, HELD AT THE NATIONAL PARTY HEADQUARTERS IN THE OLD AND VENERABLE FERNANDEZ CONCHA CLUB, WAS PRESIDED OVER BY SERGIO ONOFRE JARPA, PATRICIO PHILLIPS, AND JAIME TORMO. DURING THE CEREMONY, RADICAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY HEAD JAIME TORMO SAID THAT THE THREE PARTIES WILL NOW START ANALYZING THEIR COMMON POSITIONS, UNDER THE EFFECTIVE COORDINATION OF NATIONAL RENEWAL SECRETARY ANDRES ALLAMAND. JORGE MARTINEZ, OF THE NATIONAL PARTY THEN READ A JOINT DECLARATION. THE THREE PARTIES REPORTED THAT ONE OF THEIR GOALS IS TO RESTORE THE MIDDLE CLASS'S DIGNITY AND ITS OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOBS, BECAUSE THIS CLASS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE GREATEST SPONSOR OF NATIONAL INTELLECTUAL, MATERIAL, AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. ANOTHER GOAL IS TO PREVENT THE COALITION FROM BECOMING A SUPER PARTY OR MERGING WITH OTHER PARTIES. THIS COALITION WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST AS SUCH, AND ITS OBJECTIVE IS TO PROMOTE COOPERATION, BOTH AMONG MEMBER PARTIES AND WITH PARTIES THAT MAY WANT TO JOIN THEM IN THE FUTURE. THE FIRST OFFICIAL ACT OF THE CENTER-RIGHT POLITICAL COALITION WAS TO SEND A CABLE TO U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH TO POINT OUT THE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES OF THE MEASURES THE UNITED STATES HAS ADOPTED AGAINST CHILEAN FRUITS. THE CABLE, WHICH WAS READ BY ANDRES ALLAMAND, STATED: IN VIEW OF THE GROUNDLESS AND EXAGGERATED MEASURES TAKEN BY SOME MEMBERS OF YOUR ADMINISTRATION AGAINST CHILEAN FRUIT EXPORTS, WE CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THESE MEASURES WILL RUIN A LARGE SECTOR OF CHILEAN PRIVATE ENTEPRISE, WILL LEAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WORKERS JOBLESS, AND WILL CAUSE A SERIOUS IMBALANCE IN OUR BALANCE OF PAYMENTS. THESE MEASURES WILL SERIOUSLY AFFECT THE GOOD RELATIONS THE CHILEAN PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS HAD WITH THE U.S. PEOPLE, AND THEY WILL DEEPLY INJURE THOSE WHO, LIKE US, DEFEND FREE ECONOMY AND FREE TRADE. MOST SERIOUS, HOWEVER, IS THE FACT THAT THESE MEASURES APPARENTLY REWARD THE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AGAINST CHILE, BECAUSE THEY HELP THE TERRORISTS ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS. THE CABLE ADDS THAT CHILE HAS EARNED JUSTIFIED PRESTIGE AS A SERIOUS AND EFFECTIVE EXPORTER; THAT IT HAS BEEN HONORING ITS FOREIGN DEBT AT A SACRIFICE; AND THAT IT HAS COOPERATED IN SEVERAL PUBLIC WELFARE PROJECTS SPONSORED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. IN VIEW OF ALL THAT, THE COALITION REQUESTS AN URGENT SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM.
DEV-MUC3-0131	TEGUCIGALPA, 13 MAR 89 -- A GUERRILLA UNIT THAT OPERATED IN THE MERENDON MOUNTAIN RANGE, IN THE OMOA HILLS AREA, 100 KM NORTHWEST OF SAN PEDRO SULA ON THE GUATEMALAN BORDER, WAS DISMANTLED OVER THE WEEKEND BY COMBINED NATIONAL ARMY UNITS. MEMBERS OF THE II ARTILLERY BATTALION, SPECIAL TACTICAL BATTALION, II INFANTRY BATTALION, AND III INFANTRY BATTALION PARTICIPATED IN THE OPERATION. ACCORDING TO LOCAL RESIDENTS, THE ARMY CAPTURED EIGHT ALLEGED SUBVERSIVES AND SEIZED SUPPLIES, MILITARY UNIFORMS, AND MARXIST LITERATURE. LA TRIBUNA VISITED CUYAMEL, RIO CHIQUITO, TEGUCIGALPITA, COMAYAGUA, CUYAMELITO, POTRERILLOS, SAN CARLOS, CORINTO, AND QUEBRADA SECA IN CORTES DEPARTMENT, WHERE THE PEOPLE WERE OBVIOUSLY WORRIED BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT EXPLAIN THE MILITARY MOVEMENTS. THE VILLAGES WERE MILITARIZED ON TUESDAY LAST WEEK WHILE SPECIALISTS IN ANTIGUERRILLA TACTICS WERE DEPLOYED TO "COMB" THE LOCAL MOUNTAINS. ACCORDING TO LOCAL RESIDENTS, THE EIGHT ALLEGED GUERRILLA MEMBERS -- WHO WERE CAPTURED AND LATER TAKEN BY HELICOPTER TO THE 105TH INFANTRY BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS IN SAN PEDRO SULA -- REPORTEDLY INCLUDED AN OLD MAN AND A MINOR. THE PEOPLE ADDED THAT STRANGE PEOPLE COME DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINS AT SUNDOWN, REPORTEDLY IN SEARCH OF FOOD. THE PEOPLE STATED THAT SOMEONE TIPPED OFF THE POLICE TO THE ACTIVITIES OF THE SUSPICIOUS LOOKING PERSONS WHO CAME FROM THE MOUNTAINS. CONSEQUENTLY, THE ARMY SET UP AN AIR LIFT. THE LANDING STRIP WAS LOCATED IN A CLEARING NEAR THE TOWN OF PUEBLO NUEVO. MILITARY VEHICLES WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN WITH SOLDIERS COMING OR GOING TO THE MOUNTAINS. "PAINTED - FACE" SOLDIERS WERE SEEN GOING TO THE MOUNTAINS, WHICH THEY "COMBED" UNTIL THEY REACHED PINALEJO, SANTA BARBARA. "THE SILENCE IN THESE MOUNTAINS WAS SOMETIMES DISRUPTED BY SHOTS AND WE WERE AFRAID. WE HAD NO OTHER CHOICE BUT TO COVER OURSELVES FROM HEAD TO TOE," AN OLD MAN, WHO WAS TOO AFRAID TO REVEAL HIS NAME, STATED. DURING THE DAY, THE PEOPLE MINGLE WITH THE MEN IN UNIFORM, WHO SOMETIMES STOP PEOPLE TO ASK WHERE THEY COME FROM AND CAREFULLY SEARCH VEHICLES -- PARTICULARLY WHEN TRAVELING TO AND FROM THE MILITARIZED COMMUNITIES. COLONEL ERICK O'CONNOR, COMMANDER OF THE 105TH INFANTRY BRIGADE, ARRIVED ON SATURDAY TO INSPECT THE AREA WHERE THE OPERATION HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT. HE REFUSED TO ISSUE A STATEMENT WHEN APPROACHED BY LA TRIBUNA'S REPORTERS, BUT ANNOUNCED THAT THE COMMAND POST WOULD ISSUE AN OFFICIAL REPORT TODAY.
DEV-MUC3-0132	SAN SALVADOR, 16 MAR 89 -- DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL CARLOS EUGENIO VIDES CASANOVA TODAY URGED THE POPULATION TO VOTE IN THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS DESPITE THE RISKS POSED BY THE GUERRILLA BOYCOTT. VIDES CASANOVA SAID THE ARMY IS READY AND HAS IMPLEMENTED MILITARY MEASURES TO COUNTER THE BOYCOTT AGAINST THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS, IN WHICH 1.8 MILLION SALVADORANS WILL ELECT THE SUCCESSOR TO CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE. VIDES CASANOVA ADMITTED THE REBEL BOYCOTT WILL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF VOTERS AND THAT THIS MEASURE WILL AFFECT ALL POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE SAME DEGREE. HE STRESSED THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT WANTS TO DISCREDIT THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND CAPITALIZE ON THE NUMBER OF NULL VOTES AND ABSTENTIONS. VIDES CASANOVA NOTED ELECTIONS WILL TAKE PLACE 19 MARCH IN 240 SALVADORAN MUNICIPALITIES BUT THAT THERE ARE 22 TOWNS, PARTICULARLY IN THE NORTHERN AND EASTERN REGION, WHERE VOTING WILL NOT TAKE PLACE BECAUSE THEY ARE IN VERY DANGEROUS AREAS. VIDES CASANOVA SAID THAT DESPITE GUERRILLA TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, THE ARMY CONTINUES TO RESPECT THE CEASE-FIRE DECLARED ON 28 FEBRUARY TO SUPPORT PRESIDENT DUARTE'S PEACE PROPOSAL.
DEV-MUC3-0133	CLANDESTINE, 17 MAR 89 -- THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT HAS DECIDED TO COMBINE THE PEOPLE'S REJECTION OF THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS WITH AN INTENSIFICATION OF ACTIONS THROUGHOUT THE NATION. THIS INCLUDES THE NATIONWIDE TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE, WHICH WE NOW DECLARE TO BE INDEFINITE. THE REJECTION OF THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS BY OUR PEOPLE AND THE IMPACT OF OUR ACTIONS HAVE LED THE REGIME TO LAUNCH A CAMPAIGN OF DISINFORMATION, AGGRESSION, AND THREATS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN A BID TO CONFUSE THE POPULATION AND, IN ADDITION, TO SET THE STAGE FOR AN ELECTORAL FRAUD. IN ORDER TO MAKE MATTERS CLEAR TO OUR PEOPLE AS WELL AS TO THE LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL PRESS, WE REPORT THE FOLLOWING: 1. THE GAGGING OF THE NATIONAL PRESS IS PART OF THE PLAN TO COVER UP THE FRAUD THAT WILL BE COMMITTED ON 19 MARCH. IN ADDITION, THE CONTROL OVER THE MEDIA IS INTENDED TO ATTRIBUTE TERRORIST ACTIONS TO THE FMLN. 2. THE REGIME HAS TRIED TO BLAME US FOR A NUMBER OF ACTIONS, SUCH AS THE ATTACK ON A RED CROSS AMBULANCE, AMONG OTHERS, FOR THE SAME PURPOSE. THE FMLN HAS A DEFINITE POLICY OF NOT HARMING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. THE HURLING OF GRENADES AT BUS STOPS IS A COMMON PRACTICE OF ARMY PERSONNEL AND IT IS THEREFORE PREPOSTEROUS TO BLAME THE FMLN. 3. A NUMBER OF FALSE COMMUNIQUES WITH AN OBVIOUS TERRORIST TONE HAVE APPEARED. THEY CLUMSILY GLORIFY VIOLENCE AND THREATEN THE PRESS IN TERMS THAT ARE QUITE UNLIKE THOSE APPEARING IN DOCUMENTS IN WHICH WE OUTLINE OUR OFFICIAL POSITION. WE EMPHATICALLY STATE THAT THE FMLN HAS IN NO WAY OR AT ANY TIME THREATENED THE PRESS OR THE CITIZENS. WE RECALL THE FACT THAT OUR OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUES ARE SIGNED BY OUR GENERAL COMMAND AND BROADCAST THROUGH OUR STATIONS. WE REITERATE THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL THING AT THIS TIME IS TO REINFORCE AND EXPAND UNITY IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE THROUGH EVERY POSSIBLE MEANS. THE STRUGGLE WHICH WE ARE WAGING WITH WEAPONS IN HAND IS AIMED AT AN ARMY THAT HAS ONCE MORE DENIED TO OUR NATION THE POSSIBILITY OF FINDING A FORMULA FOR A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION AT AN IMPORTANT CROSSROADS IN THE NATION'S HISTORY. WE MADE A PROPOSAL TO HOLD FREE ELECTIONS, IN PEACE AND FOR PEACE, BUT THE ARMY STUBBORNLY INSISTS ON HOLDING FRAUDULENT ELECTIONS, AT WAR AND FOR WAR. CONSEQUENTLY, THE ELECTIONS WILL BE HELD DURING WAR.
DEV-MUC3-0134	SAN SALVADOR, 18 MAR 89 -- WE ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU A REPORT ON SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED A FEW MINUTES AGO IN THE CENTER OF SAN SALVADOR. WE HAVE ON THE TELEPHONE A LISTENER WHO IS GOING TO TELL US ABOUT TWO EXPLOSIONS JUST BEFORE NOON THAT LEFT AT LEAST FIVE PERSONS WOUNDED. PLEASE GO AHEAD WITH THE REPORT. SONORA LISTENERS, THIS IS A LAST MINUTE REPORT. JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO, AT 1130, TWO BOMBS EXPLODED HERE AT THE EASTERN END OF THE CENTRAL MARKET. FIVE PERSONS WERE SERIOUSLY WOUNDED IN THIS TERRORIST ATTACK. THEY WERE JUST TAKEN TO THE ROSALES HOSPITAL. THE WOUNDED INCLUDE A CHILD AND A WOMAN. WE DID NOT GET THEIR NAMES BECAUSE THE AUTHORITIES DID NOT LET US DO SO. RED CROSS PERSONNEL TOOK THE WOUNDED TO ROSALES HOSPITAL. THE PEOPLE AROUND HERE ARE VERY FRIGHTENED AND ARE RUNNING AROUND. THE PEOPLE WERE BUYING FOOD WHEN THE EXPLOSIONS OCCURRED. THEY ARE NERVOUS AND ARE TRYING TO QUICKLY FIND TRANSPORTATION. THE EXPLOSIONS WERE HEARD FAR FROM HERE. AT THE MARKET'S EASTERN GATE, WHERE THE FRUIT STANDS ARE LOCATED, WE WERE TOLD BY PASSERSBY THAT A MAN WORKING THERE WAS THE MOST SERIOUSLY WOUNDED BY THE BOMBS. ALL THE WOUNDED WERE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL. THE TERRORISTS LEFT A COMMUNIQUE THAT WAS IMMEDIATELY PICKED UP BY THE NATIONAL POLICE. THE PEOPLE ARE FLEEING THE MARKET. THEY CANNOT CONTINUE SHOPPING BECAUSE IT IS ASSUMED THIS WAS A WARNING TO KEEP THE PEOPLE FROM GOING OUT OR GOING TO VOTE.
DEV-MUC3-0135	SAN SALVADOR, 18 MAR 89 -- ON THE EVE OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, MORE THAN 80 PERCENT OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IN SAN SALVADOR IS PARALYZED WHILE A MAJORITY OF THE RESIDENTS ARE NOT RECEIVING POTABLE WATER OR ELECTRIC POWER. REPORTS ARRIVING THIS MORNING FROM THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CAPITAL, STATE THAT CITIES SUCH AS MEJICANOS, SAN MARCOS, APOPA, ISUSTEPEQUE, AND DELGADO, AMONG OTHERS, HAVE NOT RECEIVED BASIC PUBLIC SERVICES FOR THE PAST 3 DAYS. THE NATIONAL POLICE THIS MORNING REPORTED THAT PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IN SAN SALVADOR HAS BEEN MORE THAN 80 PERCENT HALTED FOR THE 3D DAY IN A ROW AND ONLY CERTAIN MINIBUSES AND LIGHT CARGO VEHICLES ARE SERVING CERTAIN ROUTES. WORKERS AT THE EASTERN AND WESTERN BUS TERMINALS OF THIS CAPITAL REPORT THAT THE TRANSPORTATION SITUATION IS SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY'S. NO BUSES HAVE ARRIVED OR DEPARTED SAN SALVADOR FOR THE COUNTRY'S 13 DEPARTMENTS. MUCH CENTRAL AMERICAN COMMERCIAL TRANSPORTATION IS ALSO PARALYZED BY THE TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE IN EL SALVADOR SINCE MANY RAILROAD BOXCARS ARE BEING HELD UP AT THE SALVADORAN BORDERS UNABLE TO ENTER THE NATIONAL TERRITORY. MEANWHILE, AT LEAST TWO BOMBS PLACED NEAR ELECTRIC POWER POLES WERE DETONATED THIS MORNING IN SAN SALVADOR. ONE WAS PLACED AT 16 WEST STREET IN THE IVU NEIGHBORHOOD, IN THE SOUTHERN AREA OF THE CAPITAL, AND A FRAGMENTATION GRENADE EXPLODED NEAR THE SANTA ISABEL NEIGHBORHOOD.

IN THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL, POLICE-MILITARY SECURITY HAS BEEN STEPPED UP LESS THAN 24 BEFORE THE 1989 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. WE HAVE NOTICED A LARGER NUMBER OF SECURITY PERSONNEL NEAR THE SEVEN VOTING CENTERS THE CENTRAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL HAS SET UP IN SAN SALVADOR MUNICIPALITY. IN THE OUTLYING CITIES OF NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, SUCH AS MEXICANOS, CUSCATANCINGO, AND APOPA, TRANSPORTATION IS STILL COMPLETELY PARALYZED IN THE WAKE OF THE GROUND TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE DECREED BY THE FMLN, WHICH IS IN ITS 3D DAY TODAY. MEANWHILE, REPORTS FROM CHALATENANGO, 72 KM NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR, STATE THAT THE ENTIRE DEPARTMENT IS WITHOUT ELECTRICITY DUE TO RATIONING THAT THE CEL HAS IMPOSED ON THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AFTER FMLN GUERRILLAS CARRIED OUT LARGE-SCALE SABOTAGE OPERATIONS AGAINST THE ELECTRICITY NETWORK EARLY THIS WEEK. MILITARY SOURCES CONSULTED THIS MORNING IN CHALATENANGO SAID THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO CLASHES BETWEEN MILITARY FORCES AND GUERRILLAS IN THAT AREA FOR THE PAST FEW HOURS.

DEV-MUC3-0142	SAN SALVADOR, 19 MAR 89 -- AFTER A 1ST HOUR IN WHICH THERE WAS A VERY SMALL TURNOUT AT THE POLLS, THE NUMBER OF SALVADORANS GOING TO VOTE IN THE CAPITAL CITY AND OTHER TOWNS IS INCREASING. THOUSANDS OF VOTERS WERE STANDING IN LINES AT MID-MORNING. ARMY AND POLICE UNITS SURROUND THE POLLS WHILE MILITARY HELICOPTERS CONTINUE TO FLY OVER THE CITY. FIDEL CHAVEZ MENA OF THE RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY TOLD THE PRESS HE HAS RECEIVED REPORTS FROM HIS FOLLOWERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY TO THE EFFECT THAT 95 PERCENT OF THE POLLS HAVE BEEN INSTALLED AND ARE OPERATING, AFTER OVERCOMING SOME EARLY MORNING PROBLEMS IN SOME OF THE PLACES.

HIGHWAY CHECKPOINT SOLDIERS KILLED TWO SALVADORAN REPORTERS, ROBERTO NAVAS AND MAURICIO PINEDA, IN TWO SEPARATE SHOOTINGS LATE LAST NIGHT AND EARLY THIS MORNING.

HOWEVER, HE ADMITTED THAT IN EIGHT MUNICIPALITIES, THE POLLING STATIONS HAD BEEN UNABLE TO OPEN, WHICH BRINGS TO 29 OUT OF 262 THE NUMBER OF MUNICIPALITIES WHERE ELECTIONS HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED. VIDES STATED THAT HALFWAY THROUGH ELECTION DAY, ONE-THIRD OF THE OVER 1.8 MILLION VOTERS HAD CAST THEIR VOTES FOR A NEW SALVADORAN PRESIDENT.
DEV-MUC3-0146	SANTIAGO, 19 MAR 89 -- GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET HAS SIGNIFICANTLY CURBED HIS CRITICISMS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES, BUT HAS STEPPED UP HIS ATTACKS ON THE CHILEAN OPPOSITION, IN CONNECTION WITH THE TEMPORARY EMBARGO THAT THE UNITED STATES LEVIED ON CHILEAN FRUIT EXPORTS. "THE DUTY OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF THE POPULATION OF THEIR COUNTRY," PINOCHET SAID, IN MARKED CONTRAST TO HIS STATEMENTS A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO. THE CHILEAN CHIEF EXECUTIVE CALLED THE EMBARGO THAT THE UNITED STATES LEVIED ON CHILEAN GRAPES AFTER CYANIDE WAS FOUND IN SUCH GRAPES IN PHILADELPHIA "A SERIOUS MEASURE." THE EMBARGO WAS PARTIALLY LIFTED YESTERDAY. PINOCHET SAID THAT THE ANTI-U.S. REACTIONS IN CHILE WERE "UNFAIR" AND REAFFIRMED THAT "THE DUTY OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS TO PROTECT THE POPULATION OF THEIR COUNTRY." THE CHILEAN PRESIDENT ALSO HARSHLY CRITICIZED THE OPPOSITION, ESPECIALLY THOSE "WHO ARE UNDERHANDEDLY ACTING AGAINST OUR COUNTRY," CALLING THEM "TURNCOATS." PINOCHET ASKED: "HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE GONE TO THE UNITED STATES TO BEG, TO WHINE, AND TO SPREAD TALES IN ORDER TO STOP LOANS TO US? HAS EVERYONE FORGOTTEN THAT THERE IS A GENTLEMAN WHO HAS BEEN ASKING THE UNITED STATES NOT TO GIVE US ANY MORE LOANS?" THE CHILEAN PRESIDENT ADMITTED THAT "THE UNITED STATES HAD BEEN ATTACKED" BECAUSE "THEIR INITIAL MEASURE WAS HASTY. IT AMOUNTED TO USING A TANK TO KILL A FLEA. IT WAS A HARSH MEASURE WHICH HAD THE IMMEDIATE RESULT OF STOPPING OUR SHIPMENTS OF FRUIT ABROAD." PINOCHET EMPHASIZED, HOWEVER, THAT THE UNITED STATES WAS NOT TO BLAME, BUT RATHER "THOSE WHO HAVE REQUESTED A BOYCOTT AGAINST ."
DEV-MUC3-0147	EL PARAISO , 19 MAR 89 -- COLONEL ALEXANDER MENDEZ, COMMANDER OF THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE, THE MAIN GARRISON IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY, HAS TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT OVER 500 GUERRILLA FIGHTERS ATTACKED TWO TOWNS IN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT HOURS BEFORE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS STARTED. ACCORDING TO THE OFFICER, THE CLASHES, WHICH BEGAN AT 2200 LAST NIGHT AND ENDED AT 0500 TODAY, RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF SEVEN REBELS AND ONE SOLDIER NEAR THE TOWNS OF TEJUTLA AND SAN MIGUEL DE MERCEDES. ALEXANDER MENDEZ SAID AT THE EL PARAISO GARRISON THAT THE HIGH NUMBER OF GUERRILLA FIGHTERS INCLUDED "ATTACKERS AND OTHERS WHO PROVIDE COOPERATION AND CARE FOR THE WOUNDED." THE OFFICER REPORTED 17 CASUALTIES, INCLUDING 9 WOUNDED SOLDIERS. A PEASANT WOMAN DIED WHEN A BOMB EXPLODED IN HER KITCHEN DURING THE ATTACK ON SAN MIGUEL DE MERCEDES. THE EXPLOSION ALSO BLEW OFF HER SONS' LEGS, THE MILITARY COMMANDER SAID. MENDEZ STATED THAT FIVE HOUSES WERE DESTROYED DURING THE ATTACK ON SAN MIGUEL DE MERCEDES, 7 KM FROM THE CAPITAL OF CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT. THE SALVADORAN OFFICER CONFIRMED THAT THREE U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS HAD TRAVELED TO CHALATENANGO TO HELP COUNTER THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE. ACAN-EFE WAS ABLE TO ASCERTAIN THAT ONE OF THE OFFICERS INCLUDED A U.S. AIR FORCE COLONEL, WHO WAS WEARING FATIGUES AND CARRYING AN AR-15 RIFLE ON HIS SHOULDER. MENDEZ ASSERTED THAT THERE ARE USUALLY FOUR U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS AT THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE, AND ADDED THAT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO CARRY WEAPONS LIKE THE AR-15 "WHENEVER THE CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE IT," ALTHOUGH THEY MAY NOT PARTICIPATE IN OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS. THE CLASHES CAUSED PANIC AMONG PEOPLE IN CHALATENANGO WHO COULD HEAR THE HEAVY FIRING BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND THE SALVADORAN ARMY SHORTLY AFTER THE VOTING TABLES OPENED. ACCORDING TO THE SALVADORAN OFFICER, LAST NIGHT'S GUERRILLA ATTACK IS "ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IN THE LATEST OFFENSIVE" LAUNCHED BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT IN SEPTEMBER. MENDEZ SAID THAT THE GUERRILLA ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT WITH NUMEROUS WEAPONS. HE EMPHASIZED THE USE OF THE NEW AK-M RIFLES, "A NEW VERSION OF THE FAMOUS GDR-MADE AK-47."
DEV-MUC3-0148	SAN SALVADOR, 19 MAR 89 -- HERE IN EL SALVADOR IF THEY WANTED TO ESTABLISH A MECHANISM TO SLOWLY ESTABLISH PEACE IN THE ENTIRE REGION. THOSE ARE THE EFFORTS . WHAT CAN THE GOVERNMENT DO ABOUT THE FMLN ? WE CAN ASK THEM TO JOIN THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC, CIVIC LIFE TO PEOPLE TO LIVE IN PEACE. HOW DO YOU VIEW THE VOTING SITUATION AND THE SECURITY AND SURVEILLANCE THE ARMED FORCES IS PROVIDING, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE BEING CHARGED WITH THE DEATH OF TWO JOURNALISTS? I THINK YOU ARE AWARE OF THAT. TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. WE ARE THE FIRST ONES TO REGRET THE DEATH OF THE CANAL DOCE NEWSMEN WHO DIED IN SAN MIGUEL AND THE REUTER CORRESPONDENT WHO DIED HERE ON ARMY BOULEVARD. THOSE DEATHS ARE THE RESULT OF THE PREVAILING UNREST AND NERVOUSNESS. THERE ARE BULLETS BEING FIRED ALL OVER THE PLACE AND, UNFORTUNATELY, THOSE REPORTERS WERE THE FIRST TO GET HIT. THIS CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAS . DID THE ARMY SUFFER CASUALTIES DURING THE INCIDENTS IN SAN RAMON? I CAN TELL YOU THAT A BRACAMONTE BATTALION CORPORAL DIED AND ANOTHER SOLDIER WAS WOUNDED. HOWEVER, THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE AND BRACAMONTE BATTALION SOLDIERS REACTED QUICKLY AND REPELLED THE TERRORIST ACTIVITY THAT IS CURRENTLY CAUSING CHAOS IN SAN SALVADOR. HAVE OTHER INCIDENTS BEEN REPORTED? IT IS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE WHAT THE FMLN IS SAYING. THEIR SPOKESMAN IN MEXICO CITY SAID THEY WOULD NOT ATTACK THE VOTING TABLES. HOWEVER, WE HAVE HEARD THAT VOTING TABLES HAVE BEEN ATTACKED IN 15 AREAS OF THE COUNTRY. ATTACKS ON VOTING TABLES WERE REPORTED IN CHALATENANGO, SAN ANTONIO, CIUDAD BARRIOS, CAROLINA, AND NORTH . IN USULUTAN, THE FMLN PLANTED TWO BOMBS JUST OUTSIDE THE CITY TO FRIGHTEN THE PEOPLE. HOWEVER, OUR PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC NATURE IS TELLING THE FMLN: WE DO NOT WANT TERRORISM, WE WANT PEACE, AND WE ARE USING PEACEFUL MEANS TO ACHIEVE POWER AND CHOOSE OUR PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT. HOW IS THE VOTING PROCESS PROGRESSING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY? THERE ARE 27 MUNICIPALITIES WHERE ELECTIONS ARE NOT BEING HELD. WE KNOW FOR SURE THAT THERE ARE MUNICIPALITIES, LIKE CINQUERA AND ARAMBALA, WHERE , AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT . WE KNOW THERE ARE 27 MUNICIPALITIES WHERE THERE WILL BE NO VOTING AND THERE ARE OTHERS THAT THAT THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND MEMBERS OF THE MUNICIPAL VOTING TABLE BOARDS . HOW MANY SOLDIERS ARE PROTECTING THE VOTING TABLE BOARDS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY? ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF OUR SOLDIERS ARE PART OF THE DEMOCRACY PLAN. WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE OFFERING THE SAME PROTECTION AFTER THE VOTING CENTERS ARE CLOSED . WE HAVE READ SOME REPORTS THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE URGING THE PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY . WILL THE SOLDIERS BE ALLOWED TO VOTE? FIRST, I EMPHATICALLY AND CATEGORICALLY DENY THAT WE ARE URGING THE PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR THE PDC. WE HAVE SENT A MEMORANDUM TO ALL THE COMMANDERS AND CHIEFS ADVISING THEM THAT WE MUST HAVE A COMPLETELY APOLITICAL ATTITUDE AND REFRAIN FROM PARTICIPATING IN ANY POLITICAL ACTIVITY. WE MUST PROTECT ALL POLITICAL PARTIES, WE MUST PROTECT ALL THE VOTING CENTERS, AND WE MUST ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE AREAS SURROUNDING THE VOTING CENTERS. WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN WHO WINS THE ELECTIONS; WE ARE INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IS RESPECTED AND . THIS IS A DAY FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO PROVE THEIR DEMOCRATIC NATURE. WILL SOLDIERS BE ALLOWED TO CAST THEIR VOTES TODAY? AS SOLDIERS WE ALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE. BUT BEFORE WE CAST OUR VOTE WE ARE GOING TO FULFILL OUR DUTY. OUR DUTY IS TO GUARANTEE SAFETY. THIS WILL NOT CREATE A PROBLEM. FOR EXAMPLE, IF A SOLDIER'S IDENTIFICATION CARD WAS ISSUED IN SAN SALVADOR BUT HE IS STATIONED IN AGUILARES, HE WILL BE ALLOWED TO VOTE AT A SPECIFIC VOTING CENTER. THOSE WHO CAN VOTE WILL DO SO AS CIVILIANS AND THEY WILL BE UNARMED. MOSTLY ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL AND . THE REBELS HAVE THREATENED TO LAUNCH A LARGE ATTACK. DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH MEN TO FIGHT THEM AT THIS TIME? SINCE 1982, WE HAVE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THE COUNTRY. THE PEOPLE BEFORE AND AFTER THE ELECTIONS. AMID SABOTAGE TO THE POWER SYSTEM. WE ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING A WATER PROBLEM . WE ARE GOING TO EXERCISE OUR RIGHT AS ESTABLISHED IN THE CONSTITUTION AND WE ARE GOING PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE PEOPLE, OUR SOVEREIGNTY, AND .
DEV-MUC3-0149	HAVANA , 20 MAR 89 -- JOSE RICARDO PERDOMO, CHAIRMAN OF THE CENTRAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL OF EL SALVADOR, ANNOUNCED THE END OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN THE COUNTRY IN A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW WITH TASS. THE COUNTING OF VOTES IN SUNDAY'S ELECTION IN THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN OBSERVERS WAS IN PROGRESS, AND PRELIMINARY RESULTS WOULD BE DECLARED LATER ON MONDAY. POLITICAL OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, CANDIDATE OF THE RIGHT-WING NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE, HAS WON. STAFF MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL NOTED IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THAT VOTING BEGAN SLOWLY IN THE MORNING. A TOTAL OF 1,835,000 VOTERS WERE REGISTERED IN THE COUNTRY WITH A POPULATION OF FIVE MILLION. ACCORDING TO ESTIMATES OF JOURNALISTS IN SAN SALVADOR, THE PERCENTAGE OF SALVADOREANS WHO ABSTAINED FROM VOTING WAS HIGHER THIS TIME THAN AT THE 1984 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WHICH WAS WON BY JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, CANDIDATE OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY. CONSTANT ARMED CLASHES BETWEEN DETACHMENTS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT AND ARMY UNITS INTERFERED WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. ON THE EVE OF THE ELECTION, THE INSURGENT RADIO STATIONS MARTI BROADCAST REPORTS THAT GUERILLAS WOULD NOT ATTACK POLLING STATIONS. INSURGENTS ATTACKED MILITARY GARRISONS IN MORER THAN 20 INHABITED LOCALITIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY ON SUNDAY, PUTTING OUT OF ACTION SOME 150 GOVERNMENT TROOPS. GUERILLAS ALSO DOWNED A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP IN USULUTAN REGION. AS A RESULT OF INSURGENT ACTIONS, A CONSIDERABLE PART OF THE COUNTRY REMAINS WITHOUT ELECTRICITY OR TELEPHONE COMMUNICATION. THE INSURGENT OPERATION TO BLOCK HIGHWAYS AND RAILWAYS CONTINUES. CASANOVA, SALVADOREAN MINISTER OF DEFENCE AND PUBLIC SECURITY, ADMITTED THAT THE ELECTION DID NOT TAKE PLACE IN 29 OUT OF 262 DISTRICTS IN THE COUNTRY DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE ARMY COULD NOT RESTORE CONTROL OVER THOSE TERRITORIES. APART FROM MOTOR VEHICLES WITH TROOPS AND MILITARY PARTOLS, ONLY TAXIS WITH JOURNALISTS COVERING THE VOTING DROVE IN SAN SALVADOR ON THE ELECTION DAY. PRESS CARS HAD WHITE HANDKERCHIEFS FIXED TO AERIALS. THIS PRECAUTION WAS TAKEN AFTER MILITARY PATROLS KILLED THREE JOURNALISTS: ROBNERTO NAVAS, A REUTER NEWS PHOTOGRAPHER, CORONEL LAGROW, A DUTCH TV CORRESPONDENT, AND MAURICIO PINEDA, A STAFF MEMBER OF SALVADOREAN TELEVISION. LUIS GALDAMEZ, ANOTHER REUTER CORRESPONDENT, WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED, AND HIS ARM WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO BE AMPUTATED.
DEV-MUC3-0150	LA PAZ, 21 MAR 89 -- A BOMB PLANTED NEAR THE U.S. EMBASSY IN THIS CAPITAL WAS DEFUSED TODAY BY THE POLICE. ACCORDING TO EARLY REPORTS FROM THE BOMB SQUAD, WHICH IS SUBORDINATE TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, AN ANONYMOUS CALL RECEIVED AT THE U.S. EMBASSY REPORTED THAT THE BOMB WAS ABOUT TO EXPLODE. THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN LA PAZ IS 3 BLOCKS FROM THE PLAZA DE ARMAS AND 3 BLOCKS FROM THE GOVERNMENT PALACE, AND THE LEGISLATIVE PALACE. A TEAM FROM THE BOLIVIAN BOMB SQUAD MANAGED TO LOCATE AND DEFUSE THE BOMB AT 1810 . NO PERSON OR TERRORIST ORGANIZATION HAS YET CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR PLANTING THE BOMB.
DEV-MUC3-0151	CLANDESTINE, 21 MAR 89 -- THE DAY OF FIGHTING THAT RESULTED IN ENORMOUS ABSTENTION DURING THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS REPRESENTED AN OVERWHELMING VICTORY FOR THE PEOPLE. THIS WAS A FIGHTER'S WAY OF REPUDIATING THE WAR ELECTIONS THAT WERE HELD AFTER THE FMLN PEACE PROPOSAL WAS BLOCKED. IT ALSO REPRESENTED A DEFEAT FOR THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION, WHICH WAS BENT ON CARRYING OUT A DEADLY WAR AGAINST OUR PEOPLE DISGUISED AS A HYPOCRITICAL CENTRIST AND FALSELY DEMOCRATIC CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT. WE STRUGGLE FOR A JUST AND NEGOTIATED PEACE WITH GENUINE DEMOCRACY, SOCIAL JUSTICE, AND NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, AND WE GAVE A WORLD-RESOUNDING BLOW TO THE ENEMIES OF PEACE. THE THOUSANDS OF FMLN FIGHTERS WHO FOUGHT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, CITIES AND INTERIOR, ENCOURAGED BY AN UNPRECEDENTED INTENSITY AND SIMULTANEITY; THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF UNION MEMBERS, PEASANTS, STUDENTS, TEACHERS, DISPLACED PERSONS, UNEMPLOYED PERSONS, GOVERNMENT AND MUNICIPAL WORKERS, MOTHERS AND FAMILY MEMBERS OF POLITICAL PRISONERS AND MISSING PERSONS, MEMBERS OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, BELIEVERS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL THE CHURCHES WHO TOOK TO THE STREET TO DEMAND THAT THE FMLN PEACE PROPOSAL BE ACCEPTED AND WHO LATER REPUDIATED THE 19 MARCH WARMONGERING ELECTIONS; THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CITIZENS, MORE THAN 1 MILLION PERSONS WITH VALID VOTING CARDS, WHO REFUSED TO VOTE, AND THE MORE THAN 200,000 WHO CAST A VOID OR BLANK BALLOT--SOMETHING THE CENTRAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL, THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE , AND THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY ARE TRYING TO HIDE; THE TENS OF THOUSANDS WHO VOTED FOR THE DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE; AND THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS WHO WERE NOT INTERESTED IN GETTING THEIR VOTING CARD THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE DISCREDITED ELECTIONS ARE THE IMMENSE MAJORITY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WHO SAID NO TO THE COUNTERINSURGENCY WAR AND YES TO A JUST POLITICAL AND NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE NATIONAL CONFLICT. YES TO A REAL DEMOCRACY; NO TO THE TRADITIONAL LIE OF A VOTE THAT ONLY SERVES TO JUSTIFY AND FACILITATE U.S. MILITARY AID, WHICH PROMOTES THE CONTINUATION OF THE WAR AND WORSENS THE SERIOUS PROBLEMS OF POVERTY, MISERY, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND REPRESSION BEING EXPERIENCED BY OUR PEOPLE. THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS WERE HELD, BUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS WHO LIVE ABROAD WERE KEPT FROM VOTING. MANY OF THESE PEOPLE FLED THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING PERSECUTED OR BECAUSE THE ARMED FORCES FORCED THEM TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES THROUGH THEIR BOMBINGS AND OTHER ATROCITIES. THEY ARE ACTIVE SALVADORANS. THANKS TO THEIR WORK, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER SALVADORANS, MEMBERS OF THEIR FAMILIES WHO HAVE REMAINED IN EL SALVADOR, CAN SURVIVE. HOWEVER, THESE PEOPLE WERE DENIED THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE, A RIGHT THE FMLN PROPOSAL TO TURN THE ELECTIONS INTO A MECHANISM FOR PEACE WOULD HAVE GRANTED THEM. MR ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS DECLARED HIMSELF THE WINNER IN AN ELECTION THAT SAW THE LARGEST ABSTENTION IN THESE YEARS OF WAR. MORE THAN 60 PERCENT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE DID NOT VOTE OR CAST VOID AND BLANK VOTES. THE VOTES CRISTIANI GOT DO NOT TOTAL 20 PERCENT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. MANY OF THOSE WHO VOTED FOR CRISTIANI WERE DECEIVED BY ARENA'S PROPAGANDA THAT PROMISED EMPLOYMENT, HOUSING, EDUCATION, SCHOOLS, PUBLIC HEALTH, ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND PROSPERITY, ETC. CRISTIANI AND ARENA KNOW THEY ARE GETTING A COUNTRY DROWNING IN AN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CRISIS, WITH A GROWING REVOLUTIONARY WAR, AND THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP THOSE PROMISES. NO ONE CAN DO ANYTHING WITHOUT FIRST ACHIEVING A JUST PEACE. FOR ALL THESE REASONS, ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S ELECTION CANNOT BE CONSIDERED EITHER MORALLY OR POLITICALLY LEGITIMATE.
DEV-MUC3-0152	MANAGUA , 21 MAR 89 -- FAR FROM ACHIEVING A TRUCE THE DAY THE RECENT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS WERE HELD, A GENERAL INCREASE IN VIOLENCE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WAS THE RESULT OF THE CIVIL WAR IN WHICH THE UNITED STATES AND THE MILITARY HAVE SUBMERGED EL SALVADOR FOR THE PAST 9 YEARS. ON THE ONE HAND THERE WAS THE MILITARIZATION OF THE ELECTIONS THEMSELVES AND THE INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING AND MACHINEGUNNING OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION, WHICH LEFT A TOLL OF HUNDREDS OF VICTIMS AS WELL AS THREE NEWSMEN MURDERED BY ARMY MEMBERS. ON THE OTHER HAND THERE WERE MILITARY ACTIONS BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT , WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INFLICTED 150 CASUALTIES ON THE ARMY AND BROUGHT 90 PERCENT OF TRAFFIC TO A STANDSTILL. THE VOTING STATISTICS PAINT A SIMILAR PICTURE: IN 29 OF THE 262 MUNICIPALITIES IN WHICH THE COUNTRY IS DIVIDED, THERE WAS NO VOTING AT ALL. OF THE 2.2 MILLION SALVADORANS WHO SHOULD BE ON THE VOTING LISTS, ONLY 1.8 MILLION WERE REGISTERED, AND WHILE 60 PERCENT OF THE VOTERS SHOWED UP AT THE POLLS FOR THE 1984 ELECTIONS, THIS FIGURE WAS COMPLETELY INVERTED THIS PAST 19 MARCH. TODAY -- JUST LIKE BEFORE THE BALLOTING BEGAN -- PEACE, DEMOCRACY, AND SOCIAL HARMONY IN EL SALVADOR AS LONG AS THE UNITED STATES AND THE ARMY CONTINUE TO USURP THE POWER FORMALLY REPRESENTED BY A CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT, AND ANY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS -- IN ADDITION TO YIELDING ANOTHER FARCE SIMILAR TO THE ONE THAT HAS JUST BEEN STAGED -- WILL ONLY RESULT IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF VIOLENCE THAT MIGHT EXTEND EVEN FURTHER AND REACH EVEN BLOODIER PROPORTIONS. IF, ON THE CONTRARY, THOSE WHO REALLY HOLD POWER WERE INTERESTED IN A NEGOTIATED, PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT, THEY WOULD AT LEAST BE TAKING THE FIRST SERIOUS STEPS TO MEET WITH THE OTHER BELLIGERENT FORCE: THE FMLN. FOR THE TIME BEING, HOWEVER, THE NEW ELECTORAL FARCE HAS ACCOMPLISHED NOTHING BUT TO PROVIDE OVERWHELMING PROOF THAT IT IS ENTIRELY UNVIABLE AND INEFFECTIVE.
DEV-MUC3-0153	EAST BERLIN , 22 MAR 89 -- HIS NAME STANDS AT THE TOP OF THE HIT LIST OF THE COLOMBIAN DEATH SQUAD: OSCAR DUENAS, MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION AND CITY COUNSELOR OF TUNJA, NORTH OF THE CAPITAL OF BOGOTA. IN A TALK DURING HIS VISIT TO BERLIN THIS WEEK, HE EMPHASIZED THE DRAMATIC SITUATION IN HIS HOME COUNTRY. IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY AN UNPRECEDENTED ANNIHILATION CAMPAIGN, WHICH IS AIMED MAINLY AT FUNCTIONARIES AND OFFICIALS OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION -- A MOVEMENT THAT INCLUDES COMMUNIST, LEFT-WING, AND OTHER DEMOCRATIC FORCES. MORE THAN 800 UP POLITICIANS HAVE ALREADY HAD TO PAY FOR THEIR SUPPORT FOR A DEMOCRATIC COLOMBIA WITH THEIR LIVES, OSCAR DUENAS NOTED. THE COLOMBIAN PATRIOT SAID THAT THE ALL-POWERFUL NARCOTICS MAFIA, IN ALLIANCE WITH THE LARGE LANDOWNERS, RIGHT-WING MILITARY, AND PARTS OF THE OLIGARCHY ARE BEHIND ALL THESE ATTACKS. THEY FEAR FOR THEIR POWER AND ARE PREPARED TO USE ANY MEANS TO PRESERVE IT. FROM HIS OWN EXPERIENCE, OSCAR DUENAS REPORTED HOW THE DEATH SQUAD PERSECUTES ITS OPPONENTS. A GROUP WHICH CALLS ITSELF "RAMBO" HAS WAYLAID HIM SEVERAL TIMES. HOWEVER, UP TO NOW HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN WARNED IN TIME. THERE IS ALWAYS THE DANGER OF HIS BEING SHOT AT FROM A WINDOW, A PASSING CAR, OR FROM BEHIND A BUSH. THIS IS WHY THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES HIM -- AND OTHER UP POLITICIANS -- WITH BODYGUARDS AROUND THE CLOCK. "EVEN THOUGH THIS MEANS A PERMANENT THREAT, WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT!" OSCAR DUENAS AFFIRMED. ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES OF A POLITICAL SOLUTION, THE CITY COUNSELOR OF TUNJA SEES AN OPPORTUNITY IF THE GOVERNMENT COOPERATES WITH ALL DEMOCRATS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST GANG TERRORISM AND DOES NOT TRY TO SPLIT UP THE MOVEMENT OF THE LEFT.
DEV-MUC3-0154	GUATEMALA, 27 MAR 89 -- TWO NEW SHOOTOUTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN THE PAST FEW MINUTES AT THE PAVON PRISON FARM, WHERE INMATES MUTINIED SUNDAY AFTER RAIDING THE ARMORY.

WHETHER THE LAST TWO SHOOTOUTS HAVE RESULTED IN CASUALTIES HAS NOT BEEN DISCLOSED.

THE SPECIAL DELEGATION IS COMPOSED OF MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION COMMISSION, HEADED BY NICARAGUAN CARDINAL MIGUEL OBANDO Y BRAVO, AND OPPOSITION DEPUTIES.

COLONEL EFRAIN GONZALEZ, HONDURAN AMBASSADOR TO NICARAGUA, TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT HIS GOVERNMENT DOES NOT MIND THE DELEGATION'S VISIT TO HONDURAS TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE KIDNAPPED PERSONS. THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE DENIES THAT IT IS HOLDING MORE THAN 1,000 CIVILIANS, AS THE SANDINISTS ALLEGE, BUT ADMITS IT IS HOLDING NICARAGUAN SOLDIERS.
DEV-MUC3-0156	LIMA, 27 MAR 89 -- A LOCAL RADIO STATION HAS REPORTED THAT ALLEGED SHINING PATH MEMBERS AND MERCENARIES AT THE SERVICE OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS TODAY ATTACKED AN IMPORTANT POLICE STATION IN THE JUNGLE DISTRICT OF UCHIZA, AND THAT THERE MAY BE MANY CASUALTIES ON BOTH SIDES. THE RADIO STATION RADIO PROGRAMAS DEL PERU BASES THEIR INFORMATION ON A REPORT FROM A SPOKESMAN OF ANOTHER POLICE STATION OF THE NATIONAL POLICE LOCATED IN TOCACHE, 145 KM SOUTH OF UCHIZA.

A PERUVIAN TELEPHONE COMPANY SOURCE SAID THAT THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN LIMA AND UCHIZA, BOTH TELEPHONE AND RADIO, "ARE INTERRUPTED" BUT THE REASONS FOR THIS WAS NOT GIVEN. UCHIZA IS LOCATED IN THE SAN MARTIN DEPARTMENT, IN THE ALTO HUALLAGA REGION, WHICH HAS BEEN DOMINATED BY SHINING PATH FOR THE LAST 2 YEARS AND HAS ALLIED ITSELF WITH POWERFUL DRUG TRAFFICKERS ACCORDING TO PRIME MINISTER ARMANDO VILLANUEVA DEL CAMPO. BOTH UCHIZA AND TOCACHE ARE CONSIDERED POTENTIAL ZONES FOR GROWING COCA AND FOR MAKING COCAINE BASE. THEY HAVE BEEN UNDER A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND MILITARY CONTROL SINCE 1987. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL POLICE, PERU IS THE LARGEST PRODUCER OF COCA AND THE BIGGEST POTENTIAL SELLER OF COCAINE BASE TO INTERNATIONAL DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

THAT IS THE REPORT WE ARE RECEIVING FROM JUCUAPA, WHERE THE HELICOPTER WAS FORCED TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY LANDING. THE REPORT ADDS THAT A FEW MINUTES AFTER THE AMBUSH, A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP ARRIVED IN THE AREA LAUNCHING ROCKETS AND INDISCRIMINATELY FIRING AT THE LA NORIA AND LA PENA CANTONS' CIVILIAN POPULATION. WE SEND OUR REVOLUTIONARY GREETINGS TO SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT, BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE OUR COMRADES' GOOD MARKSMANSHIP.
DEV-MUC3-0162	TEGUCIGALPA, 31 MAR 89 -- THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES INTELLIGENCE CORPS YESTERDAY THWARTED "OPERATION SUMMER 89," WHICH WAS A SANDINIST PEOPLE'S ARMY PLAN TO SABOTAGE AND PILLAGE TOWNS ON THE HONDURAS-NICARAGUA BORDER. A MILITARY SOURCE MADE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, ADDING THAT 15 DAYS AGO, AN EPS BATTALION STATIONED IN SOMOTO WAS DEPLOYED TO THE EASTERN PART OF HONDURAS, AND ENROUTE THEY WERE JOINED BY 300 MEN WHO WERE INSTRUCTED TO WEAR U.S. ARMY AND CONTRA UNIFORMS. ACCORDING TO THE SOURCE, OF THE 300 MEN, 50 ENTERED HONDURAN TOWNS, AMONG THEM ALAUCA, SAMAYARES, OROPOLI, AND SANTA MARIA, WHERE THEY CARRIED OUT SABOTAGE AND PILLAGE IN THE HOPE THAT RESIDENTS WOULD BLAME THE CONTRAS AND RETALIATE AGAINST THEM. MOREOVER, HE ADDED, FIVE MEN HAD THE AUDACITY TO ENTER THE 6TH INFANTRY BATALLION'S POSITIONS IN OJO DE AGUA TO MAKE A SKETCH OF THE 110TH INFANTRY BRIGADE BATALLION'S EXACT LOCATION AND ESTABLISH THE ACTUAL LOCATION OF HONDURAN TROOPS IN THAT SECTOR. THE SOURCE SAID THE SANDINISTS WHO ENTERED HONDURAN TERRITORY USED BOOBY TRAPS TO CARRY OUT THEIR ACTIONS, AND WERE EQUIPPED WITH ASSAULT WEAPONS, RPG'S, AND AK-47 MACHINEGUNS. TO CONCLUDE, THE SOURCE SAID "OPERATION SUMMER 89" WAS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN YESTERDAY, 30 MARCH, BUT THE ARMED FORCES ARE CONSTANTLY ON ALERT TO AVOID ANY WRONGFUL ACTIONS AND TO GUARANTEE NATIONAL INTEGRITY AND SOVEREIGNTY.
DEV-MUC3-0163	SOFIA , 31 MAR 89 -- MR MANUEL CEPEDA , MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE CC OF THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY AND EDITOR IN CHIEF OF THE VOZ NEWSPAPER, VISITED THIS COUNTRY FROM MARCH 28 TO MARCH 31. HE HAD A MEETING WITH MR DIMITUR STANISHEV, SECRETARY OF THE CC OF THE BCP , WHO ACQUAINTED THE GUEST WITH THE LATEST MOMENTS OF THE ACTIVITY OF THE BCP IN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TASKS RELATED TO THE INNOVATIVE PROCESSES IN THE DIFFERENT SPHERES OF THE SOCIOPOLITICAL LIFE IN BULGARIA. OPINIONS WERE EXCHANGED ON THE CONDITION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNIST MOVEMENT, ON THE NEED OF CREATIVE RECONSIDERATION OF THE INTERNAL AND INTERNATIONAL REALITIES IN THE SPIRIT OF THE AIMS AND CONTENT OF THE NEW POLITICAL THINKING.

HE SAID THAT ALMOST 1,000 ACTIVISTS AND MEMBERS OF THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY AND THE PATRIOTIC UNION HAVE DIED DURING THE RECENT YEARS KILLED BY ASSASSINS HIRED BY THE REACTION. IN THIS CONNECTION THE GUEST POINTED OUT THE NEED OF ACTIVATION AND BROADENING OF INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY IN DEFENCE OF THE PROGRESSIVE, PATRIOTIC AND DEMOCRATIC FORCES IN COLOMBIA, SOLIDARITY WITH THE STRUGGLE OF THE PEOPLE'S MASSES IN THE STRUGGLE FOR PRESERVATION OF DEMOCRACY, FOR PEACE AND SOCIAL PROGRESS. MR MANUEL CEPEDA HAD A MEETING WITH MR RADOSLAV RADEV, EDITOR IN CHIEF OF THE RABOTNICHESKO DELO DAILY. THEY DISCUSSED THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR BROADENING OF THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE PAPERS OF THE BCP AND THE PCC.
DEV-MUC3-0164	CLANDESTINE, 6 APR 89 -- THE FUTURE ARENA GOVERNMENT IS ILLEGAL BECAUSE THE RESULTS OF THE 19 MARCH ELECTION, MORE SO THAN IN ANY OTHER PAST ELECTION, DO NOT REPRESENT THE WISHES OF THE MAJORITY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. THOSE ELECTIONS WERE MARKED BY ABSTENTION AS A RESULT OF THE REJECTION OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT PEACE PROPOSAL. THOSE ELECTIONS WERE HELD WHILE THERE WAS A WAR AND WHILE THE COUNTRY WAS DIVIDED. THIS CLEARLY SHOWED THE DUALITY OF POWER THAT EXISTS. THIS CLEARLY SHOWED THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE ARE DEMANDING A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE WAR. WITHOUT NEGOTIATION, NO ONE CAN RULE IN EL SALVADOR. THEREFORE, A MILITARY SOLUTION OR THE SURRENDER OF THE FMLN IS NOT POSSIBLE. THE FUTURE GOVERNMENT HAS TWO OPTIONS: TO BE A GOVERNMENT THAT WILL INCREASE THE WAR OR TO BE A GOVERNMENT THAT WILL MOVE TOWARD PEACE. THE FMLN JOINS ALL THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL FORCES THAT EXPRESSED THEIR CONCERN FOR ARENA'S COMING TO POWER. WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN ITS CAMPAIGN IN WHICH THEY ARE TRYING TO PRESENT THEMSELVES AS MODERATES. IN LESS THAN 20 DAYS, AND WITHOUT FORMALLY ASSUMING POWER, THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN REPRESSION AND SOCIAL TENSION, AS HAS BEEN EXPRESSED IN DOZENS OF MISSING PERSONS, MURDERS, AND ARRESTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. LABOR UNION OFFICES AND THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY CAMPUS HAVE BEEN CORDONED OFF; CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS; GRENADES AND BOMBS HAVE BEEN EXPLODED IN PUBLIC PLACES; AND THE FMLN IS BLAMED FOR THOSE ATTACKS. JOURNALISTS HAVE BEEN MURDERED; THERE HAS BEEN A SYSTEMATIC INTIMIDATION OF THE PRESS AND ATTEMPTS TO CURB FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION; AND MEMBERS OF THE DEATH SQUADS LINKED TO ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON HAVE BEEN RELEASED FROM PRISON. THERE HAVE BEEN THREATS OF SEIZING LAND THAT BELONGS TO COOPERATIVES; THERE HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT THE BANKING SYSTEM AND FOREIGN TRADE WILL BE PRIVATIZED AND THAT MANY GOVERNMENT WORKERS WILL BE FIRED. THERE IS A CLIMATE OF TERROR THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THIS CLIMATE OF TERROR IS THE RESULT OF THE ARROGANCE AND THE DESIRE FOR REVENGE ON THE PART OF ARENA AND SECTORS OF THE ARMED FORCES. ARENA HAS CLEARLY STATED THAT IT WILL HAVE A POLICY OF KILLINGS AND TOTAL WARFARE AND HAS GIVEN NO SIGN OF WANTING PEACE. IT IS URGENT THAT AN ADEQUATE FRAMEWORK FOR DIALOGUE BE CREATED. THIS MEANS ARENA MUST: 1. CEASE ALL KILLINGS, ARRESTS, DISAPPEARANCES, AND TERRORIST ATTACKS ON CIVILIANS; IT MUST RESPECT THE PRESS AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND PUT AN END TO MILITARIZATION OF WORKPLACES, MILITARY CORDONS, AND ALL REPRESSIVE ACTIONS PERPETRATED BY THE ARMED FORCES AND THE DEATH SQUADS. 2. ARENA MUST RESPECT THE NATIONALIZATION OF BANKS, FOREIGN TRADE, AND AGRARIAN REFORM. IT MUST ENSURE THAT COOPERATIVES' PROPERTY WILL BE RESPECTED; THAT THERE WILL BE NO APPROPRIATION HEARINGS INVOLVING PEOPLE WHO HAVE BENEFITED FROM AGRARIAN REFORM; AND THAT THERE WILL BE NO ECONOMIC MEASURES AIMED AT FORCING THOSE PEOPLE INTO BANKRUPTCY OR INTO SELLING THEIR LAND. LIKEWISE, ARENA MUST PROMISE THAT THERE WILL BE NO MASS DISMISSALS OF GOVERNMENT WORKERS. 3. ARENA MUST PROMISE A REAL DIALOGUE AND NOT A USELESS DIALOGUE AIMED AT BRINGING ABOUT THE FMLN'S SURRENDER. ARENA, AND THE SECTORS IT REPRESENTS, HAS AND ALWAYS HAS HAD REAL POWER. THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THAT HAPPENS IN THE COUNTRY. THEY CANNOT CLAIM, AS SALVADORAN PRESIDENT JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE AND THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAVE CLAIMED, A LACK OF AUTHORITY TO CONTROL REPRESSION OR A LACK OF POWER TO NEGOTIATE. ARENA HAS ECONOMIC, JUDICIAL, AND LEGISLATIVE POWER AND IT HAS EVEN SEIZED POWER IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. ARENA HAS ITS OWN PARAMILITARY FORCES, DEATH SQUADS, AND CONTROLS AN IMPORTANT SECTOR OF THE ARMED FORCES.
DEV-MUC3-0165	SANTIAGO, 7 APR 89 -- THE BOMB ATTACK ON THE CHILEAN--U.S. CULTURAL INSTITUTE IN SANTIAGO HAS CAUSED CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE. POLICE HAVE REPORTED NO VICTIMS. THE SHOCK WAVE, HOWEVER, HAS DAMAGED THE INSTITUTE'S WINDOWS AND THOSE OF SEVERAL NEARBY HOUMES. THE CHILEAN-U.S. CULTURAL INSTITUTE IS LOCATED AT 1475 MONEDA STREET IN THE CENTER OF DONWTOWN SANTIAGO. THE POWERFUL BOMB, WHICH WAS PLACED AT THE INSTITUTE'S MAIN ENTRANCE, DAMAGED A CAR PARKED NEARBY. ALL THE GLASS IN THE CAR, LICENCE PLATE NO. GP 7720, WAS DESTROYED. POLICE BOMB-SQUAD EXPERTS CALLED TO THE SITE ARE NOW INVESTIGATING THE ATTACK.
DEV-MUC3-0166	PANAMA CITY , 8 APR 89 -- NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA SAAVEDRA TODAY CRITICIZED THE RATIFICATION OF A BILATERAL MILITARY AID AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND HONDURAS BECAUSE, HE SAID, IT DEALS A BLOW TO THE PEACE AGREEMENT SIGNED IN EL SALVADOR IN FEBRUARY. AT THAT MEETING, THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ASKED GOVERNMENTS BOTH IN AND OUTSIDE THE REGION THAT OPENLY OR COVERTLY PROVIDE AID TO UNCONVENTIONAL FORCES TO IMMEDIATELY HALT THEIR AID. ON 29 MARCH, THE U.S. AND HONDURAN GOVERNMENTS RATIFIED THE ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL OF A BILATERAL MILITARY AID AGREEMENT. THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT MADE THESE REMARKS DURING TODAY'S INAUGURATION OF A HYDROELECTRICAL PROJECT IN ASTURIAS, JINOTEGA, NORTHERN NICARAGUA, THAT WILL SAVE THE COUNTRY APPROXIMATELY 200,000 BARRELS OF OIL EVERY YEAR. ORTEGA SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES CANNOT CRITICIZE THE ARMS BUILDUP IN THE REGION WHILE IT PROMOTES MILITARY MANEUVERS AND BRINGS WEAPONRY INTO CENTRAL AMERICA, PARTICULARLY INTO HONDURAS. THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT THE PRESENCE OF U.S. TROOPS IN HONDURAS HEIGHTENS TENSION IN THE REGION AND DEALS A BLOW TO THE EL SALVADOR AGREEMENT. THE HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT INAUGURATED TODAY IS LOCATED IN APANAS LAKE, JINOTEGA DEPARTMENT. IT WILL SEND ELECTRIC POWER TO THE CENTRAL AMERICA AND CARLOS FONSECA PLANTS, WHICH TOGETHER WILL PRODUCE OVER 4 MILLION KILOWATTS OF ELECTRICITY AN HOUR. ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL SOURCE, LATIN AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN CAPITAL WAS USED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ASTURIAS PROJECT, WHICH TOOK 5 YEARS TO COMPLETE.
DEV-MUC3-0167	MANAGUA , 10 APR 89 -- A MILITARY PATRIOTIC SERVICE YOUTH WAS KILLED AND A SECOND ONE INJURED DURING A HONDURAN ARMY ATTACK AT EL PASO NARANJO, SOMOTILLO, CHINANDEGA DEPARTMENT. NICARAGUAN MINISTRY REPORTED THAT A ARMY PATROL ATTACKED A NICARAGUAN UNIT WAS CONDUCTING ITS ROUTINE PATROLS. HONDURAN TROOPS USED M-79 GRENADE LAUNCHERS, KILLING YOUTH MENDEZ AND WOUNDING YOUTH MARTINEZ.
DEV-MUC3-0168	MANAGUA , 7 APR 89 -- COMMANDER ARCE HAS DECRIBED THE OPPOSITION'S TRIP TO GUATEMALA AS A "BLUNDER" AND SAID THAT IT WOULD BE REGRETTABLE IF THE POLITICAL PARTIES WENT TO THAT MEETING TO LOOK FOR A "LEADER" TO CONFRONT THE SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT FROM AMONG THOSE COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY CHIEFTAINS. ARCE, A MEMBER OF THE DIRECTORATE, INSISTED THAT THE OPPOSITION'S MEETING WITH THE MERCENARIES IS A "BLUNDER" FROM ANY POINT OF VIEW SINCE WHICHEVER PARTY DECIDES TO BE THE UMBRELLA ORGANIZATION FOR ALL THESE GROUPS WILL NOT GAIN ANY PRESTIGE. NONETHELESS, HE SAID THE BEST THING WOULD BE FOR THE CONTRAS TO FIND OUT WHO WILL BE THE STEPPING STONE FOR THEM TO ENTER THE COUNTRY, INASMUCH AS IT IS A DEFEATED MERCENARY FORCE THAT HAS BEEN UNMASKED AS DEPENDENT ON THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. "I DO NOT BELIEVE THEY HAVE THE NERVE TO SAY THAT THEY ARE NOW A POLITICAL PARTY, AND THAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO WILL BE THEIR STEPPING STONE IN ORDER FOR THEM TO JOIN THE CIVIC STRUGGLE NOW THAT THE THE WAR OPTION HAS BEEN DEFEATED," HE ADDED. THE SANDINIST LEADER INSISTED THAT IF THE OPPOSITION GOES TO GUATEMALA TO LOOK FOR A "LEADER" TO CONFRONT THE IN THE ELECTIONS, THIS WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT THE POLITICAL PARTIES ARE WEAK. HE ADDED THE CONTRA CHIEFTAINS DO NOT HAVE THE QUALIFICATIONS TO BECOME PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES SINCE THEY ARE MORE CRIMINAL THAN THE COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES THEMSELVES WHO CARRY OUT AMBUSHES, WHILE THEIR CHEIFTAINS SIT IN LUXURY HOTELS IN TEGUCIGALPA, SAN JOSE, MIAMI, AND WASHINGTON ENCOURAGING THE AGGRESSION AGAINST THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE. WHEN ASKED ABOUT FSLN ACTIVITIES FOR THE NEXT ELECTION CAMPAIGN, ARCE SAID THAT HIS PARTY IS NOT OUT PREPARING FOR ELECTIONS BUT IS CONTINUING TO WORK TOWARD THE FULFILLMENT OF ALL THE TASKS THAT THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE ARE CARRYING OUT, PARTICULARLY THE STRUGGLE FOR PEACE AND FOR THE ECONOMY. WE WILL PREPARE OUR FORCES FOR THE FEBRUARY 1990 ELECTIONS, BUT FIRST WE HAVE THE TASKS AHEAD FOR CELEBRATING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE REVOLUTION, HE ADDED. THE COMMITTEE THAT WILL ORGANIZE THE CELEBRATIONS WILL BE ANNOUNCED ON 19 APRIL. ARCE SAID THAT THE NEXT ELECTION CAMPAIGN MIGHT BE MORE "INTERESTING" IF THE PARTIES THAT BELIEVED THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD DEFEAT THE REVOLUTION MILITARILY AND ABSTAINED FROM THE 1984 ELECTION WOULD DECIDE TO JOIN THE CIVIC STRUGGLE. DUE TO THE PEACE EFFORTS OF THE REVOLUTION, EVEN THE CONTRAS COULD PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS, AND WE WILL FIND OUT WHO'S WHO AND EACH PARTY WILL BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN WHAT IT HAS DONE FOR THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE, THE SANDINIST LEADER SAID.
DEV-MUC3-0169	QUITO, 11 APR 89 -- THE MARCH ORGANIZED BY FORMER ECUADORAN PRESIDENT LEON FEBRES CORDERO AND HIS SUPPORTERS HAS TAKEN PLACE IN GUAYAQUIL WITHOUT MAJOR INCIDENT BECAUSE THE SMALL GROUP OF DEMONSTRATORS WAS CONTROLLED BY MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL POLICE POSTED ALONG 9 OCTOBER AVENUE, THE SITE OF THE DISTURBANCE. FORMER PRESIDENT LEON FEBRES CORDERO, HIS WIFE, AND SEVERAL OF HIS CLOSE SUPPORTERS MARCHED DOWN THE PORT CITY'S MAIN AVENUE FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN, ACCORDING TO REPORTS FROM HIS NEIGHBORS, WENT TO HIS HOUSE. THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND HIS CLOSE FRIENDS HAVE REMAINED INSIDE THE HOUSE SINCE 1705. THE DISTURBANCES IN GUAYAQUIL RESULTED IN TWO INJURIES. ONE OF THE INJURED PERSONS IS 1ST COMPANY POLICEMAN LUIS CASTRO ROMAN, WHO HAS BEEN ADMITTED TO LUIS VERNAZA HOSPITAL. POLICEMAN CASTRO ROMAN WAS SHOT BY ONE OF THE DEMONSTRATORS. THE BULLET LODGED IN THE RIGHT SIDE OF HIS CHEST. THE BLOODY INCIDENT OCCURRED ON BOYACA AND 9 OCTOBER AVENUES. ALSO INJURED DURING THE DEMONSTRATION WAS A CITIZEN WHO HAS NOT BEEN INDENTIFIED. SOURCES CLOSE TO THE GOVERNMENT HAVE REPORTED THAT THE NATIONAL POLICE DID NOT USE FIREARMS DURING THE DEMONSTRATION. LEON FEBRES CORDERO'S MARCH IN GUAYAQUIL BEGAN AT 1600 WITH A VERY SMALL GROUP OF PERSONS. THE GROUP GATHERED ON BOYACA AND 9 OCTOBER AVENUES. THE DEMONSTRATORS BEGAN THEIR MARCH BUT WERE IMMEDIATELY CONTROLLED BY THE POLICE WITH THE USE OF TEAR GAS AND WATER. FEBRES CORDERO'S WIFE WAS ALSO PRESENT ON 9 OCTOBER AVENUE; SHE WALKED A SHORT DISTANCE TO MEET HER HUSBAND. THEY THEN LEFT THE AREA WHERE THE DISTURBANCE TOOK PLACE. IN CONCLUSION, THE DEMONSTRATION PLANNED BY THE SOCIAL CHRISTIANS AND FORMER PRESIDENT FEBRES CORDERO'S SUPPORTERS RESULTED IN TWO INJURIES.
DEV-MUC3-0170	MANAGUA , 13 APR 89 -- THE GROUP OF 14 OPPOSITION PARTY DELEGATES HAVE RETURNED FROM GUATEMALA, WHERE THEY SIGNED AN ALLIANCE AGREEMENT WITH THE COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES AND HOSTED A NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS CLUB IN MANAGUA. GUILLERMO POTOY, DELEGATE FROM THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY, SAID THAT THE CONTRAS ARE WILLING TO LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS IF THERE IS DEMOCRATIZATION IN THE COUNTRY. I BELIEVE THAT THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE WOULD BE WILLING TO COME TO NICARAGUA. JUDGING FROM WHAT THEY SAID, I BELIEVE THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO RETURN ONCE IT APPEARS THAT THERE IS DEMOCRATIZATION. THEY TRUST THE 14 OR 15 OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES AND SUPPORT THE DECISIONS MADE BY THESE PARTIES CONCERNING THE ELECTIONS. IN EL SALVADOR, THE WAR INTENSIFIED DURING THE ELECTIONS, AND THOSE WHO FINANCED THE WAR CONTINUED TO FINANCE IT IN ORDER TO . IN NICARAGUA, THE HUMANITARIAN AID ENSURES THAT NOT A SINGLE SHOT WILL BE FIRED. I BELIEVE THIS IS A POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION. WE MUST BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING, WHICH IS WHERE WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN, AND NOT WHERE WE ARE NOW. JUST LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE NOW. WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS IN NICARAGUA? THERE HAS BEEN PLENTY OF WAR, MANY DEATHS. NOW A PEACE PROCESS HAS BEGUN IN NICARAGUA. THIS HELPS ENSURE THAT NOT A SINGLE SHOT WILL BE FIRED AND THAT THE ELECTIONS WILL BE HELD IN PEACE. THEN WE NICARAGUANS WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLY. IT IS UP TO THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT TO INSTITUTE DEMOCRACY IN NICARAGUA, WHICH WILL ENSURE AN AUTOMATIC END TO THE WAR. I BELIEVE THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE, THE NICARAGUAN CIVIC OPPOSITION, WOULD NOT BE WILLING TO JOIN ANY EFFORT ONCE DEMOCRACY HAS BEEN ACHIEVED IN NICARAGUA.
DEV-MUC3-0171	SOFIA , 12 APR 89 -- POLITICAL LIFE IN COLOMBIA IS STILL LINKED WITH VIOLENCE..... COLOMBIA IS EXPERIENCING AN EXTREMELY SEVERE POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CRISIS, CAUSED BY THE INCOMPATIBILITY BETWEEN THE FAST DEVELOPING PRODUCTIVE FORCES AND THE EXISTING POLITICAL SETUP. FOR EXAMPLE, LAST YEAR COLOMBIA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH WAS 4.5 PERCENT. HOWEVER, POLITICAL LIFE CONTINUES TO BE DOMINATED BY THE TWO OLD PARTIES -- THE LIBERALS AND THE CONSERVATIVES, WHO MAINTAIN A MERELY FORMAL DEMOCRACY. WE SHOULD NOT FORGET COLOMBIA'S STRATEGIC POSITION: IT FORMS A BRIDGE BETWEEN CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA. ALL EVENTS IN COLOMBIA AFFECT THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES. PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THIS, THE SO-CALLED "SANTA FE-2" DOCUMENT, DRAWN UP BY EXTREME RIGHT-WING U.S. POLITICIANS, CONTAINS A PLAN TO APPLY PRESSURE IN COLOMBIA AND, MORE SPECIFICALLY, TO EXPAND THE SO-CALLED LOW-INTENSITY CONFLICT, ONE OF WHOSE MANIFESTATIONS IS THE SO-CALLED "DIRTY WAR" IN THE COUNTRY. ACCORDINGLY, THE VIOLENCE IN COLOMBIA IS CAUSED BY BOTH INTERNAL FACTORS -- THE CRISIS OF THE INSTITUTIONS -- AND EXTERNAL ONES, NAMELY THE POLICIES OF THE MOST REACTIONARY CIRCLES IN THE UNITED STATES. CAN ONE EXPECT THE PEACE SETTLEMENT TO BE FULFILLED UNDER THESE CONDITIONS? THIS IS THE AIM OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF COLOMBIA . AT OUR RECENT 15TH CONGRESS, WE MADE A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION AND CONCLUDED THAT THE CONFLICT IN COLOMBIA MUST BE SETTLED BY POLITICAL MEANS. THE PCC RAISED THE QUESTION OF REMOVING THE SIEGE SITUATION THAT, WITH A FEW INTERRUPTIONS, HAS BEEN MAINTAINED FOR SEVERAL DECADES, AND OF DISBANDING THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS . THESE GROUPS OWE THEIR VERY EXISTENCE TO THE SUPPORT GIVEN BY MILITARY CIRCLES AND THE CLAN CHIEFS TO THE TRADE IN NARCOTICS. ONE OF THE PCC'S DEMANDS IS THAT THE ARMY SHOULD BE PURGED OF FASCIST ELEMENTS AND THAT A CIVILIAN SHOULD BE PUT IN CHARGE OF THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE. THE PARTY ALSO RAISED THE QUESTION OF MAKING A START ON THE NECESSARY DEMOCRATIC REFORMS, BUT THE GOVERNMENT PAYS NO HEED TO OUR DEMANDS. THE GOVERNMENT RECENTLY REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH "M-19," ONE OF THE PARTISAN GROUPINGS IN THE COUNTRY, BUT DID NOT ACCEPT ANY COMMITMENTS IN PRACTICE. ACCORDINGLY, THERE ARE SOME DOUBTS OVER HOW THE LIVES OF THE PARTISAN LEADERS WILL BE SUBSEQUENTLY GUARANTEED. THE LARGEST PARTISAN GROUP -- THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA -- IS DEMANDING THAT THE GOVERNMENT TAKE SERIOUS STEPS TO LIMIT THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS, IN ORDER TO CONCLUDE A TRUCE. CLEARLY, IT WILL NOT BE EASY TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN COLOMBIA. AT THE MOMENT, PEACE SUPPORTERS IN COLOMBIA ARE FORMING A BROAD FRONT, WHICH IN PRACTICE HAS AN ANTIFASCIST ORIENTATION. PEACE DEPENDS ON HOW FAR THIS FRONT WILL SUCCEED IN EXPANDING, HOW THE CONTRADICTIONS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF REGARDING THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS WILL DEEPEN, AND ON WHETHER WE WILL SUCCEED IN ISOLATING THEM. WE ARE OPTIMISTS, BUT ALSO HAVE A GREAT NEED OF INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY. HOW DO YOU ASSESS THE POLITICAL PROSPECTS FOR THE UNITED LEFT IN YOUR COUNTRY? THE LEFT FORCES IN COLOMBIA ARE UNITED IN THE PATRIOTIC UNION THAT WAS CREATED 4 YEARS AGO. ITS AIM IS TO ACHIEVE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION IN OUR COUNTRY. HOWEVER, THE UNION IMMEDIATELY BECAME A TARGET OF THE ORGANIZERS OF THE "DIRTY WAR." HUNDREDS OF ITS LEADERS WERE BEATEN UP, MANY OF WHOM WERE PCC MEMBERS. SO FAR, OVER 1,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED, INCLUDING JAIME PARDO LEAL, LEADER OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION, DEPUTY CHAIRMAN JOSE ANTEGUERA, AND OTHERS. THREATS CONTINUE TO BE MADE AGAINST THE UNION AND AGAINST THE PCC. ALL MEMBERS OF THE PCC LEADERSHIP HAVE RECEIVED DEATH THREATS. THE SAME ALSO APPLIES TO BERNARDO JARAMILLO, THE PRESENT LEADER OF THE UNION, GILBERTO VIEIRA, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PCC CENTRAL COMMITTEE, AND OTHERS. ON 27 FEBRUARY COMRADE FORERO , PCC SECRETARY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS, WAS KILLED. HIS WIFE AND COMRADES SOTELO AND SOTOMAYOR ALSO DIED IN THE ATROCITY. NEXT DAY, WE HAD A MEETING WITH VIRGILIO BARCO, PRESIDENT OF COLOMBIA. HE PROMISES TO TAKE SPEEDY MEASURES AGAINST THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS. HOWEVER, ONLY 4 DAYS LATER, ANTEGUERA, THE FORMER LEADER OF THE UNION OF COMMUNIST YOUTH, WAS KILLED AT BOGOTA AIRPORT. SENATOR ERNESTO PISANO, ONE OF THE LIBERAL PARTY CANDIDATES FOR THE PRESIDENCY, WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED AT THE SAME TIME. MANY MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY WERE PRESENT AT THE AIRPORT ON THAT DAY, AS WELL AS THE POLICE CHIEF OF THE CAPITAL, YET ONLY ONE OF THE MURDERERS WAS KILLED, WHILE THE REST ESCAPED. THIS IS WHY WE TOLD PRESIDENT BARCO THAT WE HAD SERIOUS DOUBTS ABOUT THE ARMY'S ROLE IN THIS ASSASSINATION. NEXT YEAR, PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS AND ELECTIONS OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODIES ARE DUE TO TAKE PLACE IN COLOMBIA. THE PCC AND THE PATRIOTIC UNION WANT TO TAKE PART IN THEM, BUT WE HAVE WARNED THE LEADERS OF THE REPUBLIC THAT UNLESS THE "DIRTY WAR" IS ENDED, WE WILL EXPOSE THE SITUATION IN COLOMBIA TO THE WORLD AND REGARD THE ELECTION RESULTS AS ILLEGAL. DESPITE EVERYTHING, WE CONSIDER THAT THE PATRIOTIC UNION HAS A PROMISING FUTURE, BECAUSE ITS AIMS ARE SUPPORTED BY THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE.
DEV-MUC3-0172	BOGOTA, 14 APR 89 -- PRESIDENT BARCO VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED COLOMBIA'S IMAGE REGARDING ITS STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, TERRORISM, AND COMMON CRIME IN A SPEECH HE GAVE IN WASHINGTON THIS MORNING. HE POINTED TO THE ERADICATION OF ILLITERACY, COMMENTED ON THE NATION'S ECONOMIC INDEXES, AND SAID THAT COUNTLESS COLOMBIANS HAVE BEEN ASSASSINATED IN THEIR STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING. PRESIDENT BARCO INVITED OTHER AREA COUNTRIES TO JOIN EFFORTS TO END DRUG CULTIVATION, TRAFFICKING, AND CONSUMPTION. COLOMBIA CANNOT FIGHT THIS EVIL ALONE, BARCO ASSERTED. HE GAVE SPECIFIC STATISTICS ABOUT BLOWS THAT HAVE BEEN STRUCK AGAINST COLOMBIAN DRUG CARTELS. I CAME TO MAKE AN APPEAL TO YOU. LET US ALL COMBINE OUR EFFORTS AND ENERGIES IN AN ALLIANCE THAT IS STRONGER AND BETTER COORDINATED THAN THAT OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS. WE NEED AN ALLIANCE OF NATIONS AFFECTED BY DRUG TRAFFICKING IN ORDER TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY. DRUG TRAFFICKING IS NOT THE PROBLEM OF A SINGLE NATION, OR EVEN OF A GROUP OF NATIONS. IT IS A UNIVERSAL OUTRAGE. UNLESS WE DEVISE STRONG AND EFFECTIVE MEANS OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION TO FIGHT AGAINST ALL PHASES OF THE PROBLEM, A FINAL VICTORY WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE. FOR THIS REASON, I WISH TO USE THIS FORUM TO MAKE A NEW PROPOSAL TO REFLECT THE SENSE OF URGENCY THAT WE ALL FEEL WITH REGARD TO THIS PROBLEM. WE -- ALL PRESIDENTS OF THE AMERICAN HEMISPHERE, ALONG WITH PRESIDENT BUSH AND OUR OTHER COLLEAGUES OF THOSE NATIONS MOST AFFECTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL DRUG TRAFFICKING SCOURGE -- SHOULD MEET AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO JOINTLY EXERCISE THE PUBLIC, POLITICAL AUTHORITY CONFERRED UPON US BY THE WILL OF OUR PEOPLE. THE COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT REITERATED HIS CONDEMNATION OF WEAPONS PRODUCTION AND TRAFFICKING, HIGHLIGHTED COLOMBIA'S DEMOCRACY, AND SAID THAT HIS COUNTRY WILL INCREASE EFFORTS IN ITS CONTINUED STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.
DEV-MUC3-0173	SAN SALVADOR, 14 APR 89 -- YOU MENTIONED THE ATTACK ON THE RESIDENCE OF VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT FRANCISCO MERINO. WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO GIVE US SOME DETAILS ON THIS. AT APPROXIMATELY 0530 THIS MORNING, THREE EXPLOSIVES WERE HURLED AT HIS RESIDENCE FROM AN EMPTY LOT. THE EXPLOSIVES CAUSED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE RESIDENCE. THERE WAS RIFLE FIRE TOO, BUT THE RIFLE FIRE WAS ONLY TO DISTRACT SECURITY PERSONNEL IN THE AREA. THE ATTACKERS ACTED LIKE ANIMALS. MR MERINO IS STILL IN THE UNITED STATES WITH HIS WIFE. HE WILL BE RETURNING THIS AFTERNOON. THEIR FOUR CHILDREN AND THREE OF THE CHILDREN'S FRIENDS WERE AT THE RESIDENCE WHEN THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE. THE CHILDREN COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED. THOSE WHO CARRIED OUT THIS ATTACK ARE PEOPLE WHO FOR A LONG TIME HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS AND ABOUT INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS. THIS ATTACK ENDANGERED CIVILIANS. THANK GOODNESS ONLY ONE OF THE CHILDREN WAS WOUNDED. ONE OF THE GIRLS WHO WAS VISITING THE HOME WAS HIT BY SOME SHRAPNEL BUT THE WOUND IS NOT SERIOUS. RIGHT NOW WE ARE GETTING A DOCTOR TO EXAMINE THE CHILDREN TO SEE IF THEIR HEARING HAS BEEN DAMAGED BECAUSE TWO OF THE DEVICES EXPLODED IN THE BEDROOM THE CHILDREN WERE IN. I BELIEVE THIS IS ANOTHER INDICATION THAT THE FMLN , FAR FROM SEEKING PEACE AND WANTING PEACE FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WANTS TO CONTINUE ITS TERRORISM, ITS KILLINGS -- ITS IRRATIONAL KILLINGS. I BELIEVE THAT LITTLE CAN BE ACHIEVED IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE THROUGH DIALOGUE BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT SINCERE WHEN THEY CLAIM THAT THEY WANT TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF VIOLENCE. THEY STATED THEIR OPINION ON 19 MARCH. THE FMLN SHOULD THINK CAREFULLY BECAUSE THE PEOPLE HAVE FLATLY REJECTED VIOLENCE AND THE FMLN. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE MEMBERS OF OUR PARTY WILL BE FRIGHTENED INTO ABANDONING THE STRUGGLE FOR THE CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY, WHICH IS SOMETHING THE PEOPLE WANT. I BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO WANT TO MAKE THE FMLN LOOK LIKE MARTYRS AND LIKE PERSONS WHO WORK FOR THE GOOD OF THE PEOPLE, SHOULD KNOW THE TRUTH: THEY ARE NOTHING BUT SAVAGES WHO LACK HUMAN QUALITIES AND WHO ARE INDISCRIMINATELY KILLING AND WOUNDING CIVILIANS WHO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CONFLICT.
DEV-MUC3-0174	TEGUCIGALPA, 16 APR 89 -- ONE MAN WAS KILLED AND ANOTHER SERIOUSLY INJURED THIS EVENING WHEN A POWERFUL EXPLOSIVE THEY WERE ATTEMPTING TO HURL FROM A PASSING MOTORCYCLE AT A U.S. EMBASSY WAREHOUSE IN TEGUCIGALPA EXPLODED BEFORE THEY COULD THROW IT. THE DEAD MAN HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS 39-YEAR-OLD MIGUEL RODOLFO AGUILAR FLORES OF TEGUCIGALPA. HIS BODY WAS BLOWN TO BITS BY THE EXPLOSION. THE WOUNDED MAN HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED. HE WAS ADMITTED IN A SEMICONSCIOUS STATE TO THE BURNS UNIT OF THE ESCUELA HOSPITAL. ACCORDING TO POLICE, THE BOMB WAS CHINESE-MADE AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN DETONATED BY HEAT FROM THE MOTORCYCLE OR FROM FRICTION CREATED AS A RESULT OF BEING PLACE BETWEEN THE TWO MEN ON THE MOTORCYCLE. ANOTHER THEORY IS THAT THE TWO MEN DROPPED THE BOMB WHEN THEY TRIED TO THROW IT AT THE WAREHOUSE, WHICH IS LOCATED 1 KM NORTHWEST OF THE U.S. EMBASSY. POLICE BELIEVE THAT THE BOMB WAS GOING TO BE PLACED IN THE U.S. EMBASSY WAREHOUSE BY MEMBERS OF THE HONDURAN LEFT TO COMMEMMORATE WHAT PEOPLE HERE CALL "BLACK APRIL" FOR THE UNITED STATES. ON 7 APRIL 1988, A MOB SET FIRE TO THE U.S. CONSULATE IN TEGUCIGALPA AND TO 30 DIPLOMATIC VEHICLES.
DEV-MUC3-0175	BUENOS AIRES, 17 APR 89 -- BARRY MELBOURNE SHINING PATH PARTICIPATED IN A MEETING THAT WAS HELD IN A TUCUMAN CITY HOTEL." HE ADDED THAT "MOVEMENTS OF THE MPT HAVE BEEN DETECTED THROUGHOUT THE NORTHWEST REGION OF ARGENTINA, AND WE ARE NOW TRYING TO FIND OUT WHETHER THERE IS ANY TYPE OF CONNECTION" BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. HUSSEY INDICATED THAT "WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE EVENTS, BUT AS ADVISERS TO THE PRESIDENT WE LIMIT OURSELVES TO AN ANALYSIS OF THE MATTER, WHICH WE THEN TURN OVER TO THE INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATIONS SO THAT THEY CAN WORK ON IT." IN REMARKS MADE TO RADIO EL MUNDO, HE STATED THAT "PRESIDENT ALFONSIN IS VERY CONCERNED," AND WHEN ASKED IF AN IMMEDIATE ACTION BY SUBVERSIVE GROUPS IS EXPECTED, HE ANSWERED: "ANYTHING CAN BE EXPECTED FROM THOSE TYPE OF PEOPLE."
DEV-MUC3-0176	LIMA, 17 APR 89 -- THE POLICE HAVE ARRESTED JOSE LUIS FRANCISCO GUTIERREZ, A COLOMBIAN CITIZEN, 28, WHO IS SUSPECTED OF BEING A MEMBER OF THE COLOMBIAN M-19 GUERRILLA GROUP. GUTIERREZ WAS ARRESTED YESTERDAY WHILE TRAVELLING IN A CAR WITH PERUVIAN ENGINEER MIGUEL RINCON RINCON IN WHOSE POSSESSION THE POLICE FOUND SUBVERSIVE PROPAGANDA FROM THE OUTLAWED REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT TUPAC AMARU OF PERU. POLICE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES AFFIRMED HAVE CONFIRMED THE ARREST OF THIS COLOMBIAN CITIZEN AND SAID THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE HE MAY BE THE LIASON BETWEEN THE M-19 AND THE MRTA. TWO YEARS AGO, THESE GROUPS CREATED THE NOW DISMANTLED "AMERICA BATTALLION," WHICH STATED SOME ARMED OPERATION IN COLOMBIAN TERRITORY. THE ARREST OF JOSE LUIS FRANCISCO GUTIERREZ BRINGS TO THREE THE NUMBER OF COLOMBIANS THAT HAVE BEEN SEIZED AND THAT ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE ANTITERRORIST POLICE . HENRY VLADIMIR DELGADO SALAZAR AND JOSE ALZATE CARDONA WERE ARRESTED FOLLOWING THE ARMED ATTACK ON THE POLICE POST AT UCHIZA, IN THE PERUVIAN NORTHEAST, WHERE 10 POLICEMEN WERE KILLED.
DEV-MUC3-0177	BOGOTA, 18 APRIL 89 -- MULTI-PARTY TALKS ON INCORPORATING COLOMBIA'S M-19 REBEL GROUP INTO CIVILIAN LIFE WOUND UP TUESDAY WITH AGREEMENT THAT THE PROCESS MUST BE COMPLETED BY JUNE 30. REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GOVERNMENT, POLITICAL PARTIES AND THE M- 19 GROUP, WHICH ACCEPTED A TRUCE LAST MONTH AFTER 16 YEARS OF FIGHTING, REACHED THE ACCORD AT A "WORKING SESSION" AT THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. NO OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE WAS RELEASED, BUT SOURCES CLOSE TO THE TALKS SAID THE PARTIES HAD AGREED TO CONTINUE BI-WEEKLY PARLEYS AND TO CREATE A GENERAL SECRETARIAT COMPRISING REPRESENTATIVES OF EACH OF THE DELEGATIONS. THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH WAS NAMED AS GUARANTOR OF ANY FINAL AGREEMENT. THE GUERRILLA GROUP SIGNED ITS TRUCE MARCH 18 UNDER A PEACE PLAN ANNOUNCED IN SEPTEMBER BY PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, WHO HAS SAID REBEL LEADERS WOULD BE PARDONED. THE TALKS HAVE YET TO BROACH THE THORNY SUBJECT OF THE 2,500- STRONG GROUP'S HANDING OVER ITS ARMS. THE GUERRILLA GROUP WAS FORMED IN SEPTEMBER 1973 AS A PROTEST AGAINST WHAT IT SAID WAS ELECTORAL FRAUD COMMITTED BY THEN- STRONGMAN GUSTAVO ROJAS PINILLA. ITS ORIGINAL MEMBERS WERE DISSIDENT GUERRILLAS FROM OTHER GROUPS, PROFESSIONALS, WORKERS, STUDENTS AND FORMER SOLDIERS. IN JANUARY 1974, THE REBEL GROUP MADE HEADLINES BY STEALING A SWORD THAT HAD BELONGED TO SIMON BOLIVAR -- WHO LED THE WARS OF INDEPENDENCE IN MOST OF NORTHERN SOUTH AMERICA -- WHICH THEY PROMISED TO USE TO "REDEEM" THE COUNTRY. M-19'S MOST SPECTACULAR OPERATION WAS ITS 1985 TAKEOVER OF THE PALACE OF JUSTICE IN BOGOTA. IN THE MILITARY OPERATION TO RETAKE THE BUILDING, MORE THAN 100 PEOPLE DIED, INCLUDING SIX TOP JUDGES AS WELL AS VISITORS, EMPLOYEES AND REBELS. THE REBELS WERE REPORTEDLY HIRED BY DRUG KINGPINS TO STORM THE BUILDING AND DESTROY DOCUMENTS TO BE USED IN PROCEEDINGS TO EXTRADITE THE DRUG LORDS TO THE UNITED STATES.
DEV-MUC3-0178	TEGUCIGALPA, 19 APR 89 -- HONDURAN GUERRILLAS CLAIMED CREDIT TODAY FOR THE ATTACK ON A U.S. ARMY CONVOY ON 11 APRIL IN NORTHERN HONDURAS IN WHICH ONE PERSON WAS KILLED, THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE WOUNDED, AND ONE VEHICLE DESTROYED. THE ATTACK ON AN 11-VEHICLE CONVOY CARRYING U.S. AND HONDURAN SOLDIERS TOOK PLACE 17 KM NORTHEAST OF OLANCHITO, IN YORO DEPARTMENT, ON THE NORTHERN COAST OF HONDURAS. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT U.S. AND HONDURAN TROOPS ARE BUILDING A HIGHWAY FOR MILITARY EMERGENCIES AND CIVIL DEVELOPMENT IN THIS AREA. IN A COMMUNIQUE DISTRIBUTED IN OLANCHITO, THE MORAZANIST PATRIOTIC FRONT CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE ATTACK, AND SAID THE ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT BY THE RAMON AMAYA AMADOR COMMANDO GROUP . THE GUERRILLA COMMUNIQUE STATED "THE ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT WITH RIFLE FIRE AND HAND GRENADES, WHICH NEUTRALIZED THE REARGUARD OF THE YANKEE CONVOY AND RESULTED IN ONE DEAD, THREE OR FOUR WOUNDED, AND ONE DESTROYED VEHICLE." THE COMMUNIQUE ADDED THAT "THE YANKEES REFUSE TO REPORT THEIR CASUALTIES SO AS NOT TO DEMORALIZE THEIR TROOPS. OUR RIFLES WILL BE AIMED AT THE BLONDS FROM THE NORTH WHO ARE TODAY TRAMPLING ON OUR SACRED FATHERLAND." THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES AND THE U.S. EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA HAVE CONFIRMED THE ATTACK, BUT THEY DID NOT MENTION ANY CASUALTIES, ALTHOUGH THEY ADMIT THAT THE LAST VEHICLE IN THE CONVOY WAS "DAMAGED" BY AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE THAT WAS HURLED AT IT. ON 1 FEBRUARY, ANOTHER U.S. MILITARY CONVOY WAS ATTACKED IN THE SAME AREA BY UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS, WITHOUT CAUSING ANY CASUALTIES BUT DAMAGING ONE TRUCK. THAT ATTACK WAS ALSO CLAIMED BY THE FPM, WHICH SAID IT HAD WOUNDED SOME AMERICANS. THE FPM FIRST APPEARED IN SAN PEDRO SULA IN 1979 AND HAS TAKEN CREDIT FOR SEVERAL DYNAMITE ATTACKS AND RURAL GUERRILLA ACTIONS. RAMON AMAYA AMADOR, THE NAME USED BY THE HONDURAN GUERRILLA GROUP, WAS A LEFTIST NOVELIST WHO WROTE ABOUT THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC INEQUALITIES AMONG HONDURANS. HE ALSO CONDEMNED FOREIGN INTERVENTION, PARTICULARLY U.S. INTERVENTION, IN HONDURAN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL AFFAIRS.
DEV-MUC3-0179	SAN SALVADOR, 19 APR 89 -- A SELF-NAMED ULTRA-RIGHT-WING COMMANDO UNIT, THE "GERARDO BARRIOS CIVIC FORCE" TONIGHT CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DYNAMITE ATTACK THAT KILLED SALVADORAN ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIA TODAY. IN TELEPHONE CALLS TO LOCAL RADIO STATIONS, THE COMMANDO UNIT STATED: "WE WERE BORN THROUGH ANTISUBVERSIVE COMBAT; HOWEVER, WE ARE AN ESSENTIALLY DEMOCRATIC FORCE, BECAUSE WE HAVE COME TO CONFRONT THE MONOPOLIZING AND TOTALITARIAN EFFORTS OF ARENA , WHICH WILL BE THE RULING PARTY AS OF 1 JUNE." THE NEW "DEATH SQUAD" SPOKESMAN SAID: "WE ARE CONFRONTING THE WORTHLESS MERINO AND D'AUBUISSON. WE RECENTLY GAVE THEM A DISSUASIVE SIGNAL, AND TODAY WE GAVE THEM A SECOND ONE..." LAST WEEK FRANCISCO MERINO'S RESIDENCE WAS THE TARGET OF A BOMB ATTACK, THOUGH THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES . "WE ARE AGAINST EVERY ACT OF INTRIGUE AND CONSPIRACY WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES AND CURRENT ACTS OF REPRESSION BY THE STATE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS, AS WELL AS ALL ACTIONS AGAINST DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRACY." IN CONCLUSION, THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS A VEILED THREAT AGAINST FRANCISCO GUERRERO, PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE, WHO IS CHARGED WITH A "FIFTH COLUMN ACTION." THIS IS THE SECOND "DEATH SQUAD" THAT HAS MADE ITS APPEARANCE IN THE COUNTRY IN LESS THAN A WEEK. ON 14 APRIL, SHORTLY AFTER THE ATTACK ON MERINO, THE SELF-STYLED "GUARDIANS OF FREE ENTERPRISE" MADE ITS APPEARANCE AND HARSHLY CRITICIZED THE CHIEFS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY WHO "OBEY PRESSURES FROM ABROAD."
DEV-MUC3-0180	TEGUCIGALPA, 19 APR 89 -- THE LEFTIST MORAZANIST PATRIOTIC FRONT TODAY SAID THAT IT KILLED A U.S. SOLDIER AND WOUNDED "THREE OR FOUR MORE" DURING AN ATTACK ON A MILITARY CONVOY IN NORTHERN YORO DEPARTMENT ON 11 APRIL. IN A COMMUNIQUE SENT TO LOCAL RADIO STATIONS, THE MORAZANIST PATRIOTIC FRONT SAID THEY ATTACKED THE U.S. TROOPS, WHICH FOR THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTING MANEUVERS IN THE NORTHERN REGION, WITH RIFLE FIRE AND GRENADES, MANAGING TO "NEUTRALIZE THE YANKEE CONVOY'S REARGUARD, KILLING ONE SOLDIER AND WOUNDING THREE OR FOUR. HOWEVER, SPOKESPERSONS FOR THE ARMED FORCES PUBLIC RELATIONS DIRECTORATE TODAY REITERATED THAT ONLY MATERIAL DAMAGE WAS REPORTED IN THE ATTACK AGAINST THE MILITARY CONVOY. THE MORAZANIST FRONT ALSO SAID THAT ON 1 FEBRUARY, IN ANOTHER ATTACK CARRIED OUT IN YORO DEPARTMENT, IT INFLICTED CASUALTIES ON U.S. ARMY TROOPS. THIS CLANDESTINE ORGANIZATION WAS CREATED IN THE MID-SEVENTIES, BUT ITS OPERATIONS WITHIN HONDURAS ARE SPORADIC.
DEV-MUC3-0181	LIMA, 20 APR 89 -- FOREIGN MINISTER ALOIS MOCK CONDEMNED THE KILLING OF 42-YEAR-OLD JOSEF PIESCHER, A VIENNA DEVELOPMENT WORKER IN PERU, AS A "WICKED TERRORIST ATTACK ON A MAN OF GOODWILL," WHO HAD ALTRUISTICALLY PLACED HIMSELF IN THE SERVICE OF DEVELOPMENT AID. THE AUSTRIAN AMBASSADOR IN LIMA HAS BEEN ORDERED TO URGE THE PERUVIAN AUTHORITIES TO SPEED UP INVESTIGATIONS OF THE MURDER. ON TUESDAY A PERUVIAN RADIO STATION REPORTED THAT THE GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION SHINING PATH HAD KILLED PIESCHER BECAUSE THEY TOOK HIM FOR AN AGENT OF THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE SERVICE, CIA. IN AN INTERVIEW FOR THE AUSTRIA PRESS AGENCY, HEINRICH STEMBERGER, VIENNA UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR FOR TROPICAL MEDICINE AND CHAIRMAN OF THE AMAZON AID ASSOCIATION, CALLED THIS ACCUSATION "COMPLETE NONSENSE." IN HIS STATEMENT MOCK EXPRESSED THE EXPECTATION THAT THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES WILL DO EVERYTHING TO MEET THE AUSTRIAN INTEREST IN CLEARING UP THE MATTER QUICKLY. HE EXPRESSED "DEEP DISMAY AND SHOCK" ABOUT THE ASSOCIATION AND EXPRESSED HIS SYMPATHY TO PIESCHER'S RELATIVES. ON WEDNESDAY MORNING UDO EHRLICH-ADAM, THE AUSTRIAN AMBASSADOR TO PERU, STATED THAT THE INCIDENT WAS THE FOURTH MURDER OF A PERSON INVOLVED IN FOREIGN AID PROJECTS SINCE LAST JUNE.
DEV-MUC3-0182	SAN SALVADOR, 20 APR 89 -- REGARDING THIS MORNING'S ATTACK AGAINST SALVADORAN ATTORNEY GENERAL DR ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO, A GROUP CALLING ITSELF THE GERARDO BARRIOS COMMANDO UNIT TONIGHT CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK. WE WILL NOW BROADCAST A TELEPHONE CALL THAT ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE PRESS DEPARTMENT RECEIVED FROM A PERSON WHO IDENTIFIED HIMSELF ONLY AS A MEMBER OF THIS NEW GUERRILLA COMMANDO UNIT OR DEATH SQUAD. OUR FORCE IS CALLED THE GERARDO BARRIOS CIVIC FORCE. WE WERE BORN MAINLY THROUGH ANTISUBVERSIVE COMBAT; HOWEVER, WE ARE AN ESSENTIALLY DEMOCRATIC FORCE, BECAUSE WE ARE OPPOSED TO... WE HAVE CONFRONTED THE MONOPOLIZING AND TOTALITARIAN EFFORTS OF ARENA . CAN YOU HEAR ME? YES, QUITE CLEARLY. HELLO? I CAN HEAR YOU. PLEASE CONTINUE. WE ARE STRATEGICALLY CONFRONTING THE MANIPULATIONS OF THE WORTHLESS MERINO AND D'AUBUISSON. WE GAVE THEM OUR SECOND DISSUASSIVE SIGNAL TODAY. WE HOPE THEY WILL STOP MANAGING GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS BY RAIDING, REMOVING, APPOINTING, AND BEHEADING PUBLIC OFFICIALS. THIS MUST BE DEALT WITH IN A DIFFERENT FASHION. WE ALSO WANT THEM TO STOP THEIR INTRIGUES AND CONSPIRACIES WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES AND THEIR PRESSURE ON THE STATE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS, AS WELL AS ALL GRIEVOUS ACTIONS AIMED AT DISCREDITING DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRACY. WE ALSO WANT FRANCISCO GUERRERO TO STOP HIS FIFTH-COLUMN ACTION IN THE PCN TO DIVIDE THE PARTY. YOU CANNOT TAKE SUCH ACTIONS AGAINST DEMOCRATIC FORCES. THIS IS A SECOND DISSUASSIVE SIGNAL. CAN YOU HEAR ME? WHAT IS THE SECOND SIGNAL? WELL, ONLY... THIS WAS THE TELEPHONE CALL RECEIVED AT RADIO CADENA YSU'S PRESS DEPARTMENT FROM THIS NEW GROUP THAT CALLS ITSELF THE GERARDO BARRIOS CIVIC FORCE, WHICH HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK ON SALVADORAN ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO.
DEV-MUC3-0183	RIO DE JANEIRO , 20 APR 89 -- THREE OFFICIALS OF BRASPETRO HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED BY A GROUP OF GUERRILLAS FROM THE MEDIO MAGDALENA PETROLEUM BASIN, IN COLOMBIA. THE GUERRILLAS LAST NIGHT ATTACKED THE OIL WELL ISLA TABACO I. THEY CAUSED A LARGE FIRE AND ESCAPED, TAKING AS HOSTAGES BRAZILIAN ENGINEERS PAULO CESAR PAIM DE OLIVEIRA, AUGUSTO CARNEIRO MOREIRA JUNIOR, AND JOSE ROBERTO REIS, IN ADDITION TO A COLOMBIAN CITIZEN WHO WAS ALSO WORKING THERE. BRASPETRO PRESIDENT WAGNER FREIRE TODAY RELEASED AN OFFICIAL NOTE CONFIRMING THE KIDNAPPING. BOTH BRASPETRO AND THE BRAZILIAN EMBASSY IN BOGOTA ARE WORKING TO RESCUE THE BRAZILIAN ENGINEERS. SO FAR THE GUERRILLA GROUP HAS NOT IDENTIFIED ITSELF OR DEMANDED ANY RANSOM FOR THE HOSTAGES.
DEV-MUC3-0184	CLANDESTINE, 22 APR 89 -- WE HAVE NOW UNFOLDED OUR MILITARY MAP, ON WHICH WE HAVE PLACED A SMALL BLACK CIRCLE AT EACH COMBAT SITE, A RED CIRCLE AT THE SITE OF EACH ACT OF SABOTAGE, AND A GREEN CIRCLE FOR EACH AMBUSH OF MILITARY VEHICLES. OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS, THE BLACK CIRCLES ON OUR MAP HAVE BEEN CONCENTRATED IN SAN SALVADOR AND THE EASTERN REGION. UNDOUBTEDLY, THE MOST PROMINENT ACTION HAS BEEN THE ATTACK ON THE NAVY HEADQUARTERS IN SAN SALVADOR'S DENSELY POPULATED SANTA ANITA NEIGHBORHOOD. WE ARE WAITING FOR AN OFFICIAL WAR BULLETIN ON THAT ACTION. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS OF THAT ATTACK IS THAT IT WAS STAGED DESPITE THE ARMY'S PRESENCE IN THE HEART OF THE CAPITAL, AND IT OCCURRED IN FULL DAYLIGHT. AT NOON ON FRIDAY, A CONTINGENT OF URBAN GUERRILLAS GOT WITHIN 50 METERS OF THE NAVY HEADQUARTERS AND LAUNCHED AN ATTACK WITH RIFLES AND ROCKET LAUNCHERS. EVERY SHOT HIT ITS TARGET. ARMED FORCES PATROLS TRIED TO CUT OFF OUR FIGHTERS' RETREAT THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE CAPITAL, BUT THE SOLDIERS WERE UNSUCCESSFUL BECAUSE IN SAN SALVADOR, THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES FORM A MOUNTAIN THAT PROVIDES COVER FOR OUR URBAN GUERRILLAS. EARLY ON SATURDAY MORNING, WE AMBUSHED AN ARMY CONVOY ON THE PAN AMERICAN HIGHWAY AT EL PUNTILLAL, YAPATZTEPEQUE, USING EIGHT EXPLOSIVE CHARGES. THE AMBUSHED TROOPS WERE REINFORCED BY OTHER UNITS, WITH WHOM WE FOUGHT FOR AN HOUR. THIS AMBUSH WAS CARRIED OUT AGAINST ENEMY ARMORED UNITS. THE RESULT OF THIS ACTION WAS AN ESTIMATED 35 CASUALTIES, INCLUDING AN OFFICER OF THE TECHUACAN BATTALION'S RECONDO UNIT AND A CAVALRY OFFICER. FOR OUR PART, WE REPORT THE HEROIC LOSS IN BATTLE OF OUR COMRADE JACKSON. OUR REVOLUTIONARY SALUTE TO THE BRAVE FIGHTERS OF EL PUNTILLAL, WHO INFLICTED THIS LARGE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES ON 5TH INFANTRY BRIGADE TROOPS ON THE PAN AMERICAN HIGHWAY.
DEV-MUC3-0185	PRAGUE , 21 APR 89 -- RECENTLY COMRADE MANUEL CEPEDA, MEMBER OF THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE POLITBURO, VISITED CZECHOSLOVAKIA; WE ASKED HIM FOR AN INTERVIEW. IN THE COURSE OF A FEW DAYS AT THE BEGINNING OF MARCH, THREE LEADING OFFICIALS OF THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY AND THE LEFTIST COALITION, THE PATRIOTIC UNION , COMRADES FORERO, SOTELO, AND ANTEQUERA, WERE MURDERED IN COLOMBIA. WHY? IN COLOMBIA THE DIRTY WAR STEMMING FROM THE AMERICAN TACTICS OF SO-CALLED LOW-INTENSITY CONFLICT IS INTENSIFYING. THE INTERNAL POLITICAL CRISIS IS DEEPENED BY AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE POWERFUL DRUG SMUGGLING CLANS AND THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP WHICH IS CONDUCTING THE DIRTY WAR. IN THE SANTA FE II DOCUMENT, FORMULATING FUTURE UNITED STATES POLICY IN LATIN AMERICA, IT IS EVEN SAID THAT UNLESS THE UNITED STATES INTERVENES IN THE 1990'S COLOMBIA WILL BECOME ANOTHER EL SALVADOR AND ON A MUCH LARGER SCALE. THE SO-CALLED EXTERMINATION OPERATION, ALSO KNOWN AS THE CONDOR PLAN, IS DIRECTED AGAINST THE COMMUNIST PARTY AND UP, AGAINST THE UNIONS, BUT ALSO AGAINST PRIESTS WHO PREACH LIBERATION THEOLOGY, AND RECENTLY THIS HAS INTENSIFIED. IN COLOMBIA SOME ELEMENTS OF FASCISM OPENLY MANIFEST THEMSELVES. THIS IS MANIFESTED IN HUGE AND UNPUNISHED MASSACRES AND IN THE POWERLESSNESS OF PRESIDENT BARCO AND HIS CIVILIAN MINISTERS WHO ARE NOT MANAGING TO KEEP THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP IN CHECK, ALTHOUGH THE PRESIDENT IS THE SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE ARMED FORCES. SOMETIMES PARTISANS ARE ALSO ACCUSED OF TERROR. THAT IS ONE OF THE TRAITS OF AMERICAN POLICY -- TO TERM ANY KIND OF REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE, OF STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY, AND THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT AS TERRORISM. THEREFORE, IT ALSO LABELS THE SANDINISTAS IN NICARAGUA AS TERRORISTS AND THE CONTRA REBELS AS FREEDOM FIGHTERS. BY THIS I DO NOT WANT TO SAY THAT THE PARTISANS DO NOT MAKE MISTAKES, WE ALSO CRITICIZE THEM. FOR EXAMPLE, WE CONDEMNED THE DESTRUCTION OF OIL PIPLINES BY THE COLOMBIAN PARTISAN ORGANIZATION THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY . WE DO NOT AGREE WITH KIDNAPPING CIVILIANS IN EXCHANGE FOR RANSOM. WE ANNOUNCED THAT, AS LONG AS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO END THE CONFLICT, IT IS NECESSARY TO HUMANIZE IT AND TO RESPECT HUMAN LIVES. THESE ARE THE TACTICS OF SOLDIERS -- TO LABEL THE PARTISANS AS TERRORISTS AND THEN MASSACRE THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AS SUSPECTS WHO ARE COLLABORATING WITH TERRORISM. PARTISANS FROM THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA OFFERED THE GOVERNMENT A DIALOGUE ABOUT A TRUCE. HOW DO THEY WANT TO CONDUCT THIS? THE FARC, WHICH IS THE STRONGEST ELEMENT OF THE COLOMBIAN PARTISAN MOVEMENT AND A MEMBER OF ITS COORDINATING COMMITTEE, UNILATERALLY ADOPTED A CEASE-FIRE AND PROPOSED THE CREATION OF A COMMISSION FOR THIS DIALOGUE. IN IT ARE TWO FORMER PRESIDENTS, THE LIBERAL LOPEZ MICHELSEN AND THE CONSERVATIVE PASTRANA, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ASSOCIATION OF INDUSTRIALISTS ECHEVERRI CORREA, AND BOGOTA'S CARDINAL REBOLLO. THE FARC WANTS THE GOVERNMENT TO DISBAND THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS. THE FORMER INTERIOR MINISTER, GAVIRIA, SAID THAT THERE ARE 140 OF THEM. THIS MEANS THAT THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS THEM. THE FARC IS DEMANDING THE PURGE OF PEOPLE FROM THE ARMY COMMAND INVOLVED IN THE DIRTY WAR, THAT THE DEFENSE MINISTER BE A CIVILIAN, THAT THE STATE OF EMERGENCY BE REVOKED, AND THAT THE ROAD TO REAL DEMOCRACY BE OPENED. BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN NEGOTIATING WITH PARTISANS FROM M-19. THE EL TIEMPO NEWSPAPER REPORTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT PROMISED THEM REPRESENTATION IN PARLIAMENT BY THEIR INCLUSION AS CANDIDATES OF THE LIBERAL PARTY. THIS IS TO INVOLVE FOUR SEATS AS LONG AS M-19 LAYS DOWN ITS ARMS AND DISBANDS. THE OTHER PARTISANS BITTERLY CRITICIZED THIS AS A BLOW AGAINST THE UNITY OF THE MOVEMENT WHICH WILL BE ABUSED FOR PROPAGANDA PURPOSES. AT THE SAME TIME, M-19 REPRESENTS ONLY 5 PERCENT OF THE MOVEMENT. IT IS THE INTENTION OF THE GOVERNMENT TO DIVIDE THE PARTISANS. THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS TOOK PLACE IN DECEMBER. HOW DID IT REACT TO THE SITUATION? THE PARTY CALLED FOR PEACE AND OUTLINED THE STRUGGLE FOR A PLURALIST GOVERNMENT OF TRANSITION TOWARDS PEACE AND DEMOCRACY. AT THE END OF FEBRUARY THERE WAS A CENTRAL COMMITTEE SESSION WHICH DISCUSSED THE DIRTY WAR. IT STATED THAT, IN SPITE OF THE TERROR, THERE HAD NOT BEEN WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS IN OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, NAMELY, MASS EMIGRATION. TO ENSURE THAT THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE, THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE DISCUSSED NEW MEASURES, INCLUDING THE TRANSITION OF PART OF THE PARTY TO THE UNDERGROUND. WE WILL NOT ALL TRANSFER, BECAUSE NOW WE MUST STRUGGLE FOR OPEN CONTACT WITH THE MASSES, REGARDLESS OF THE HUGE RISK WHICH IS LINKED TO THIS. WHERE IS THE PARTY SEEKING ALLIES? COMRADE ANTEQUERA, AS DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF THE UP, HAD ESTABLISHED A NUMBER OF CONTACTS. HOWEVER, HE WAS MURDERED, AND SENATOR SAMPER PISANO, A POLITICIAN FROM THE RULING LIBERAL PARTY, WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED DURING THE ASSASSINATION AT BOGOTA AIRPORT ON 3 MARCH. THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT AGAINST THE 32-YEAR-OLD PROSPECTIVE POLITICIAN OCCURRED THE DAY AFTER HE ANNOUNCED HIS CANDIDACY FOR THE PRESIDENCY. HE ANNOUNCED HIS SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRATIC COEXISTENCE, FOR AN END TO THE DIRTY WAR WHICH, AS HE SAID, IS NOT IN THE INTEREST OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE. THEREFORE, HE WAS NOT A CHANCE VICTIM. IT IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT THAT THE CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION COVERING THE AIRPORT, WHICH IS IN THE HANDS OF THE ARMY, WAS SWITCHED OFF. THUS, THEY WANTED TO PREVENT THE MURDERERS BEING FILMED. ONE OF THEM DIED, THEY LET THE OTHER THREE ESCAPE. AT THE SAME TIME, BOGOTA'S CHIEF OF POLICE WAS AT THE AIRPORT ALONG WITH ANOTHER 10 COLONELS AND A NUMBER OF POLICEMEN AND PERSONAL BODYGUARDS. HOW DID THE OTHER PARTIES REACT TO THE ASSASSINATION? A JOINT DOCUMENT WAS SIGNED BY THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY, THE UP, AND THE LIBERAL PARTY, ON WHOSE BEHALF THE FORMER PRESIDENT TURBAY AYALA SIGNED. IT DEMANDS THAT THE GOVERNMENT DISBAND THE PARAMILITARY SQUADS. IT SHOWS THAT OPINIONS ARE BEGINNING TO DIFFER, EVEN IN THE RULING LIBERAL PARTY. THE CONSERVATIVES ARE ALSO EMPHATICALLY CRITICIZING THE BLOODBATH AND THE PASSIVITY OF THE GOVERNMENT, POINTING OUT THAT THEIR LAST PRESIDENT, BETANCUR, CONDUCTED A DIALOGUE WITH THE PARTISANS. THIS IS ALL HAPPENING BEFORE THE ELECTIONS WHICH WILL TAKE PLACE NEXT YEAR. THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY LEADERSHIP MET WITH THE PRESIDENT AFTER THE MURDER OF COMRADE FORERO. WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT? IN THE CONVERSATION, WE POINTED TO THE FACT THAT THE DEFENSE MINISTER, GENERAL GUERRERO PAZ, TRAVELS AROUND COLOMBIA ACCOMPANIED BY THE LEADER OF THE ULTRA-RIGHT WING, RETIRED GENERAL LANDAZABAL REYES, WHO IS LEADER OF THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS. WE ASKED WHY THESE TWO ARE TOGETHER. THE PRESIDENT DID NOT ANSWER US. AT THE MEETING WE ALSO SAID THAT, UNLESS THE DIRTY WAR STOPS, THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY WILL NOT TAKE PART IN THE ELECTIONS. WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE, BECAUSE WE ARE ALL BEING MURDERED. UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT GIVES US A GUARANTEE OF SECURITY, WE WILL NOT SACRIFICE MORE LIVES. THANK YOU FOR THE INTERVIEW.
DEV-MUC3-0186	GUATEMALA CITY, 25 APR 89 -- PERSONS BELIEVED TO BE GUERRILLAS TODAY SHOT INFANTRY COLONEL JOSE LINZANDRO GARCIA ARANDI, DEPUTY COMMANDER OF HUEHUETENANGO MILITARY ZONE IN NORTHWESTERN GUATEMALA. MILITARY SOURCES TOLD ACAN-EFE THE COLONEL WAS DRIVING HIS PRIVATE VEHICLE FROM HUEHUETENANGO TO BARILLAS MUNICIPALITY THIS MORNING WHEN HE WAS INTERCEPTED BY A GROUP OF HEAVILY ARMED, UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS. THE SOURCES ADDED THE OFFICER WAS SHOT SEVERAL TIMES AND THAT HIS BODYGUARDS FOUGHT OFF THE ATTACKERS, WHO FLED INTO THE MOUNTAINS IN THE REGION. IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER THE ALLEGED REBELS SUSTAINED ANY CASUALTIES. THE REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION OF THE PEOPLE IN ARMS, ONE OF THE FOUR GUERRILLA GROUPS THAT COMPOSE THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY, OPERATES IN NORTHWESTERN GUATEMALA.
DEV-MUC3-0187	CLANDESTINE, 25 APR 89 -- THE AMNESTY MENTIONED BY D'AUBUISSON IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE REVIVAL OF SOMETHING THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SOUNDLY DEFEATED. THIS PROPOSAL IS COMPLETELY OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE CURRENT BALANCE OF FORCES AND, AS WE MAY GATHER FROM HIS STATEMENTS, ESSENTIALLY REFLECTS THE PLANS OF THE NEW ARENA GOVERNMENT, WHICH WILL BE IMPOSED ON 1 JUNE, TO INTENSIFY THE WAR. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE READY TO FACE THE WARMONGERING MANEUVERS OF THE TRUE REPRESENTATIVE OF ARENA DEATHS SQUADS WHO IS NOW TRYING TO CREATE A TERRORIST STATE THROUGH NEW REPRESSIVE ACTIONS. HOWEVER, SINCE ARENA WON THE MARCH ELECTION FARCE, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY AWARE OF THE NEED TO CONFRONT SUCH REPRESSIVE ACTIONS. ARENA HAS NOTHING NEW TO OFFER; IT IS OFFERING OLD AND FAILED TACTICS IN THE FACE OF A NEW SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY; THAT IS, A SIGNFICANT CHANGE IN THE BALANCE OF FORCES IN FAVOR OF THE FMLN AND THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE. THIS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY ENCOURAGE A STRUGGLE AS SOON AS THE NEW ARENA GOVERNMENT IS INSTALLED. D'AUBUISSON AND ARENA WILL SCARE NOBODY WITH PLANS THAT ARE COMPLETELY DETACHED FROM A GENUINE WILLINGNESS TO ACHIEVE PEACE. THE FMLN HAS PRESENTED A PRUDENT PEACE PROPOSAL BASED ON AN OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENT BALANCE OF FORCES. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO REALIZE THAT THE DEGREE OF UNITY REACHED TO FACE ARENA'S PLANS WILL BE THE KEY TO COUNTER THE REPRESSION THAT THE ARMED FORCES AND ARENA ARE ALREADY PROMOTING.
DEV-MUC3-0188	QUITO, 25 APR 89 -- THE INSURGENT GROUP ALFARO LIVES, DAMN IT TODAY REAFFIRMED THE SUSPENSION OF ITS ARMED ACTIVITIES AND BLAMED EXTREME RIGHTIST GROUPS FOR SEVERAL ATTACKS AND ASSAULTS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS. AVC SPOKESMAN PATRICIO LEON SAID THE AVC "IS A SERIOUS, RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION. WE HAVE PUT DOWN OUR WEAPONS; WE HAVE SUSPENDED ALL TYPES OF ARMED ACTIVITIES." IN MID-JANUARY, THE AVC SIGNED AN UNCONDITIONAL AGREEMENT WITH PRESIDENT RODRIGO BORJA'S ADMINISTRATION IN WHICH IT PLEDGED TO GIVE UP ITS ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES AND REJOIN THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL LIFE. HOWEVER, NEWS SOURCES BLAMED THE GROUP FOR 13 BANK ROBBERIES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE THE AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED AND FOR A SERIES OF ATTACKS ON A POLICE CHIEF, THE HOME OF AN ARMY GENERAL, AND BODYGUARDS OF DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL JORGE FELIX. LEON SAID THAT THESE ACTIONS WERE INTENDED TO UNDERMINE THE AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT "BECAUSE THE EXTREME RIGHT WING WANTS TO BLAME THE AVC, WHICH IS NOW ENGAGED IN DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES." THE AVC SPOKESMAN EMPHASIZED HIS CONVICTION THAT THERE ARE DEMOCRATIC WAYS OF SOLVING THE NATION'S PROBLEMS. HE DISCLOSED THAT IN THE PAST FEW HOURS, THE AVC FORMED AN ORGANIZATION FOR POLITICAL DIALOGUE "SO THE SOLUTIONS TO THOSE PROBLEMS WILL NOT REMAIN MERE GOOD INTENTIONS." PATRICIO LEON SAID THE AVC'S POLITICAL DIALOGUE ORGANIZATION WILL BEGIN ITS ACTIVITIES BY SEEKING A CONSENSUS ON THE AMOUNT OF AN ANNOUNCED WAGE INCREASE.
DEV-MUC3-0189	SAN SALVADOR, 25 APR 89 -- PRESIDENT DUARTE SAID THIS AFTERNOON THAT PRESIDENT- ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S PEACE PROPOSAL DESERVES RESPECT AND THAT ONE MUST HOPE THAT IT WILL PRODUCE RESULTS THAT WILL BENEFIT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. THE PRESIDENT MADE THIS STATEMENT AT COMALPA AIRPORT UPON HIS RETURN FROM THE UNITED STATES. HE ADDED THAT HE WILL RESUME HIS DUTIES TOMORROW, EVEN THOUGH HIS CANCER HAS GROWN. THERE HAS BEEN VERY NEGATIVE SPECULATION ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH, BUT HE STATED THAT HE WILL RESUME HIS DUTIES IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS. THE TESTS I UNDERWENT INDICATE THAT THE LIVER CANCER HAS GROWN. IT HAS NOT SPREAD BUT IT HAS GROWN, WHICH ADDS TO THE RISK. I UNDERWENT A 5-DAY TREATMENT, AND I WILL HAVE TO RETURN AS SOON AS I PASS THE PRESIDENCY ON TO MY SUCCESSOR. I WILL RETURN TO THE HOSPITAL ON 2 JUNE FOR ANOTHER CHECKUP AND TREATMENT. WHEN WILL YOU RESUME YOUR DUTIES? IMMEDIATELY. I AM THE PRESIDENT AND AS SOON AS I SET FOOT ON SALVADORAN SOIL, I RESUME MY DUTIES. IN REGARD TO THE SEARCHES THAT HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED AT VARIOUS UNION HEADQUARTERS, DUARTE SAID HE WAS NOT FULLY AWARE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THESE WERE CARRIED OUT. HOWEVER, HE SAID THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS MUST BE DEFENDED WHEN DEMOCRATIC FREEDOMS TURN INTO LIBERTINISM. ONE MUST NOT CONFUSE THE FREEDOM OF ALL SALVADORANS TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES, HOLD DEMONSTRATIONS, JOIN UNIONS, AND WORK FOR THEIR ASPIRATIONS WITH TERRORIST AND SUBVERSIVE ACTIONS THAT ATTACK DEMOCRACY. ONE MUST NOT CONFUSE THESE THINGS. THIS IS ONE OF THE BASIC POINTS I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE ALL SECTORS UNDERSTAND. I HAVE BEEN CREATING POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES IN THE COUNTRY SO THAT GRADUALLY WE WILL LEARN TO LIVE FREELY IN A DEMOCRACY WHILE RESPECTING ONE ANOTHER. ASKED ABOUT THE UNITED FRONT THAT ARENA IS PROMOTING IN THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY, THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT IF THIS BENEFITS THE COUNTRY, IT DESERVES SUPPORT. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A POLICY FOR PEACE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE OUTGOING PRESIDENT -- IN OTHER WORDS, BY ME. I HAVE PUBLICLY STATED THIS, AND I HAVE TRIED TO ACHIEVE PEACE THROUGH . IT WILL NOW BE UP TO ANOTHER PRESIDENT. I HAVE TO SHOW RESPECT FOR PRESIDENT-ELECT CRISTIANI, WHO MUST BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO BEGIN HIS TERM IN AN ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH HE CAN PRESENT HIS IDEAS, PROPOSALS, AND SOLUTIONS TO FIND THE PATH TO PEACE. PRESIDENT DUARTE DID NOT COMMENT ON THE PEACE PROPOSAL THAT WAS RECENTLY ANNOUNCED BY ARENA BECAUSE, HE SAID, HE WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT, ADDING THAT IT WOULD BE UNETHICAL TO QUESTION THE PROPOSALS AND EFFORTS OF THE NEXT PRESIDENT. HOWEVER, HE SAID THAT ANY EFFORTS FOR PEACE MUST BE SUPPORTED.
DEV-MUC3-0190	SAN SALVADOR, 26 APR 89 -- PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI YESTERDAY ANNOUNCED CHANGES IN THE ARMY'S STRATEGY TOWARD URBAN TERRORISM AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S DIPLOMATIC OFFENSIVE TO ISOLATE THE NEW GOVERNMENT ABROAD. CRISTIANI SAID: "WE MUST ADJUST OUR POLITICAL-MILITARY STRATEGY AND MODIFY LAWS TO ALLOW US TO PROFESSIONALLY COUNTER THE FMLN'S STRATEGY." DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE YESTERDAY MORNING, THE PRESIDENT-ELECT AND MEMBER OF THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE PRESENTED THE BASIC VIEWPOINTS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION, WHICH WILL REPLACE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT NAPOLEON DUARTE'S ADMINISTRATION ON 1 JUNE. AS THE PRESIDENT-ELECT WAS MAKING THIS STATEMENT, HE LEARNED ABOUT THE ASSASINATION OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO. ALVARADO WAS KILLED BY A BOMB PRESUMABLY PLACED BY AN URBAN GUERRILLA GROUP ON TOP OF HIS ARMORED VEHICLE AS IT STOPPED AT AN INTERSECTION IN SAN MIGUELITO NEIGHBORHOOD, NORTH OF THE CAPITAL. THE FMLN IS ABANDONING "GUERRILLA WARFARE TACTICS IN RURAL AREAS AND INCREASINGLY RESORTING TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CIVILIAN FRONTS IN THE MAIN CITIES AND TO URBAN TERRORISM IN AN ATTEMPT TO DESTABILIZE . AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, THE GUERRILLAS ARE TRYING TO ELICIT NEGATIVE REACTION TOWARD THE NEW GOVERNMENT TO ISOLATE US POLITICALLY FROM THE WORLD," CRISTIANI SAID. VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT FRANCISCO MERINO ACCOMPANIED HIM. HE ADDED: "OBVIOUSLY, IF WARRANTED BY THE SITUATION, WE MUST RESORT TO LEGAL MECHANISMS. SHOULD THE SITUATION BECOME DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL, OUR HARSHER MEASURE WOULD BE TO DECLARE A STATE OF SIEGE." SINCE EARLY APRIL, THE FMLN HAS BEEN CARRYING OUT A STRONG OFFENSIVE AGAINST PRIVATE COMPANIES AND THE BANKING SYSTEM AND HAS STEPPED UP SABOTAGE ACTIONS AGAINST TELEPHONE AND ELECTRICITY NETWORKS. IN ADDITION TO THE ATTACK ON THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, THERE WERE OTHER ATTACKS, IN WHICH GUERRILLA DESERTER MIGUEL CASTELLANOS AND FRANCISCO PECORRINI, BOTH OF WHOM WERE RIGHT-WING IDEOLOGUES, WERE KILLED AND CARLOS MENDOZA, CHIEF EDITOR OF ANALISIS MAGAZINE, WAS WOUNDED. CASTELLANOS AND PECORRINI WERE CONNECTED WITH THAT MAGAZINE.
DEV-MUC3-0191	SAN SALVADOR, 28 APR 89 -- COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, HAS DISCLOSED A REBEL PLAN TO DESTABILIZE THE COUNTRY THROUGH STREET VIOLENCE. COL PONCE SAID MILITARY INTELLIGENCE UNCOVERED THE PLAN, WHICH INVOLVES SEVERAL UNIONS AND MASS ORGANIZATIONS. ACCORDING TO COL PONCE, THERE WILL BE VIOLENT ACTIONS IN THREE DEPARTMENTS: SAN SALVADOR, SANTA ANA, AND SAN MIGUEL. THE UNTS , THE UNIVERSITY OF EL SALVADOR, THE MPTL , AND A SHOCK GROUP, WILL LEAD THE ACTIONS. PONCE SAID HE IS REVEALING THIS TO KEEP THESE ACTIONS FROM TAKING PLACE. HOWEVER, HE SAID, IF THEY ARE CARRIED OUT, THE APPROPRIATE MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN. HE ADDED THE REBELS PLAN TO BURN VEHICLES, DESTROY STORES, BOMB TELEPHONE LINES, AND STEP UP SABOTAGE OF ELECTRICITY LINES. TO ACCOMPANY THESE VIOLENT MASS ACTIVITIES, THEY PLAN TO ATTACK THE MARIONA JAIL. WE KNOW THE UNTS WILL PAY 7 COLONS TO EVERY PARTICIPANT IN A DEMONSTRATION. THEY ARE ALSO SPONSORING A DEMONSTRATION AT A CAMP FOR DISPLACED PERSONS. HONEST PEOPLE CAN REST AT EASE; THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES WILL TAKE THE APPROPRIATE LEGAL MEASURES TO ENSURE THE RIGHTS OF ALL CITIZENS. WE HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TAKING SOME ACTIONS TO COUNTER ANY VIOLENT ACTIONS THEY MAY CARRY OUT ON 1 MAY.
DEV-MUC3-0192	LIMA, 28 APR 89 -- MR PRESIDENT, CAN YOU GIVE US ACCURATE INFORMATION ON THIS CLASH? I CAME HERE WITH THE DEFENSE MINISTER AND WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE JOINT COMMAND TO OBSERVE THE SITE OF A CLASH THAT OCCURRED THIS MORNING, WHEN AN ARMY PATROL COMING FROM JAUJA AND HEADING FOR JULCAN INTERCEPTED TWO VEHICLES CARRYING A LARGE NUMBER OF HEAVILY ARMED SUBVERSIVES. ACCORDING TO THE FIRST REPORTS, BASED ON THE DOCUMENTS SEIZED FROM THE SUBVERSIVES, THEY WERE HEADING FOR CONCEPCION, WHICH THEY WERE PLANNING TO ATTACK. FORTUNATELY, THEY WERE INTERCEPTED BY THE ARMY AT THIS PLACE. WE HAD 6 DEATHS, AMONG THEM A LIEUTENANT, WHILE MORE THAN 60 SUBVERSIVES DIED. A TOTAL OF 47 FAL RIFLES AND SUBMACHINE GUNS WERE RECOVERED. THEY WERE HEAVILY ARMED AND THEY CARRIED KNAPSACKS WITH BOMBS. THEY HAD VEHICLES AN COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT. WE CAME HERE TO SUPPORT THE ACTION BY THE ARMY, BECAUSE THE ARMY NEEDS OUR SUPPORT, AND TO LET THE ENTIRE COUNTRY BECOME AWARE OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION AND OF THE MAGNITUDE AND INTENSITY OF THE STRUGGLE THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE NOW WAGING IN DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY AND OF THE NATION. I BELIEVE THAT THIS DRAMATIC EVENT AND THE LOSS OF OUR SOLDIERS AND OFFICERS SHOULD MAKE THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AWARE OF THE ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY THAT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US SHARE IN THE ANTISUBVERSIVE STRUGGLE. ALL THE FORCES OF THE STATE AND ALL THE ARMS OF THE NATION HAVE BEEN PLACED UNDER THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RESPECTIVE ORGANIZATIONS, OF THE JOINT ARMED FORCES COMMAND, TO FIGHT AND TO ERADICATE THIS TERRIBLE THREAT OF SUBVERSION. SUBVERSIVE VIOLENCE HAS CAUSED DEATH, MATERIAL LOSSES, UNCERTAINTY, FEAR, AND INSECURITY, AND A THREAT TO OUR DEMOCRACY. MR PRESIDENT, IS THERE INFORMATION ON THE GROUP TO WHICH THE SUBVERSIVES BELONG? ACCORDING TO THE FIRST REPORTS, THEY BELONG TO THE SELF- STYLED TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT . MR PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE TWO PASSPORTS IN YOUR HANDS. WHAT DO THEY SAY? WHERE WERE THEY ISSUED AND TO WHOM DID THEY BELONG? IDENTIFICATION PAPERS WERE FOUND ON ALMOST ALL SUBVERSIVES, ALTHOUGH MOST OF THEM ARE FORGED. THESE TWO BOLIVIAN PASSPORTS, HOWEVER, ARE AMONG THE PAPERS THAT SEEM TO BE LEGITIMATE. THESE PASSPORTS MARK THE ARRIVALS AN DEPARTURES OF PERSONS WHO, AS WE CAN SEE, HAVE MISUSED THE RIGHT TO ENTER PERU. IT SEEMS THAT THERE ARE OTHER FOREIGNERS AMONG THE DEAD SUBVERSIVES. ACCORDING TO AN INITIAL EVALUATION, MANY OF THOSE WHO ATTACKED THE TOWN OF JUANJUI 1 1/2 YEARS AGO MIGHT BE AMONG THE DEAD. MR PRESIDENT, WERE THE OWNERS OF THOSE PASSPORTS THE LEADERS OF THE SUBVERSIVE GROUP? NO, WE CANNOT CONFIRM THAT THEY WERE THE LEADERS, BUT THEY WERE THE PERSONS TO WHOM THE PASSPORTS WERE ISSUED. ARE THERE CHIEFS AMONG THE DEAD SUBVERSIVES? ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION GATHERED BY THE OFFICERS, THERE MIGHT BE CHIEFS AMONG THE DEAD. HOW MANY, MR PRESIDENT? JUST A FEW, PERHAPS TWO OR THREE, BECAUSE OF THE ARM BANDS THEY WERE WEARING. THE GENERAL TOLD US THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE HARSHEST BLOWS THAT THE ARMY HAS DEALT TO SUBVERSIVES. IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST BLOWS, AND IT WILL CERTAINLY NOT BE THE LAST ONE. WE HAVE TOTAL CONFIDENCE IN THE ARMED FORCES JOINT COMMAND AND WE FULLY SUPPORT ITS ACTION. IT IS VERY DEPLORABLE, DRAMATIC, AND TRAGIC THAT THIS DRAMATIC EVENT SHOULD CONVEY THE IMAGE OF PERU TO OUR OWN FELLOW COUNTRYMEN AND POSSIBLY TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES. DEMOCRACY, HOWEVER, SHOULD DEFEND ITSELF. IT IS BOTH NECESSARY AND IMPERATIVE THAT WE END THIS TERRIBLE THREAT THROUGH THE MILITARY POWER OF THE NATION AND THROUGH THE ACTION OF THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH WAS ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE. THIS HAS BEEN A HARD BLOW, BUT IT SHOULD BE JUST ONE OF THE HARD BLOWS THAT THE POLICE AND THE ARMED FORCES DEAL UNTIL THIS THREAT IS TOTALLY ELIMINATED. THANK YOU, VERY MUCH.
DEV-MUC3-0193	SAN SALVADOR, 30 APR 89 -- THE SALVADORAN ARMY TODAY LAUNCHED A MILITARY OPERATION IN SAN SALVADOR, WHICH INCLUDED VEHICLE SEARCHES, TO PREVENT A "TERRORIST" PLAN THAT TRADE UNIONS WILL SUPPOSEDLY CARRY OUT TOMORROW FOLLOWING GUERRILLA ORDERS. THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS AND MILITARY POLICE ARE PATROLLING THE CAPITAL BY LAND AND AIR, CONTROLLING THE ENTRANCES TO SAN SALVADOR, AND HAVE INCREASED SEARCHES OF VEHICLES AND BUSES FOR WEAPONS. THIS OPERATION TAKES PLACE ON THE EVE OF A FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT OFFENSIVE SCHEDULED FOR TOMORROW, WHEN LABOR UNIONS HAVE ANNOUNCED THEY WILL HOLD DEMONSTRATIONS IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER CITIES COMMEMORATING INTERNATIONAL LABOR DAY. THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE HAS TELEVISED WARNINGS ACCOMPANIED BY VIDEO CLIPS SHOWING STREET RIOTS, RAIDS ON BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENTS, AND BURNING OF VEHICLES. THE ARMY'S CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE WORKERS' MARCH WAS PRECEDED BY RAIDS OF FOUR UNION HEADQUARTERS IN SAN SALVADOR AND THE ARREST OF SOME 100 MEMBERS OF HUMANITARIAN AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS ON CHARGES OF POSSESSING WEAPONS, EXPLOSIVES, AND "SUBVERSIVE" PROPAGANDA. LEADERS OF THE MAJOR OPPOSITION UNIONS AND LEFTIST POLITICIANS WARNED TODAY THAT THE THREATS AGAINST THE MARCH "REFLECT AN INCREASE OF REPRESSION" BY THE FUTURE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE GOVERNMENT BEFORE ITS 1 JUNE INAUGURATION. IN A COMMUNIQUE, ARENA STATED THAT THE CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE EXPECTED IN MAY "IS BASED ON PLANS BY THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT TO DESTABILIZE AREA GOVERNMENTS." THE GUERRILLAS HAVE WARNED THAT THEY WILL START A MILITARY OFFENSIVE TOMORROW TO PRESSURE THE GOVERNMENT TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE THAT COULD LEAD TO A POLITICAL SOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT. THE MAIN SALVADORAN LABOR UNIONS DENIED THE CHARGES MADE BY THE ARMED FORCES AND HAVE INTENSIFIED THEIR CALLS TO THEIR MEMBERS TO MARCH FOR "PEACE WITH JUSTICE, WORK, AND LIBERTY." A WAR OF WORDS HAS BEEN LAUNCED ON THE MEDIA, WHICH BROADCASTS CALLS FROM THE ARMY ASKING WORKERS NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MARCHES, WHILE UNIONS URGE THEIR MEMBERS TO COMMEMORATE THE CHICAGO INCIDENTS AT THE END OF THE LAST CENTURY. MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ, ARCHBISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, TODAY ASKED THE ARMY TO "ACT CALMLY AND WITHOUT PREJUDICE" AGAINST THE TRADE UNIONS. "WE HOPE AUTHORITIES WILL NOT SILENCE THE WORKERS' LEGITIMATE CLAMOR FOR MORE JUSTICE AND PEACE," ROSA CHAVEZ SAID. THE PRELATE SAID THAT "LABOR AND PEASANT GROUPS WILL MARCH PEACEFULLY," AND THAT THEY ARE NOT LOOKING FOR CONFRONTATION, BUT DEMANDING JUSTICE AND PEACE. ACCORDING TO THE ARMED FORCES, THE GUERRILLAS -- THROUGH "FRONT ORGANIZATIONS" -- WILL CARRY OUT VIOLENT ACTIONS, SUCH AS SABOTAGES ON COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENTS, BANKS, DESTRUCTION OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC VEHICLES IN SAN SALVADOR, SANTA ANA, AND SAN MIGUEL.
DEV-MUC3-0194	BOGOTA, 1 MAY 89 -- GRUPO RADIAL COLOMBIANO NETWORK RADIO STATIONS AND LA REBAJA DRUGSTORES WERE DYNAMITED LAST NIGHT IN BOGOTA, RESULTING IN THE INJURY OF SIX PEOPLE AND MILLIONS IN LOSSES. THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE SHOCK WAVES AFFECTED NEARBY VENDORS AND RESIDENTS. OUR REPORTER HERNANDO MARTINEZ HAS THIS REPORT. IN LAST NIGHT'S ATTACK ON THREE GRUPO RADIAL COLOMBIANO RADIO STATIONS AND TWO LA REBAJA DRUGSTORES, THE ATTACKERS USED BOMBS THAT CREATED LARGE SHOCK WAVES THAT DAMAGED EVERYTHING IN THEIR PATH. SEVERAL HOMES NEAR THE RADIO STATIONS WERE SERIOUSLY DAMAGED. AT THE SAME TIME, BOMBS EXPLODED IN THE SAN VICTORINO NEIGHBORHOOD, DESTROYING 2 LA REBAJA DRUGSTORES, 6 OTHER DRUG STORES, 7 HARDWARE STORES, 30 OFFICES IN NEARBY BUILDINGS, AND 22 VENDOR STANDS. ANOTHER DYNAMITE CHARGE WAS PLACED TODAY AT AN ESTABLISHMENT THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS AS LA REBAJA, BUT WHICH IS NOT CONNECTED TO THE LA REBAJA CHAIN OF DRUGSTORES. THAT BOMB WAS DEFUSED. THE POLICE HAVE STARTED LOOKING FOR THE TERRORISTS.
DEV-MUC3-0195	TEGUCIGALPA, 1 MAY 89 -- HONDURAN WORKERS TODAY DEMANDED THE EXPULSION OF U.S. TROOPS AND NICARAGUAN CONTRAS FROM THE COUNTRY, AND THEY DEMANDED HIGHER WAGES, MEASURES TO CONTROL INFLATION, AND THE CREATION OF NEW JOBS. THE ANTI-AMERICAN FEELING WAS MORE MARKED AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THE LEFTIST UNITED FEDERATION OF HONDURAN WORKERS , WHO BURNED EIGHT U.S. FLAGS. THE DEMONSTRATORS ALSO BURNED A COFFIN SYMBOLIZING THE BURIAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND THE U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT . THEY ALSO BURNED A SCALE MODEL OF THE U.S. PALMEROLA MILITARY BASE IN CENTRAL HONDURAS. THE HONDURAN LABOR ORGANIZATIONS HELD SEPARATE MARCHES. THOSE OF THE RIGHT ENDED THEIR DEMONSTRATION AT THE CENTRAL SQUARE, IN FRONT OF THE STATUE OF CENTRAL AMERICAN HERO FRANCISCO MORAZAN, WHILE THOSE OF THE LEFT ENDED THEIR MARCH IN FRONT OF THE MANUEL BONILLA NATIONAL THEATER. THE CONSERVATIVE CONFEDERATION OF HONDURAN WORKERS AND THE GENERAL WORKERS FEDERATION ALSO CONDEMNED THE PRESENCE OF U.S. TROOPS AND OF MORE THAN 10,000 NICARAGUAN CONTRAS IN THE COUNTRY. "YANKEES GET OUT OF HONDURAS," "CONTRAS GET OUT," "TO PAY THE FOREIGN DEBT IS TO KILL THE PEOPLE," AND "JOBS AND NOT MORE MILITARY AID" WERE SOME OF THE SLOGANS ON PLACARDS AND BANNERS CARRIED BY THE WORKERS. THE SPEAKERS FROM THE MAIN LABOR ORGANIZATIONS DEMANDED THAT PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA'S GOVERNMENT RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, AMEND THE LABOR CODE, REFORM THE SOCIAL SECURITY INSTITUTE, INCREASE THE MINIMUM WAGE, AND RESPECT THE RIGHT TO WORK AND JOB SECURITY. "WE WANT A FREEZE ON PRICES OF STAPLES, HOUSING PROGRAMS, RESPECT FOR NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, DEMOCRATIZATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PARLIAMENT," CTH SECRETARY GENERAL VICTOR ARTILES SAID. THE LABOR ORGANIZATIONS STRESSED THAT THERE CAN BE NO PEACE IN THE COUNTRY WITH MORE THAN 1.2 MILLION UNEMPLOYED AND A POPULATION WITH DEFICIENT HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND FOOD SERVICES. THEY ALSO SAID THEY ARE AGAINST THE SHIPMENT OF WEAPONS TO HONDURAS AND AGAINST THE CREATION OF NEW MILITARY UNITS. FUTH PRESIDENT HECTOR HERNANDEZ SAID THAT HONDURAS "IS NOT ONLY FACING CONSTANT PRESSURE TO DEVALUE ITS CURRENCY BUT ALSO DAILY PRESSURE TO DEVALUE OUR DIGNITY AS A NATION." HERNANDEZ CONDEMNED THE PRESENCE OF U.S. TROOPS AND THE CONTRAS, AND HE SAID THAT "EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO MAKE US PAY FOR A FOREIGN DEBT WE DO NOT OWE." "THAT DEBT WAS PAID A LONG TIME AGO, AND WE MUST ASK WHETHER IT IS THE DEVELOPED CAPITALIST COUNTRIES THAT OWE US BECAUSE OF THEIR LOOTING OF OUR NATURAL RESOURCES," HE ADDED. OSCAR ANIBAL PUERTO, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE HONDURAN HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENSE COMMITTEE , SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES, AND NOT THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT, IS THE ONE THAT ISSUES THE NATIONAL POLICY GUIDELINES. PUERTO CONDEMNED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE THROUGH ILLEGAL ARRESTS AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF MORE THAN 100 PEOPLE.
DEV-MUC3-0196	MOSCOW , 27 APR 89 -- PROGRESSIVE VOICES IN EL SALVADOR ARE A TRUE ALTERNATIVE TO THE RIGHT-WING TERRORIST PATH. HERE IS SHAFIK HANDAL, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF EL SALVADOR: IN EL SALVADOR AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, WORKERS AND PEOPLES PREPARING TO CELEBRATE MAY DAY, INTERNATIONAL WORKERS DAY. IN EL SALVADOR, MAY DAY WILL BE A GREAT JOURNEY OF STRUGGLES AGAINST REPRESSION, WHICH HAS INCREASED AFTER THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE TRIUMPH AT THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS. THE JOURNEY WILL ALSO BE ONE OF RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND BETTER ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS FOR THE WORKING CLASS LIVING IN A SITUATION OF TOTAL POVERTY AND MISERY. IT WILL BE A JOURNEY OF STRUGGLE FOR A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT. IT WILL BE A GREAT EFFORT TO CREATE A GREAT AND BROAD NATIONAL MOVEMENT IN WHICH THE MOST VARIED POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND RELIGIOUS FORCES WOULD CONVERGE TO BEGIN SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS -- BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMY ON ONE SIDE, AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT ON THE OTHER -- TO REACH AGREEMENTS THAT WILL BRING A JUST PEACE AND WILL THUS OPEN UP A STAGE OF ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT, DEMOCRACY, AND SELF-DETERMINATION.
DEV-MUC3-0197	SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 89 -- THE UP TO DATE NEWS TEAM WAS ATTACKED TODAY BY U.S. EMBASSY EMPLOYEES AS THE NEWSMEN WERE COVERING A REPORT ON THE EXPLOSION OF TWO BOMBS IN A BUILDING BELONGING TO THE EMBASSY. THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED AT A U.S. EMBASSY WAREHOUSE LOCATED ON SAN ANTONIO ABAD STREET, NEAR THE CENTRAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL COMPLEX. TONIGHT, AT APPROXIMATELY 1940, A BOMB WENT OFF AT A U.S. EMBASSY WAREHOUSE NEAR THE CENTRAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL COMPLEX ON SAN ANTONIO ABAD STREET IN NORTHWEST SAN SALVADOR. THE UP TO DATE NEWS TEAM, WHICH WAS ON THE SCENE SHORTLY AFTER THE INCIDENT, WAS SHOOTING VIDEO FOOTAGE OF THE EXTENSIVE DAMAGE DONE BY THE BOMBS WHEN U.S. EMBASSY EMPLOYEES ATTACKED THE CAMERAMAN AND HIS ASSISTANT. THE VIDEO EQUIPMENT WAS DAMAGED. HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED: WE DO NOT DESERVE TO BE MISTREATED LIKE THIS. WE ARE NOT MISTREATING YOU. GET OUT. AT THIS POINT, THE CAMERA BELONGING TO THE UP TO DATE NEWS TEAM WAS THROWN ON THE FLOOR. SO FAR, NO GROUP HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK ON THE U.S. EMBASSY WAREHOUSE. SHORTLY AFTER THE EXPLOSION, A SEARCH FOR THE PERPETRATORS OF THE BOMBING WAS BEGUN.
DEV-MUC3-0198	SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 89 -- SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS TODAY DENIED HAVING CARRIED OUT A DYNAMITE ATTACK AGAINST A U.S. EMBASSY WAREHOUSE IN SAN SALVADOR, AN ATTACK OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE BLAMED ON THE GUERRILLAS. THERE WERE NO INJURIES IN TUESDAY NIGHT'S ATTACK. OFFICIAL SOURCES REPORT TODAY THAT URBAN GUERRILLAS THREW TWO EXPLOSIVE DEVICES FROM A VEHICLE AT THE SAN JORGE WAREHOUSE, A U.S. EMBASSY FACILITY IN THE SAN ANTONIO ABAD NEIGHBORHOOD IN NORTHWESTERN SAN SALVADOR. A FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT SPOKESMAN CLAIMED THAT THE ATTACK WAS "A CRUDE MANEUVER BY THE SALVADORAN ARMY AND THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE , WHICH WILL BE GOVERNING EL SALVADOR AS OF 1 JUNE, TO COMPLICATE THE GUERRILLA DELEGATION'S U.S. VISIT." THE REBEL SOURCE CONFIRMED AN FMLN DECISION FIRST ANNOUNCED 3 MONTHS AGO THAT NO U.S. DIPLOMATIC OR ECONOMIC FACILITY IN EL SALVADOR WILL BE CONSIDERED A MILITARY TARGET. AN FMLN DELEGATION WILL MEET TODAY IN NEW YORK WITH UN ASSISTANT SECRETARY ALVARO DE SOTO AND PERMANENT UN REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE FRG, CANADA, AND SPAIN. MEMBERS OF THE POLITICAL DIPLOMATIC GUERRILLA DELEGATION, WHICH OBTAINED UNRESTRICTED VISAS, WILL ASK THE UNITED NATIONS TO PARTICIPATE MORE ACTIVELY IN THE SEARCH FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN ARMED CONFLICT. THE GUERRILLAS WILL ALSO ASK THE UNITED NATIONS TO REMAIN ALERT TO THE SITUATION AND TO EXERT PRESSURE ON THE FUTURE ARENA ADMINISTRATION -- TO BE HEADED BY RIGHTIST ALFREDO CRISTIANI -- TO ENSURE THAT IT RESPECTS HUMAN RIGHTS. LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY PRESIDENT RICARDO ALVARENGA VALDIVIESO, AN ARENA MEMBER, DESCRIBED THE REBEL DELEGATION'S U.S. VISIT AS "DANGEROUS AND RIDICULOUS." "I REALLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THE UNITED STATES COULD GRANT VISAS TO TERRORISTS," ALVARENGA SAID IN REFERENCE TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S DENIAL OF A VISA TO EXTREME RIGHT-WING DEPUTY ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON, WHO HAS BEEN LINKED TO THE DEATH SQUADS. THE DELEGATION, WHOSE U.S. VISIT WILL LAST MORE THAN 8 DAYS, IS HEADED BY SALVADOR SAMAYOA, MIGUEL SAENZ, AND COMMANDER MERCEDES DEL CARMEN LETONA, ALSO KNOWN AS "LUISA." U.S. EMBASSY OFFICIALS HAD DESTROYED THE CAMERAS OF THE LOCAL NEWSCAST "UP TO DATE," WHOSE REPORTERS ATTEMPTED TO PHOTOGRAPH THE SCENE OF THE ATTACK.
DEV-MUC3-0199	LIMA, 7 MAY 89 -- DEPUTY PABLO LI ORMENO, OF THE APRA PARTY, WAS MURDERED THIS AFTERNOON IN AN ATTACK CARRIED OUT BY THREE INDIVIDUALS WHO SHOT HIM IN FRONT OF HIS OWN DRUGSTORE IN THE VILLA EL SALVADOR DISTRICT. THE BODY OF DEPUTY PABLO LI ORMENO IS CURRENTLY AT THE MARIA AUXILIADORA HOSPITAL, IN VILLA MARIA DEL TRIUNFO DISTRICT. HE WAS THE VICTIM OF A TERRORIST ATTACK A WHILE AGO IN VILLA EL SALVADOR. ACCORDING TO INITIAL INVESTIGATIONS, PABLO LI ORMENO WAS AMBUSHED BY TWO TERRORISTS WHO WERE WAITING FOR HIM INSIDE A CAR IN FRONT OF LI'S DRUG STORE, CALLED LA MERCEDITA. SO FAR, TWO DEPUTIES HAVE BEEN MURDERED IN A COWARDLY FASHION BY TERRORISTS IN LESS THAN 15 DAYS.
DEV-MUC3-0200	TEGUCIGALPA, 4 MAY 89 -- ...FOR PEACE. PRESIDENT DUARTE HAS NOT HAD THE LUCK OF STRIKING A RESPONSIVE CHORD IN THE SALVADORAN MARXIST GUERRILLAS. WE HOPE THAT WITH NEW EFFORTS AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF SALVADORAN POLITICAL FORCES WE PEACE. WE ALSO BELIEVE IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT TO BE SEEN IN ITS FULL DIMENSION: IT IS PART OF A REGIONAL PROBLEM, AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE PRESIDENTS HAVE DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT OF THIS INTERNAL CONFLICT AT THEIR MEETINGS. I HAVE A QUESTION ON BILATERAL RELATIONS. WILL YOUR GOVERNMENT RESPECT THE RULING BY THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE AT THE HAGUE REGARDING THE DEMARCATION OF THE BORDER WITH HONDURAS? WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO RESPECT THE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. WE BELIEVE THAT WE MUST BEGIN TO RESOLVE ALL THE DIFFERENCES THAT OUR TWO COUNTRIES MAY HAVE HAD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE MENTIONED TO PRESIDENT AZCONA. CONTRARY TO WHAT SOME PEOPLE MAY HAVE SAID, WE BELIEVE THAT WE MUST SEEK A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND CONTINUE IMPROVING A RELATIONSHIP THAT HAD BEEN SUSPENDED. WE ARE GOING TO RESPECT THE PEACE PROCESS THAT IS ALREADY UNDER WAY BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS THE AGREEMENT TO TAKE THE MATTER TO THE ICJ FOR RESOLUTION. INTERNATIONAL REPORTS STATE THAT VIOLENCE HAS INCREASED IN EL SALVADOR SINCE YOUR PARTY WON THE ELECTIONS. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK IF YOU TRIED TO CONTACT THE GUERRILLAS PRIOR TO THE ELECTIONS OR ARE YOU GOING TO WAIT FOR THE SITUATION TO DETERIORATE EVEN FURTHER? TAKE POWER? THE MARXIST GUERRILLA MOVEMENT IN EL SALVADOR HAS PUBLICLY ADMITTED THAT IT IS INCREASING ITS TERRORIST ACTIONS IN OUR COUNTRY IN AN ATTEMPT TO DESTABILIZE THE NEW GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE NOT GENERATED ANY VIOLENCE; I BELIEVE THE VICTORY OF OUR PARTY IN THE RECENT ELECTIONS DID NOT REPRESENT MORE VIOLENCE. VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT MERINO HEADED THE DELEGATION THAT MET WITH THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS IN MEXICO, AND FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WE HAVE EXPRESSED OUR WILLINGNESS TO SEEK, VIA A DIALOGUE, A SOLUTION TO OUR CONFLICT. NATURALLY, WE CANNOT YET ACT AS A GOVERNMENT, AND WE ARE GOING TO RESPECT THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GUERRILLAS. ONCE OUR ADMINISTRATION IS IN PLACE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THE GREATEST EFFORT TO SEEK A DIALOGUE AND A SOLUTION. ARE YOU PLANNING TO ASK THE UNITED STATES FOR AN INCREASE IN ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID? NO. DURING OUR RECENT TRIP TO WASHINGTON, ALL WE SAID IS THAT WE TRUST THAT THE U. S. GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE ARE IN FAVOR OF THE STRENGTHENING OF DEMOCRACY IN EL SALVADOR. ON THIS OCCASION WE BENEFITTED FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, BUT THIS SHOULD NOT GENERATE, A PRIORI, ANY PREJUDICE AGAINST THE NEW SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT THAT COULD RESULT IN A MODIFICATION OF U.S. AID TO OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE NOT ASKED FOR ANY INCREASE IN AID. WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD DEVELOP OURSELVES AND HAVE EL SALVADOR BECOME SELF-SUPPORTING. WE HOPE THAT WITH THE HELP OF THE LORD WE WILL ACHIEVE THIS NOT BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT TO MAINTAIN OUR FRIENDSHIP, BUT BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT EL SALVADOR CAN BECOME SELF-SUPPORTING. FRANKLY, I WAS SURPRISED BY THIS STATEMENT BY DANIEL ORTEGA. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT HE HAS BASED HIS OPINION ON. I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS IS THE RESULT OF MEETINGS THAT HE MIGHT HAVE HAD WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT WHO HAVE JUST RETURNED FROM NICARAGUA. HOWEVER, AS WE HAVE JUST REITERATED, OUR INTENTION IS TO CONTINUE WITH THE EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN UNDER WAY SINCE ESQUIPULAS II WAS SIGNED, AND TO SEEK DEMOCRACY AND PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA BY MEANS OF A JOINT EFFORT BY OUR COUNTRIES. IT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED THAT THE NEXT SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS WILL BE HELD IN OUR COUNTRY IN JUNE. YOU ARE SLATED TO ATTEND BECAUSE YOU WILL BE INAUGURATED ON 1 JUNE. WHAT POSITION WILL EL SALVADOR TAKE AT THE MEETING, AND TO WHAT EXTENT HAS YOUR GOVERNMENT COMPLIED WITH THE COSTA DEL SOL AGREEMENTS?
DEV-MUC3-0201	LIMA, 8 MAY 89 -- SENATOR LUIS ALBERTO SANCHEZ HAS BEEN DESIGNATED NEW PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS. THIS WAS REPORTED BY PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA ON ARRIVING AT GOVERNMENT PALACE AFTER PAYING HOMAGE IN CONGRESS TO LATE DEPUTY PABLO LI ORMENO. I THINK IT IS A BARBAROUS CRIME WHICH WE MUST REPUDIATE AND AGAINST WHICH WE MUST ALL FIGHT. WE NEED TO PUT ALL POLICE FORCES IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM. WE CAN NO LONGER SCATTER OUR EFFORTS AND KEEP SOME SECTORS IDLE. I HAVE SEEN POLICE AGENTS WORKING AS DRIVERS, SOME OF THEM PLAYING THE ROLE OF GREAT PERSONALITIES, OF CHIEFS. I HAVE SEEN MANY POLICEMEN DOING ADMINISTRATIVE WORK. WE ARE PAYING THOSE PEOPLE AND WE HAVE TRAINED THEM TO FIGHT AGAINST OUR MAIN ENEMY, WHICH IS TERRORISM. I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS, AND WITH HIM ALL MEMBERS OF THE MINISTERIAL CABINET, HAVE PRESENTED THEIR RESIGNATIONS. PRIME MINISTER ARMANDO VILLANUEVA FEELS THAT A POLITICAL RENEWAL IS NECESSARY TO GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO THE DEMOCRATIC SECTORS TO PARTICIPATE MORE ACTIVELY IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST SUBVERSION. THE MURDER OF ANOTHER CONGRESSMAN HAS LED THE MINISTERS TO PRESENT THEIR RESIGNATIONS. THIS POLITICAL RENEWAL MUST LEAD ALL PERUVIANS TO JOIN EFFORTS. WE MUST FORGET OUR ELECTORAL CONFRONTATIONS AND ADVERSITIES FOR A WHILE AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE ELECTIONS. WE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE AT WAR AGAINST TERRORISM, THAT WE ARE AT WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, AND THAT THIS WAR REPRESENTS A COST OF THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF INTIS, DOZENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE MUST MAKE THIS TREMENDOUS EFFORT TO END SUBVERSION ONCE AND FOR ALL.
DEV-MUC3-0202	TEGUCIGALPA, 9 MAY 89 -- WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THERE IS TALK OF A COUP IN GUATEMALA. SO FAR IT IS NOT KNOWN WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS BLOW AGAINST DEMOCRACY IN GUATEMALA. PEOPLE WHO HAVE SPOKEN OVER THE TELEPHONE FROM GUATEMALA CITY WITH VOZ DE HONDURAS HAVE TOLD US THAT THERE ARE REPORTS IN GUATEMALA ABOUT A COUP D'ETAT THAT REPORTEDLY OCCURRED EARLY THIS MORNING. GUATEMALAN AIR FORCE PLANES ARE FLYING OVER THE GUATEMALAN CAPITAL. TO DATE THERE ARE NO EXACT REPORTS ON THE SITUATION. IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT GUATEMALAN AIR FORCE PLANES ARE FLYING OVER VARIOUS PARTS OF GUATEMALA CITY.
DEV-MUC3-0203	SAN SALVADOR, 9 MAY 89 -- OFFICIAL SOURCES REPORTED TODAY THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA GROUPS HAVE INCREASED THEIR SABOTAGE AGAINST THE NATIONAL ELECTRICAL SYSTEM IN THE PAST FEW HOURS, LEAVING 40 PERCENT OF THE NATIONAL TERRITORY WITHOUT ELECTRICITY, WHILE INTERMITTENT BLACKOUTS HAVE OCCURRED IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. THE ENTIRE EASTERN ZONE OF THE COUNTRY WAS WITHOUT ELECTRICITY TODAY, ACCORDING TO A REPORT FROM THE LEMPA RIVER HYDROELECTRIC EXECUTIVE COMMISSION , WHICH STATED THAT ON MONDAY, FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GUERRILLAS BLEW UP SEVERAL STRUCTURES IN THAT REGION. THE REPORT ADDED THAT THE SABOTAGE OCCURRED ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF USULUTAN DEPARTMENT, WHERE OTHER STRUCTURES WERE ALSO BLOWN UP EARLY THIS MORNING. IN THIS CAPITAL, FMLN URBAN COMMANDOES BLEW UP AT LEAST THREE POLES SUPPORTING SECONDARY LINES, AND AN AS YET UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF POLES AND TOWERS IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN THE COUNTRY'S CENTRAL AND WESTERN REGION. IN THE WAKE OF THE NEW ATTACKS AGAINST THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM, ON MONDAY THE CEL STARTED A TURBOGAS PLANT IN THE EASTERN CITY OF SAN MIGUEL TO PARTIALLY SOLVE THE COUNTRY'S ENERGY CRISIS. MEANWHILE, NATIONAL POLICE DIRECTOR COLONEL CARLOS GUZMAN SAID THAT THE FMLN WILL ACCELERATE THE SABOTAGE AS 1 JUNE APPROACHES, WHEN THE RIGHT-WING NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE WILL TAKE POWER. COL GUZMAN ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT MILITARY INTELLIGENCE HAS DISCOVERED "PLANS TO MURDER" ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND MEMBERS AND FUTURE ARENA ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS. GUZMAN ADDED THAT THE PLANS WOULD BE CARRIED OUT BY FMLN URBAN COMMANDOS. "THE DEATH THREATS DO NOT FRIGHTEN US," HE SAID, WITHOUT PROVIDING DETAILS ON THE GUERRILLAS' PLANS TO CARRY OUT THE MURDERS.
DEV-MUC3-0204	SAN SALVADOR, 10 MAY 89 -- CONCERNING A LAST-MINUTE REPORT WHICH INTERNATIONAL NEWS AGENCIES ARE ATTRIBUTING TO A CLANDESTINE RADIO VENCEREMOS ANNOUNCEMENT OF AN OPERATION CONCERNING ATTACKS AGAINST SEVERAL MILITARY GARRISONS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, WE INTERVIEWED COLONEL MAURICIO ERNESTO VARGAS, COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE STATIONED IN SAN MIGUEL. WE CONTACTED HIM BY TELEPHONE, AS FOLLOWS: COLONEL, IS IT TRUE THIS IS PART OF A REGIONAL OR NATIONAL OPERATION TO ATTACK THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE? I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS IS PART OF A REGIONAL OR NATIONAL OPERATION. ALL I KNOW IS THAT THESE ARE TREACHEROUS, COWARDLY ACTIONS, BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF CONFRONTING THE SOLDIERS, THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE MILITARY UNITS. IN SAN MIGUEL, THERE WERE FIVE EXPLOSIONS IN OPEN AREAS ABOUT 2 TO 3 KM APART. THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES OR MATERIAL DAMAGE INFLICTED ON THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE OR ITS INSTALLATIONS. THEY HIT SOME FUEL TANKS FILLED WITH ABOUT 3,000 GALLONS OF GASOLINE, WHICH STARTED A FIRE. HOWEVER, THE FIRES WERE IN OPEN AREAS, SO THERE HAVE BEEN NO CASUALTIES OR MATERIAL DAMAGE TO THE INSTALLATIONS. THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT CLAIMS IT SEIZED EL SALITRE ESTATE AND, FROM THERE, ATTACKED THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE. EL SALITRE ESTATE WAS NOT OCCUPIED. AN OLD SHACK ON THE ESTATE WAS SET ABLAZE, BUT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CONTROLLED THE FIRE. I THINK THESE ARE THE GREAT REVOLUTIONARY VICTORIES THE FMLN TALKS ABOUT: ATTACKS AGAINST FIXED INSTALLATIONS THAT CONTAIN NO MILITARY UNITS, WHERE NOT EVEN PEASANTS ARE SLEEPING AT THE TIME. I BELIEVE THIS IS WHERE THE FMLN SAYS IT FIGHTS HEROICALLY FOR 4 HOURS TO BURN SEVEN PATCHES OF CROPS AND HOW IT CLAIMS IT HEROICALLY FIGHTS TO DOWN POWER TOWERS, WHICH ARE UNMOVING OBJECTS. THESE ARE THE ONLY GREAT ACTIONS IT CARRIES OUT, BUT THESE ACTIONS ARE AGAINST FIXED TARGETS THAT CANNOT MOVE. I REPEAT, THESE ARE COWARDLY ACTIONS THAT DO NOT CONFRONT THE SOLDIERS WHO REPRESENT THE MILITARY ABILITIES OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE COUNTRY. DO YOU HAVE ANY UNITS COMBING THE AREA? YES, DEFINITELY, WE HAVE MEN IN THE AREA. THE TRUTH IS THAT AT 0200 TODAY, UNITS WERE BEING MOBILIZED. AS I SAID, THESE ARE COWARDLY ACTIONS, CARRIED OUT IN THE DARK, AND THE FMLN FLEES WHEN IT SEES OUR WELL-TRAINED MEN IN MILITARY UNIFORM. THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY. YOU HAVE PERMANENT GUARDS FOR SAN MIGUEL. SOME OF THE MARKET VENDORS TOLD US FOR THE FIRST TIME, NOT A SINGLE SHOT WAS HEARD. YES, THAT IS RIGHT. AS I SAID, THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY ATTACKS OR HARASSMENT, JUST FIVE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES, WHICH DOES NOT REPRESENT ANY CHANGES IN THE CORRELATION OF MILITARY FORCES. THE PEOPLE OF SAN MIGUEL SHOULD BE CALM; WE WILL PROVIDE THEM WITH SECURITY. THE PEOPLE OF THE EASTERN AREA OF THE COUNTRY SHOULD BE CALM, BECAUSE WE WILL INCREASE OUR ABILITIES AND EFFORTS TO PROVIDE THEM WITH ALL THE SECURITY POSSIBLE. THE FMLN WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR BEING SO AUDACIOUS. THE FMLN SAID IT WAS FIGHTING IN BERLIN AND ALEGRIA. WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANY ACTION IN BERLIN AND ALEGRIA. WE HAVE REPORTS THAT IN SAN ILDEFONSO, SAN VICENTE DEPARTMENT -- SOUTH OF CABANAS -- THERE WERE PROBLEMS BECAUSE THE NATIONAL GUARD -- WHICH WE SUPPORT THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL TERRITORY -- REPORTED SOME CATAPULTS HAD BEEN FIRED. HOWEVER, NOTHING ELSE HAPPENED, AND I HAVE NO REPORTS OF ANY ACTION IN OTHER PLACES. TODAY IS MOTHER'S DAY. YES, DEFINITELY, GREETINGS TO ALL MOTHERS: HAVE FAITH AND HOPE THAT YOUR SONS ARE HERE -- FROM THE GENERAL TO THE LAST SOLDIER -- AND THEY LOVE YOU VERY MUCH AND ARE WORKING FOR YOU, SO YOU WILL HAVE THE PEACE AND TRANQUILITY YOU NEED AS MOTHERS TO GENERATE LOVE AND COURAGE FOR EACH OF YOUR SONS. ON BEHALF OF ALL YOUR SONS, THE SOLDIERS, TO ALL MOTHERS OF THE EASTERN AREA AND OF EL SALVADOR: RECEIVE LOVE AND KISSES.
DEV-MUC3-0205	SAN SALVADOR, 10 MAY 89 -- REBEL SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA MOVEMENT TODAY INFLICTED ALMOST 100 CASUALTIES ON THE SALVADORAN ARMY DURING ATTACKS ON 15 TOWNS IN 7 DEPARTMENTS. RADIO VENCEREMOS, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S OFFICIAL RADIO STATION, SAID THE REBELS ATTACKED THE GUARDS WHO WATCH OVER THE TOWN OF TEJUTEPEQUE IN THE NORTHEASTERN DEPARTMENT OF CABANAS, INFLICTING 90 CASUALTIES, INCLUDING DEAD OR WOUNDED. THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, WHICH CONFIRMED THE ATTACK, INDICATED THAT THE REBELS SUSTAINED 19 CASUALTIES, INCLUDING DEAD OR WOUNDED, WHILE 3 SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AND 6 WOUNDED IN A 2-HOUR CLASH THAT TOOK PLACE IN TEJUTEPEQUE, 60 KM NORTHWEST OF SAN SALVADOR. ACCORDING TO THE REBELS, AN OFFICER AND A SERGEANT WERE KILLED IN THE TEJUTEPEQUE ATTACK, WHICH BEGAN EARLY IN THE MORNING OF 10 MAY. THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE, COPREFA, PLAYED DOWN THE REBEL ATTACK AND ADMITTED ANOTHER THREE ARMY CASUALTIES AND THE DEATH OF ONE GUERRILLA DURING VARIOUS ATTACKS ON ARMY POSITIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THE FIRST GUERRILLA MILITARY BULLETIN BROADCAST BY THE CLANDESTINE RADIO STATION DID NOT REPORT ANY REBEL CASUALTIES. THE NEW REBEL OFFENSIVE ANNOUNCED IN APRIL IS CALLED: "EVERYBODY AGAINST THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE AND TO STRUGGLE FOR PEACE." WITH THAT OFFENSIVE THE REBELS INTEND TO DESTABILIZE THE NEW GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, WHO IS AN ARENA LEADER. CRISTIANI WILL ASSUME THE PRESIDENCY ON 1 JUNE AND WILL BE REPLACING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE. THE REBEL STATION ADDED THAT ANOTHER THREE CASUALTIES WERE INFLICTED ON TROOPS OF MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 3, WHO WATCH OVER THE TOWN OF ANAMOROS IN THE EASTERN DEPARTMENT OF LA UNION. MILITARY SPOKESMEN ASSERTED THAT ONE GUERRILLA WAS KILLED DURING THE ATTACK ON MILITARY POSITIONS IN CHIRILAGUA, SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT. A FUEL PUMP WAS DESTROYED BY SHRAPNEL FROM EXPLOSIVE DEVICES HURLED BY GUERRILLAS AGAINST A GARRISON OF THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE HEADQUARTERED IN SAN MIGUEL, THE COUNTRY'S THIRD MOST IMPORTANT CITY. COLONEL MAURICIO VARGAS, COMMANDER OF THE 3D BRIGADE, SAID THE REBEL ATTACKS ARE "ACTIONS CARRIED OUT UNDER THE COVER OF DARKNESS AND ARE TREACHEROUS AND COWARDLY ACTS BECAUSE THE REBELS ARE AFRAID TO FACE THE SOLDIERS WHO REPRESENT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY POWER." VARGAS SAID THE REBELS DID NOT INFLICT CASUALTIES ON OR CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE GARRISON. THE GUERRILLAS ALSO ATTACKED THE SOLDIERS GUARDING TWO COFFEE MILLS IN SANTIAGO DE MARIA, USULUTAN DEPARTMENT. THEY DID NOT INFLICT ANY CASUALTIES. RADIO VENCEREMOS REPORTED THAT THE REBELS DESTROYED THE MUNICIPAL OFFICE, A GASOLINE STATION, AND THE CIVIL DEFENSE POST IN EL CONGO, SANTA ANA DEPARTMENT. ACCORDING TO MILITARY SOURCES, THREE MEMBERS OF THE SO-CALLED CIVIL DEFENSE WERE WOUNDED WHEN THEIR POST WAS ATTACKED IN A VILLAGE NEAR METAPAN, SANTA ANA DEPARTMENT. A MILITARY SOURCE ADDED THAT A TELECOMMUNICATIONS OFFICE WAS DESTROYED AND FIVE HOUSES DAMAGED BY EXPLOSIVES IN AGUILARES, IN SAN SALVADOR'S NORTHERN SUBURB. THE REBELS SAID THEY ATTACKED MILITARY POSITIONS IN CHALATENANGO, SAN VICENTE, LA PAZ, AND MORAZAN DEPARTMENTS IN NORTHERN, CENTRAL, AND NORTHWESTERN EL SALVADOR, RESPECTIVELY, WITHOUT INFLICTING ANY CASUALTIES ON GOVERNMENT TROOPS.
DEV-MUC3-0206	HAVANA , 10 MAY 89 -- THE LATEST COUP ATTEMPT AGAINST GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO IS NOT AN ISOLATED EVENT. IT SHOWS THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT'S PRECARIOUSNESS. UNABLE TO MAKE GOOD ITS LUKEWARM ELECTION PROMISES, THIS GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN A COMPLETELY DEFENSIVE POLICY. HARASSED BY ATTEMPTED COUPS, GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION, ADMINISTRATIVE INEPTNESS, AND INSURGENT ACTIVITIES, CEREZO'S ADMINISTRATION IS PLAGUED BY EVIDENT INSTABILITY. HIS GOVERNMENT IS STILL HOSTAGE TO THE MILITARY HIGH COMMAND, WHICH TEMPORARILY SURRENDERED POWER AFTER MANY YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP. NEVERTHELESS, CEREZO IS THE VICTIM OF MILITARY MEN WHO HAVE BEEN KEPT AWAY FROM POSITIONS OF GREATER POWER BY THEIR FELLOW OFFICERS. THIS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF THE MOST RECENT PLOT AGAINST THE CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT. THIS PLOT, MASTERMINDED BY AIR FORCE OFFICERS, WAS CRUSHED BY OFFICERS WHO DECIDED TO SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT FOR THE TIME BEING. GUATEMALA, 85 PERCENT OF WHOSE POPULATION LIVES IN POVERTY, IS PLAGUED BY PARAMILITARY GROUPS THAT SPREAD PANIC, PARTICULARLY AMONG THE PEASANT AND INDIAN POPULATION, IN COLLUSION WITH THE POWERFUL AND WELL-ARMED ARMY. ANOTHER SIGN OF THE GOVERNMENT'S INCREASING WEAKNESS IS THAT IMPORTANT DECISIONS ARE MADE BY THE MILITARY HIGH COMMAND, WHICH DOMINATES KEY ECONOMIC SECTORS. CEREZO'S POWER WAS THREATENED A FEW DAYS AGO BY THE DISCLOSURE THAT GUATEMALAN FORCES FOR A LONG TIME HAD BEEN STAGING JOINT COUNTERINSURGENCY OPERATIONS WITH U.S. SOLDIERS. THIS PARTICIPATION CASTS DOUBTS ON CEREZO'S ALLEGED ACTIVE NEUTRALITY IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND TURNS GUATEMALA INTO JUST ANOTHER SPRINGBOARD FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF U.S. FORCES AS PART OF THE SO-CALLED LOW-INTENSITY WAR. ACCORDING TO THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY, WAR EXERCISES ARE STAGED IN GUATEMALA WITH TROOPS FROM THE U.S. BASES IN THE PANAMA CANAL AREA. ON 31 JANUARY, A U.S. PILOT FLYING A U.S. PLANE WAS KILLED WHEN HE TRIED TO LAND AT THE GUATEMALA CITY AIR FORCE BASE. THE REBELS ASSERTED THE PLANE WAS HIT BY ANTIAIRCRAFT FIRE. IN ADDITION, U.S. TROOPS WERE DEPLOYED IN GUATEMALA'S CHIMALTENANGO DEPARTMENT IN NOVEMBER 1988. SHORTLY AFTER THE MURDER OF 22 PEASANTS LAST FEBRUARY, THE GUERRILLAS NOTICED FLIGHTS NEAR THE SCENE OF THE MASSACRE BY U.S. AIR FORCE CHINOOK HELICOPTERS THAT PARTICIPATED IN COUNTERINSURGENCY OPERATIONS OR IN MISSIONS TO SUPPORT THE GUATEMALAN ARMY. THE MOST RECENT COUP ATTEMPT IN GUATEMALA AND THE DISCOVERY OF AN INCREASING PRESENCE OF U.S. TROOPS IN THAT COUNTRY HAS PLACED CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT IN A SERIOUS, DIFFICULT POSITION. CEREZO SEEMS TO BE FORCED TO OBEY A SOCIETY MADE UP OF PEOPLE MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN HIM.
DEV-MUC3-0207	LIMA, 14 MAY 89 -- THE PERUVIAN POLICE TODAY ARRESTED 10 PEOPLE SUSPECTED OF HAVING DETONATED A CAR BOMB SOME 300 METERS FROM GOVERNMENT HOUSE WHERE PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA AND HIS FAMILY WERE SLEEPING. THE POLICE REPORTED THAT THE POWERFUL SHOCK WAVE DESTROYED WINDOWS AND DOORS IN A 400-METER RADIUS, BUT NO INJURIES WERE REPORTED. THE POLICE ATTRIBUTED THE ATTACK TO THE TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT . THE EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE AT 0150 ON BLOCK NO. 3 ON ANCASH STREET, IN FRONT OF THE SAN FRANCISCO MONASTERY AND THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CULTURE. WITNESSES TOLD POLICE THAT THEY SAW THREE WELL-DRESSED YOUNG MEN ADANDONING THE CAR, APPARENTLY ACTIVATING THE BOMB BY REMOTE CONTROL SOME 100 METERS AWAY. THE SUSPECTS THEN FLED IN ANOTHER CAR THAT WAS AWATING THEM. THIS IS THE SECOND CAR BOMB PLANTED BY THE MRTA SINCE 7 MAY, WHEN THE TERRORIST GROUP BLEW UP ANOTHER VEHICLE IN FRONT OF THE SAN MARTIN MILITARY QUARTERS, AN ARMY ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT LOCATED IN THE LIMA DISCTRICT OF MIRAFLORES. THE MRTA, WHICH HAS DETONATED ABOUT 20 CAR BOMBS, BEGAN ITS ACTIVITIES IN 1984. TWO WEEKS AGO, THE ARMY SHOT 65 MRTA MEMBERS IN A CLASH IN JAUJA, IN THE CENTRAL MOUNTIAN REGION. IN RELATED DEVELOPMENTS, THE DEPARTMENTS OF PASCO, JUNIN, AND HUANUCO RETURNED TO NORMAL TODAY AFTER A 72-HOUR "ARMED STRIKE" CALLED BY THE MAOIST TERRORIST GROUP THE SHINING PATH. TRADE, MINING, AND BANKING ACTIVITIES IN THESE IMPORTANT ANDEAN DEPARTMENTS WERE COMPLETELY PARALYZED DURING THE STRIKE. ONE ARMY OFFICER AND A CIVILIAN DIED, 5 POLICEMEN AND 2 CIVILIZANS WERE INJURED, AND SOME $20 MILLION WAS LOST IN PROPERTY DAMAGE DURING THE STRIKE. THE MAIN PERUVIAN MINES OF LEAD, SILVER, ZINC, GOLD, AND COPPER ARE LOCATED IN THESE THREE DEPARTMENTS. APPROXIMATELY 40,000 MINEWORKERS OBSERVED THE STRIKE OUT OF FEAR OF SHINING PATH RETALIATION.
DEV-MUC3-0208	ASUNCION , 16 MAY 89 -- DOES YOUR PRESENCE HERE SIGNALS THE CREATION OF A KIND OF CONTINENTAL DEMOCRATIC FRONT, SIMILAR TO THE FRONT OF MILITARY GOVERNMENTS OF THE PAST? YES. THE PRESENCE HERE OF THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF THE GROUP OF 8, WITH JUST ONE EXCEPTION, WAS AGREED DURING A PREVIOUS CONVERSATION IN WHICH WE DECIDED THAT PARAGUAY MUST BE GIVEN THE CHANCE THAT IT DESERVES FOLLOWING THE RECENT ELECTIONS THAT REFLECTED THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. AND THIS IS WHAT WE WANT, THE STRENGTHENING OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. WHAT DOES ALL THAT MEAN? IT MEANS THAT THE PARAGUAYAN OPPOSITION WAS ABLE TO PERFORM ITS SUPERVISORY ROLE WITHOUT OBSTACLES, AND THAT THE PROCESS WAS OBSERVED BY INDEPENDENT JOURNALISTS, WHO MADE USE OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION TO GUARANTEE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE PROCESS. YOUR REMARKS ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT, PARTICULARLY NOW THAT THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT IS FIGHTING A GUERRILLA FORCE THAT JEOPARDIZES THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. RIGHT. IN PERU WE ARE FIGHTING FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. IT IS A WELL KNOWN FACT THAT THE WORLD IS RIGHTLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF THOSE WHO ARE ARRESTED DURING AN ANTISUBVERSIVE ACTION. YET THERE IS LITTLE CONCERN ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF THOSE WHO DEFEND DEMOCRACY, WITHIN A DEMOCRACY. DEMOCRACY MUST DEFEND ITSELF. IN THIS CONTEXT THE SUBJECT OF RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT WELL DEFINED. DO YOU MEAN THAT A MILITARY GOVERNMENT IS AT TIMES MORE EFFECTIVE? NO. IT IS MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE FOR REPRESSION, BUT I MADE IT CLEAR THAT SUBVERSION IN A DEMOCRACY IS UNJUSTIFIED AND THAT DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS DO NOT PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. IF THERE ARE ANY HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN A DEMOCRACY, THEY STEM FROM EXCESSES BY THE REPRESSIVE FORCES. WHAT IS THE DIFFRENCE BETWEEN THESE TYPES OF REPRESSION? IT IS SIMPLE. IN A DICTATORSHIP, REPRESSION IS WIDESPREAD AND ALMOST ALWAYS ARBITRARY, AND THERE IS NO ONE TO DEFEND HUMAN RIGHTS. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ALAN GACIA HAS ALREADY SHOWN THAT THERE IS A LIMIT TO WHAT A CHARISMATIC LEADER CAN DO. IN FACT, HE IS YOUNG, HANDSOME, AND HE IS A GOOD SPEAKER. HOWEVER, HE COULD NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEMS. WHAT DOES PERU NEED IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE MUCH DESIRED STABILIZATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS? PERU NEEDS ECONOMIC STABILITY, BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT EXPERIENCE AND WITH A STRONG DESIRE TO DISTRIBUTE WEALTH. THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH WAS DONE DURING THE FIRST 2 AND 1/2 YEARS. THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THIS IS THAT DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION WAS OVERSTIMULATED. EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT SEEM CONTRADICTORY, OUR PRODUCTIVE APPARATUS NEEDED MORE IMPORTED MATERIALS IN ORDER TO INCREASE LOCAL PRODUCTION. THIS LED TO A DANGEROUS DECREASE IN OUR RESERVES. SIMULTANEOUSNLY, THE BANK NATIONALIZATION LAW WAS SET IN MOTION. THIS PROVIDED THE PERFECT FRAMEWORK FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SYSTEM. THERE WAS ALSO THE EARLY START TO THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN, AND FINALLY THE RADICAL OPPOSITION BY THE BUSINESS SECTOR OF A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT. THERE HAS ALSO BEEN A GROWTH IN THE CRIME RATE AND THE COSTLY PROCESS OF FIGHTING THE SHINING PATH GUERRILLAS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND IN URBAN TERRORIST ACTIONS. THIS COULD EASILY LEAD TO THE CONCLUSION THAT PERUVIAN DEMOCRACY DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PROSPECTS, RIGHT? QUITO TO THE CONTRARY. DEMOCRACY WILL BE PRESERVED EVEN IF THE NORMAL HANDING OVER OF POWER TO THE NEW ADMINISTRATION BECOMES THE ONLY OBJECTIVE OF THE RECENTLY INSTALLED CABINET. THIS, HOWEVER, WILL BECOME THE SOLE OBJECTIVE ONLY IN AN ESTREME SITUATION. THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY OTHER OBJECTIVES, BUT I WANT TO STRESS THE SIGNIFICANCE THAT WE ATTACH TO THE HANDING OVER OF POWER TO THE WINNER OF CLEAN ELECTIONS, WITH GUARANTEES FOR ALL OPPOSITION PARTIES. THIS IS HOW THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS WILL BE PRESERVED AND THIS IS HOW THIS GOVERNMENT WILL ATTAIN ONE OF ITS MAIN TARGETS.
DEV-MUC3-0209	GUATEMALA CITY, 16 MAY 89 -- A U.S. HELICOPTER USED TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THE GUATEMALAN ARMY CRASHED THIS EVENING WHEN TRYING TO LAND AT THE MILITARY AIRPORT IN GUATEMALA CITY. ACCORDING TO INITIAL REPORTS, SEVERAL PASSENGERS WERE INJURED, INCLUDING U.S. PERSONNEL, WHO WERE TAKEN TO THE MILITARY HOSPITAL IN GUATEMALA CITY. ACCORDING TO INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE GUATEMALAN ARMY, THE U.S. AIRCRAFT WAS BEING USED TO HELP CARRY FOOD AND SUPPLIES TO TOWNS THAT ARE HARD TO REACH. ACCORDING TO REPORTS SENT BY GUERRILLA GROUPS TO GUATEMALAN NEWSPAPERS -- WHICH HAVE PUBLISHED THESE REPORTS -- THESE FLIGHTS ARE ALL PART OF THE MILITARY SUPPORT IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE SUBVERSIVES. THERE IS NO INFORMATION YET ON THE TYPE OF AIRCRAFT INVOLVED IN THE ACCIDENT, WHICH RESULTED WHEN "IT LOST POWER" BEFORE LANDING, ACCORDING TO INITIAL REPORTS. U.S. ARMY "CHINOOK" HELICOPTERS ARE USED IN GUATEMALA FOR VARIOUS OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT BETWEEN GUATEMALA CITY AND AREAS FAR DISTANT FROM THE CAPITAL. THIS IS THE FOURTH AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT OCCURRING IN RECENT MONTHS. A GUATEMALAN AIR FORCE "PILATUS" AIRPLANE CRASHED SOME MONTHS AGO IN CHIMALTENANGO PROVINCE, AND ITS PILOT DIED IN THE ACCIDENT. A FAG HELICOPTER RECENTLY PLUNGED INTO THE PETEN ITZA LAKE, LOCATED IN NORTHERN GUATEMALA; TWO CREWMEN DIED AND TWO SURVIVED THE ACCIDENT. THE ARMY'S OFFICIAL VERSION REPORTED THAT THESE ACCIDENTS WERE CAUSED BY BAD WEATHER OR MECHANICAL FAILURE. GUERRILLA REPORTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN LOCAL NEWSPAPERS, SAY THAT THE AIRCRAFT WERE SHOT DOWN BY THEIR ANTIAIRCRAFT UNITS.
DEV-MUC3-0210	SAN SALVADOR, 16 MAY 89 -- GUERRILLA URBAN COMMANDO UNITS ATTACKED THE HOME OF NATIONAL ASSEMBLY PRESIDENT RICARDO ALVARENGA VALDIVIESO TODAY AT NOON, KILLING A NATIONAL POLICE OFFICER GUARDING THE HOUSE. THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE AT APPROXIMATELY 1330 AND WAS ALLEGEDLY PERPETRATED BY GUERRILLA URBAN COMMANDO UNITS. DURING THE ATTACK, NATIONAL POLICE OFFICER FIDEL SANCHEZ SANCHEZ WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED. HE WAS TAKEN TO A MILITARY HOSPITAL BY MEMBERS OF ALVARENGA'S SECURITY POLICE. ALVARENGA WAS HAVING LUNCH IN HIS HOME WHEN THE POLICE OFFICERS GUARDING HIS HOME WERE ATTACKED. WITNESSES HAVE REPORTED THAT FOUR YOUTHS IN A RED PICKUP TRUCK SHOT AT THE POLICEMEN FROM A DISTANCE OF 20 METERS. THIS LED TO AN EXCHANGE OF GUNFIRE, ALARMING RESIDENTS IN THE COLONIA MIRAMONTES AREA. ALVARENGA ACCUSED THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT OF BEING DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACK. HE ATTRIBUTED THE ATTACK TO THE FACT THAT HE IS OPPOSED TO ALLOWING 100 HANDICAPPED GUERRILLAS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY. ALVARENGA ADDED THAT THE INSURGENTS' ATTITUDE HAS DEFINITELY CLOSED THE DOOR ON THE POSSIBILITY OF CARRYING OUT THIS EVACUATION. IT CANNOT BE. TODAY, MORE THAN EVER, I INSIST THAT THESE HANDICAPPED GUERRILLAS SHOULD NOT LEAVE THE COUNTRY. IF THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT, ALL OF THEM, AND THE JUSTICE MINISTER ALLOW THESE HANDICAPPED GUERRILLAS TO LEAVE, THEN WE WILL KEEP FIGHTING AGAINST THAT TYPE OF ACTION. WHY NOT TAKE THE CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN MAIMED OUT OF THE COUNTRY? SO MANY CHILDREN HAVE BEEN MAIMED BY BOMBS! I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AT LEAST ONE SALVADORAN CHILD BE TAKEN TO A LARGE HOSPITAL IN GERMANY. IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO GO TO SUCH EXTREMES. AM I MAKING MYSELF CLEAR? TELL ME, HOW CAN WE SPEAK OF HUMANITARIAN ACTS WHEN OUR SALVADORAN CHILDREN, OUR YOUTH ARE BEING MAIMED? I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL PREVENT GUERRILLA COERCIVE ACTIONS. THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY CANNOT PREVENT THIS. WHAT WE CAN DO IS LEGISLATE. WE NEED TO LEGISLATE A BIT MORE TO GIVE OUR PEOPLE SECURITY. IF THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR THE FMLN AND, FOR THIS REASON, IT HAS ELEMENTS IT WISHES TO DESTROY... LOOK, THEY CAN DESTROY ME. THIS IS TRUE. I DO NOT WANT IT TO HAPPEN, BUT THEY CAN DESTROY ME. BUT OTHERS LIKE RICARDO ALVARENGA WILL COME FORWARD. THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE ON BERNAL AVENUE IN COLONIA MIRAMONTES, A FEW MINUTES AFTER ALVARENGA ENTERED HIS HOME. ALVARENGA SUFFERED NO INJURIES. THE FMLN HAS NOT YET CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK.
DEV-MUC3-0211	CLANDESTINE, 24 MAY 89 -- THE GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT STATES: 1. BY REJECTING OUR PROPOSAL AIMED AT TRANSFORMING THE ELECTIONS INTO A PATH TO ACHIEVE PEACE, THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE TURNED THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS INTO A PROCESS OF WAR. 2. ARENA WILL ESTABLISH A GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED ONLY BY THE VOTES OF A MERE 18 PERCENT OF VOTING-AGE SALVADORANS, WHICH MAKES IT AN ILLEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT AND A GOVERNMENT OF MINORITIES FOR MINORITIES. 3. EVER SINCE ELECTION RESULTS WERE REVEALED, THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF REPRESSION AGAINST THE PEOPLE IN THE FORM OF ARRESTS, MURDERS, SEARCHES, RAIDS ON LABOR AND ASSOCIATION OFFICES, ATTACKS AGAINST UNIVERSITIES, AND SO ON. 4. ARENA IS ALREADY ANNOUNCING, AND IN MANY CASES ALREADY IMPLEMENTING, ANTIPOPULAR MEASURES SUCH AS THE FORMATION OF DEATH SQUADS UNDER THE NAME OF PATRIOTIC CIVILIAN DEFENSE, THE ANNULMENT OF DECREE 207, DEVALUATION OF THE CURRENCY, PRIVATIZATIONS, ESTABLISHMENT OF A STATE OF SIEGE, AND OTHER MEASURES THAT WILL HURT THE PEOPLE. 5. ARENA'S POLICY TOWARD THE EVACUATION OF PEOPLE MAIMED IN WAR SHOWS THAT THE ARENA GOVERNMENT WILL FURTHER DEHUMANIZE THE WAR. 6. AS A FIRST REPLY OF OUR FRONT TO THE ARENA GOVERNMENT, THE GENERAL COMMAND DECREES A NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE BEGINNING AT DAWN ON 31 MAY. THE MEASURE MUST BE COMPLIED WITH ON ALL HIGHWAYS OF THE COUNTRY AND IN THE CITIES. WE URGE ALL OUR UNITS TO ENFORCE THIS DECREE AND OUR PEOPLE TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THE STOPPAGE TO REPUDIATE THE DEATH SQUAD'S GOVERNMENT AT THE VERY MOMENT OF ITS INAUGURATION. FMLN GENERAL COMMAND COMMANDERS FRANCISCO JOVEL, EDUARDO SANCHO, SHAFIK JORGE HANDAL, LEONEL GONZALEZ, AND JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS.
DEV-MUC3-0212	CLANDESTINE, 24 MAY 89 -- OUR ARMY IS ESSENTIALLY THE PEOPLE'S ARMY, BECAUSE IT WAS BORN OF THE PEOPLE. THROUGHOUT THESE MANY YEARS OF WAR, HUNDREDS OF COUNTRYMEN HAVE SPILLED THEIR BLOOD FOR THE LAND ON WHICH THEY TOIL TO ACHIEVE JUSTICE, DEMOCRACY, AND BETTER LIVING CONDITIONS FOR THE PEOPLE. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE'S MOST HEARTFELT DESIRES. IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE ENEMY, WE HAVE COMMITTED ERRORS IN MILITARY PROCEDURES THAT HAVE RESULTED IN CASUALTIES AMONG THE PEOPLE. TO QUICKLY AND RADICALLY CORRECT THESE REGRETTABLE PROCEDURAL ERRORS, THE FARBUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND ORDERS ALL COMMANDERS AND COMBATANTS OF OUR MILITARY UNITS TO STUDY AND IMPLEMENT THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS, WHICH MUST BE STRICTLY FULFILLED: 1. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE MUST POPULATED AREAS BE MINED. MINES MUST BE PLACED WHERE ENEMY TROOPS TRAVEL. ALL PRECAUTIONS MUST BE TAKEN IN HIGHWAY AMBUSHES SO THE MINES WILL ONLY AFFECT ENEMY PATROLS AND TRANSPORT VEHICLES. 2. IN THE PLANS TO ATTACK ENEMY GARRISONS, THE COMMANDERS MUST ALWAYS EVALUATE THE CIVILIAN POPULATION'S SITUATION. EVERY EFFORT MUST BE MADE TO CARRY OUT CLEAN ATTACKS. IF THERE IS ANY POSSIBILITY, EVEN AFTER ALL ALTERNATIVES HAVE BEEN EXPLORED, THAT PERSONS HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ENEMY WOULD BE AFFECTED IF THE ATTACK IS CARRIED OUT, THE OPERATION MUST BE SUSPENDED. 3. BEFORE PUNISHING THE OWNERS OF PRIVATE VEHICLES AND BUSES WHO VIOLATE THE PROVISIONS OF THE TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE, OUR UNITS MUST BE ABSOLUTELY SURE THE OWNER VIOLATED THE PROVISION. 4. IN CARRYING OUT SABOTAGE OPERATIONS, IT MUST BE CONSIDERED WHO WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THE ACTION. TO THE SAME EXTENT OUR SABOTAGE OPERATIONS MUST BE IMPLACABLE WITH THE REGIME AND THE OLIGARCHY, THOSE OPERATIONS MUST NOT AFFECT WORKERS, SMALL OWNERS, PEASANTS, OR THE LOWER CLASSES. 5. BEFORE CARRYING OUT EXECUTIONS, AN EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATION MUST BE CONDUCTED UNTIL IT IS CONFIRMED THAT THE TARGET OF THE OPERATION IS AN ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. 6. ALL OUR MILITARY OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE EXECUTIONS, MUST BE PUBLICLY RECOGNIZED SO AS TO AVOID CONFUSION WITH THE ENEMY'S DIRTY WAR PROCEDURES. EVERY FMLN COMBATANT MUST BEAR IN MIND THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE PEOPLE AND THAT OUR STRUGGLE IS OF THE PEOPLE AND FOR THE PEOPLE. THEREFORE, WE MUST ACT CONSISTENT WITH THIS REVOLUTIONARY PRINCIPLE. FMLN GENERAL COMMAND, MAY 1989
DEV-MUC3-0213	LA PAZ, 26 MAY 89 -- INTERIOR MINISTER EDUARDO PEREZ BELTRAN HAS DISCARDED THE POSSIBILITY OF A NEW, QUOTE, TERRORIST OR GUERRILLA GROUP, UNQUOTE, OUTBREAK IN THE COUNTRY. HE MADE THIS STATEMENT REFERRING TO THE MURDER OF TWO U.S. MISSIONARIES LAST WEDNESDAY NIGHT. TO REMIND THE PEOPLE OF THIS CASE, DURING THE EVENING OF 24 MAY TWO U.S. CITIZENS, WHO BELONGED TO A RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION, WERE MURDERED BY A SELF-STYLED ZARATE WILKA ARMED FORCES OF LIBERATION GROUP IN DOWNTOWN LA PAZ. THE INTERIOR MINISTER ADDED THAT THIS ALLEGED ORGANIZATION THAT CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MURDER, HAS NO TIES WITH THE PERUVIAN SHINING PATH TERRORIST GROUP. TO THIS MOMENT, AND DUE TO THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE CASE, I DO NOT DARE TO ADMIT THE EXISTANCE OF ANY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO TERRORIST GROUPS. IF THE SHINING PATH IS OPERATING IN BOLIVIA, IT SHOULD ANNOUNCE THAT IT IS IN FACT SHINING PATH THAT IS COMMITTING THESE CRIMES. WE CAN SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY IN THE 1960'S, WHEN IT DID NOT HIDE ITS IDENTITY. THIS WAS AN INTERNATIONAL GROUP. THEY ARRIVED IN BOLIVIA WITHOUT HIDING THEIR INTERNATIONAL IDENTITY, AND THERE ARE MANY BOLIVIANS WHO CAN TELL US ABOUT THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY. NOW, IF THIS CRIME WAS COMMITTED BY THE SHINING PATH, THEN IT WAS COMMITTED BY THE SHINING PATH AND NOT BY THE ZARATE WILKA GROUP. I DO NOT WANT TO DISCARD THIS POSSIBILITY, HOWEVER, I DO NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT AS SOMETHING VERIFIED AND CONFIRMED. OUR OBLIGATION, AS MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, IS TO RELEASE THE RESULTS OF SOMETHING OBVIOUS, FULLY VERIFIED AND CONFIRMED. THE INTERIOR MINISTER ADDED THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE SELF-STYLED FAL-ZARATE WILKA GROUP AND OF SHINING PATH MEMBERS IN BOLIVIA IS DOUBTFUL, BECAUSE IN THE CRIMINAL CASES RECORDED IN COCHABAMBA AND IN ORURO RECENTLY, THE POLICE DISCOVERED THAT COMMON CRIMINALS, AND ESPECIALLY THOSE LINKED TO THE WORLD OF DRUG ADDITION AND DRUG TRAFFICKING WERE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THOSE CRIMES. REGARDING THE MURDER OF THE TWO MISSIONARIES IN LA PAZ LAST WEDNESDAY, THE INTERIOR MINISTER STATED THAT NO ONE HAS BEEN DETAINED, BUT THAT THE INVESTIGATIONS BY THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES CONTINUE. NO. WE CANNOT SUPPOSE THE EXISTENCE OF A TERRORIST GROUP IN BOLIVIA. AND WHAT ABOUT THESE MURDER CASES? I DO NOT KNOW. MANY PEOPLE CAN BE HIDING BEHIND THIS ZARATE WILKA GROUP. WE DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS ZARATE WILKA GROUP. WE DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEIR POLITICAL LEANINGS, OR WHAT PARTY IS BEHIND THIS GROUP. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A COMMON CRIME, OR MAYBE NOT. BUT WE CANNOT JUST GO OUT AND SAY: YES, THIS GROUP LAST NIGHT MACHINEGUNNED THESE PEOPLE, THAT THEY ESCAPED, ETC. THIS WOULD MEAN A VERY IRRESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR. THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WANTS TO DEAL WITH THIS CASE AS SERIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE AND NOT CAUSE THE PEOPLE TO PANIC. WE MUST DO SOMETHING FOR THE COUNTRY. WE SHOULD UNITE OUR FORCES, ALL COALITION PARTIES, THE RULING PARTY, THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, THE ARMED FORCES, THE NATIONAL POLICE, AND ALL BOLIVIANS, TO DEFEND OUR DEMOCRACY. THIS WOULD REPRESENT A REAL BOLIVIAN STRUGGLE AGAINST THOSE WHO INTEND TO DISRUPT OUR PROCESS OF LIBERTY, TO FIGHT FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR CHILDREN AND OF THE FATHERLAND.
DEV-MUC3-0214	LA PAZ, 26 MAY 89 -- THE MURDER BY MACHINEGUN FIRE OF TWO U.S. MISSIONARIES TODAY PROMPTED AN EMERGENCY MEETING OF THE BOLIVIAN POLICE HIGH COMMAND. THE U.S. EMBASSY IN LA PAZ WILL COOPERATE IN THE INVESTIGATIONS OF THE MURDER BECAUSE THEY CONSIDERED AN ANTI-U.S. ACTION. ACCORDING TO SOME POLITICAL REACTIONS, THIS CRIMES COMMITTED BY THE SELF-STYLED ZARATE-WILKA GROUP, SHOWS THAT THERE ARE ARMED GROUPS OPERATING IN BOLIVIA. LESS THAN 40 HOURS AFTER THE MURDER OF THE TWO MORMON MISSIONARIES BY AN IRREGULAR ARMED GROUP IN LA PAZ, THE POLICE HIGH COMMAND HAS DECLARED AN EMERGENCY STATE ALL CADRES IN AN EFFORT TO CAPTURE THE PERPETRATORS OF THIS CRIME. THE BOLIVIAN POLICE HIGH COMMAND THIS MORNING CALLED AN EMERGENCY MEETING TO BEGIN THE OFFICIAL INVESTIGATIONS. AFTER BRIEFING THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC, INTERIOR MINISTER EDUARDO PEREZ BELTRAN ALSO WENT TO THE POLICE HEADQUARTERS TO SEEK FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE MURDER CASE. THE INTERIOR MINISTER PROMISED TO RELEASE THE FIRST RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS AT 1700 THIS AFTERNOON. TODD RAY WILSON, 20 YEARS OLD, AND JEFFREY BRENT BALL, 21, WERE MURDERED BY MACHINEGUN BURSTS WHEN THEY WERE WALKING HOME ON ANCASH STREET ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THE ZARATE WILKA GROUP HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MURDER OF THESE TWO MISSIONARIES. THIS GROUP REPORTEDLY COMMITTED THIS CRIME TO PROTEST U.S. MEDDLING IN BOLIVIA.
DEV-MUC3-0215	TEGUCIGALPA, 29 MAY 89 -- THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES TODAY CONFIRMED THAT HEAVY CLASHES TOOK PLACE BETWEEN HONDURAN AND SALVADORAN TROOPS OVER THE WEEKEND. ACCORDING TO A LOCAL RADIO STATION, BOTH HONDURAN AND SALVADORAN CIVILIANS AND SOLDIERS WERE KILLED. JUAN SIERRA, A HONDURAN ARMED FORCES SOURCE, TOLD REUTER: "WE ARE CERTAIN THERE WERE CLASHES, BUT THE DETAILS WILL BE AVAILABLE LATER." THE HONDURAN RADIO STATION RADIO AMERICA, QUOTING A FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT SOURCE, SAID AN UNSPECIFIED NUMBER OF CIVILIANS AND SOLDIERS WERE KILLED WHEN SALVADORAN TROOPS ENTERED HONDURAN TERRITORY ON SATURDAY. THE FMLN, QUOTED BY RADIO AMERICA, SAID THE FIGHTING IN THE HONDURAN DEPARTMENT OF INTIBUCA, ON THE PLAINS NEAR THE SALVADORAN BORDER, LASTED 4 HOURS. DURING THE FIGHTING, A SALVADORAN HELICOPTER BOMBED HONDURAN CIVILIANS, KILLING OR WOUNDING A NUMBER OF THEM, THE FMLN SAID. RADIO AMERICA SAID: "WE DO NOT KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER OF DEAD AND WOUNDED. ONLY SAID IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT CIVILIANS WERE KILLED OR WOUNDED IN THE CLASH." THE TROOPS OF BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE PREVIOUSLY CLASHED AT THE BORDER AS THE RESULT OF TENSION CAUSED BY TERRITORIAL DISPUTES AND ALSO BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF LARGE CONTINGENTS OF SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS NEAR THE BORDER. THE TWO ARMIES HAVE PREVIOUSLY HELD JOINT ANTIGUERRILLA OPERATIONS. ON ONE OCCASION, SALVADORAN SOLDIERS ATTACKED HONDURAN TROOPS, MISTAKING THEM FOR REBELS. THE TENSION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES REACHED ITS PEAK DURING THE SO-CALLED SOCCER WAR IN 1969, WHEN THE TWO COUNTRIES FOUGHT FOR 100 HOURS OVER A TERRITORIAL DISPUTE.
DEV-MUC3-0216	SAN SALVADOR, 29 MAY 89 -- THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND TODAY PRESENTED A NEW PROPOSAL FOR A DIALOGUE TO THE GOVERNMENT THAT WILL BE HEADED BY PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI. IN THEIR DOCUMENT, THE GUERRILLAS PROMISE TO REFRAIN FROM ATTACKS OF ANY KIND AGAINST LEADERS OF THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, TO END NATIONWIDE TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGES, AND, BY EXTENSION, TO SUSPEND ATTACKS AGAINST PUBLIC VEHICLES. THE GUERRILLAS ALSO PLEDGE TO RESUME THE DIALOGUE WITH THE POLITICAL PARTIES THAT BEGAN IN COATEPEC, MEXICO, IN MARCH. THE GUERRILLAS ALSO PROPOSE TO THE ARENA ADMINISTRATION THAT FORMER MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON AND ALL OTHERS IMPLICATED IN THE MURDER OF MSGR ROMERO BE PUT ON TRIAL. THE REBELS ALSO DEMAND THAT D'AUBUISSON BE EXCLUDED FROM ALL BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. ANOTHER POINT IN THE DOCUMENT CALLS FOR THE CONTINUATION OF AGRARIAN REFORM, INCLUDING DECREE 207, AND FOR THE NATIONALIZATION OF BANKS AND FOREIGN TRADE, AS WAS DECREED BY THE GOVERNMENT JUNTA IN 1980.
DEV-MUC3-0217	CLANDESTINE, 28 MAY 89 -- AT 1400 ON 27 MAY, SPECIAL HONDURAN TROOPS ENTERED SAN ANDRES AND TIERRA AGRIA, SAN GERARDO JURISDICTION, SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT, WHEN ARCE BATTALION TROOPS WERE CARRYING OUT AN OPERATION IN THE AREA. THEY CLASHED NEAR EL CHENGUE HILL AND ALONG THE SHORES OF TOROLA RIVER. DURING THIS CLASH, WHICH LASTED 4 HOURS, ARCE BATTALION WAS SUPPORTED BY TWO ROCKET-FIRING HELICOPTERS, A HUGHES 500, AND A A-37 PLANE. SALVADORAN TROOPS SUSTAINED NUMEROUS CASUALTIES, INCLUDING A WOUNDED ARCE BATTALION OFFICER. HONDURAN TROOPS WERE PUSHED BACK AND CORNERED IN LOS LLANITOS, SANTA LUCIA JURISDICTION, INTIBUCA DEPARTMENT, HONDURAS. ARCE BATTALION LANDED TROOPS FROM FOUR HELICOPTERS IN THAT VILLAGE. AN HONDURAN HELICOPTER, WHICH WAS EVACUATING CASUALTIES, WAS ATTACKED AND PURSUED 7 KM INTO HONDURAN TERRITORY BY A SALVADORAN HELICOPTER, WHICH FIRED ROCKETS AND MACHINEGUNS. ARCE BATTALION, WHICH SURROUNDED HONDURAN TROOPS IN LOS LLANITOS, CAPTURED AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF PRISONERS. IN THIS CLASH, RESIDENTS OF THE SAN ANDRES, CANTONS, AND RESIDENTS OF LOS CASTANOS, LOS LLANITOS, AND LA CEIBITA WERE ROCKETED AND MACHINEGUNNED BY SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS. THERE ARE REPORTS ABOUT PARTIALLY DESTROYED HOMES AND ANIMALS THAT WERE KILLED. WE ARE TRYING TO INVESTIGATE THE NAMES OF THE WOUNDED AND DEAD AMONG AREA RESIDENTS. WE URGE THE HONDURAN PEOPLE TO REFLECT ON THE SERIOUSNESS AND REPERCUSSIONS OF THESE CLASHES. THIS IS THE RESULT OF THE HONDURAN ARMY'S POLICY OF INVOLVMENT IN THE SALVADORAN WAR. THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT HAD WARNED THAT HONDURAN TROOPS' COOPERATION AND INVOLVEMENT IN THE SALVADORAN WAR, FOLLOWING A U.S. DECISION, WOULD EVENTUALLY LEAD TO A CLASH BETWEEN THE TWO ARMIES. IT IS A SECRET TO NOBODY THAT THE OLIGARCHS WHO HAVE REACHED POWER WITH THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE GOVERNMENT ARE THE SAME ONES WHO PROMOTED THE INVASION OF HONDURAS IN 1969 AND THAT THE OFFICERS WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE AT THE TIME FOR MASSACRES, RAIDS, AND ABUSES AGAINST THE HONDURAN PEOPLE ARE THE SAME ONES WHO ARE IN THE HIERARCHY OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY. WE BELIEVE HONDURANS MUST THINK ABOUT THIS SITUATION, BECAUSE THIS LEVEL OF CONFRONTATION WITH INFANTRY TROOPS AND AIRCRAFT WILL SET THE TONE OF THE CONFLICT FOR THE DEFINITION OF THE BORDER CONFLICT OF A GOVERNMENT OF OLIGARCHS WHO HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED AN EXPANSIONIST POLICY TOWARD HONDURAS. ONCE AGAIN, WE CALL ON THE HONDURAN PEOPLE TO STOP THEIR ARMY'S INVOLVEMENT IN SOMEONE ELSE'S WAR IN EL SALVADOR, ITS MAIN ENEMY. WE CALL ON THE NATIONAL AND INTERNAL PRESS, ESPECIALLY HONDURAN MEDIA, TO VISIT LOS LLANITOS, SANTA LUCIA, INTIBUCA DEPARTMENT, TO CONFIRM THESE SERIOUS INCIDENTS. WE CALL ON HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS TO HELP THE INJURED CIVILIANS. EL SALVADOR, 28 MAY 1989
DEV-MUC3-0218	ROSARIO, 29 MAY 89 -- IT HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY REPORTED THAT MORE THAN 500 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ARRESTED FOLLOWING VIOLENT INCIDENTS THAT OCCURRED HERE TODAY. THE ARRESTED ARE BEING HELD IN POLICE QUARTERS. THIRTY-SIX PEOPLE, 11 OF WHOM HAVE BULLET WOUNDS, WERE HOSPITALIZED AT THE CLEMENTE ALVAREZ HOSPITAL. JOSE IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, WHO RESIDES AT 1500 LARREA ST., WAS HIT BY BUCKSHOT AND LOST ONE EYE. ACCORDING TO POLICE, FIVE POLICEMEN SUFFERED VARIOUS TYPES OF WOUNDS. TWO POLICEMEN WERE HOSPITALIZED IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT OF THE CLEMENTE ALVAREZ HOSPITAL AFTER SUFFERING CONCUSSIONS FROM BLOWS INFLICTED ON THEM WITH THEIR OWN WEAPONS BY LOOTERS. THE INCIDENT OCCURRED NEAR A SUPERMARKET LOCATED AT THE INTERSECTION OF CORDOBA AND PERU STREETS, WHERE OFFICER OSCAR MARTINEZ AND CORPORAL LUIS GAUDANI WERE GUARDING THE SUPERMARKET. THEY WERE OVERPOWERED BY LOOTERS AFTER THEY DREW THEIR REGULATION WEAPONS TO FIRE WARNING SHOTS IN AN ATTEMPT TO DETER THE ATTACKERS.
DEV-MUC3-0219	CLANDESTINE, 28 MAY 89 -- POLITICAL PROPOSAL TO THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY: THE 1 JUNE SWEARING-IN OF THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE GOVERNMENT MEANS THE WORSENING AND THE PROLONGATION OF THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR. MEASURES CONDUCIVE TO INCREASING REPRESSION, LEGALIZING DEATH SQUADS POSING AS CIVIL DEFENSE UNITS, GIVING TOTAL IMMUNITY TO DEATH SQUAD MEMBERS IMPLICATED IN MURDERS SUCH AS THAT OF MSGR ARNULFO ROMERO, WORSENING SOCIAL CONFLICT WITH THE DIRECT OR INDIRECT ABOLITION OF FLEDGLING ECONOMIC REFORMS, AND DISMISSING PUBLIC EMPLOYEES EN MASSE CREATE A CLIMATE TOTALLY UNFAVORABLE TO TALKS BETWEEN THE SIDES. IN THE LIGHT OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT ONCE AGAIN MAKES A NEW EFFORT AND PROPOSES A PRACTICAL WAY TO OPEN UP THE POSSIBILITY OF TALKS AND UNDERSTANDING THAT MAY LEAD TO A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION AND LASTING PEACE IN EL SALVADOR: 1. RESUMPTION OF TALKS WITH POLITICAL PARTIES. THE FMLN FEELS POLITICAL PARTIES NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE ARENA GOVERNMENT MAY PLAY THE ROLE OF SPONSORS AND NEGOTIATORS OF THE DIALOGUE UNTIL DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN IS ACHIEVED. DURING THE OAXTEPEC MEETING, THE POLITICAL PARTIES ESTABLISHED THE NEED TO CONTINUE THE TALKS PAST 19 MARCH. THE FMLN DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE NOW TO REAFFIRM THIS NEED AND TO BEGIN TALKS AT A MUTUALLY AGREED ON PLACE AND DATE. DURING THESE MEETINGS BETWEEN THE OPPOSITION PARTIES THE FMLN, WE WOULD PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING PLATFORM OF COMMITMENTS WE FEEL THE FMLN AND THE NEW GOVERNMENT MUST ACCEPT AS MEASURES CONDUCIVE TOWARD CREATING THE CONDITIONS FOR A DIALOGUE AND DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE SIDES: 2. POLITICAL COMMITMENTS OF THE FMLN: A. TO ABSTAIN FROM ANY FORM OF ATTACK AGAINST POLITICAL LEADERS OF THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT. B. TO SUSPEND NATIONWIDE TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGES AND THUS SUSPEND SABOTAGE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. C. TO RESPECT THE LIVES, FREEDOM, AND WELL-BEING OF RELATIVES OF POLITICAL LEADERS AND OFFICERS IN THE GOVERNMENT AND IN THE ARMED FORCES AND TO RESPECT THEIR RESIDENCES. D. TO CONTINUE TO REFRAIN FROM USING ARTILLERY-EQUIPPED PLATFORMS, KNOW AS CAR BOMBS. E. TO RESPECT U.S. PERSONNEL AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN EL SALVADOR. F. TO SUSPEND SABOTAGE OF URBAN POWER POLES AND SHOPPING CENTERS.
DEV-MUC3-0220	BUENOS AIRES, 30 MAY 89 -- AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF WOUNDED PEOPLE, MOSTLY SUFFERING FROM CUTS, AND BROKEN WINDOWS AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE VELOX BANK ARE THE INITIAL RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION OF A BOMB AT 1215 ON THE DOWNTOWN CENTER OF SARMIENTO AND SAN MARTIN STREETS. ACCORDING TO THE FIRST RESULTS OF THE POLICE INVESTIGATION, THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICE HAD BEEN LEFT ON A BICYCLE THAT HAD BEEN LEFT NEAR THE BANK.
DEV-MUC3-0221	BUENOS AIRES, 30 MAY 89 -- IT HAS BEEN LEARNED FROM POLICE SOURCES THAT ANOTHER DEVICE HAS EXPLODED ON THE DOWNTOWN CORNER OF SARMIENTO AND SAN MARTIN STREETS, WHERE MANY BANKING INSTITUTIONS ARE LOCATED. THE FEDERAL POLICE BOMB SQUAD IS TRYING TO DETERMINE THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THIS SECOND BOMB, WHICH EXPLODED 30 MINUTES AFTER THE ONE THAT DAMAGED THE WINDOWS OF THE VELOX BANK.

THE MILITARY MAN EXPRESSED HIS CONFIDENCE TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT THE TWO ARRESTED MEN AND THE MATERIAL FOUND ON THEM WILL HELP DETERMINE THE IDENTITY OF THE PLANNERS AND PERPETRATORS -- NOT ONLY OF THIS ATTACK, BUT OF MANY POLITICAL CRIMES. HE ADDED THAT THE INCIDENT CALLS FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HIMSELF TO CARRY OUT THE INVESTIGATION AND; THUS, HE PREFERS THAT DAS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ABSTAIN FROM PARTICIPATING.

SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE SAID THAT THE GUERRILLAS ARE TRYING TO PIT ONE ARMY AGAINST THE OTHER BY DISTORTING THE REPORT ON THE INCIDENT. THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES HAVE SAID REPEATEDLY THAT THE GUERRILLAS' STRONGHOLDS ARE IN THE SALVADORAN REFUGEES CAMPS AND THAT THEY CONSTANTLY ENTER HONDURAN TERRITORY TO REST OR TO REPLENISH THEIR ARMS AND AMMUNITION SUPPLIES.

DEV-MUC3-0229	BOGOTA, 31 MAY 89 -- TERRORISM SEEMS NOT TO HAVE LET UP THROUGHOUT COLOMBIA. BOGOTA, CALI, AND MEDELLIN HAVE BEEN THE TARGETS OF DYNAMITE ATTACKS. LAST NIGHT, WHILE THE COUNTRY WAS STILL IN SHOCK OVER THE ATTACK AGAINST DAS DIRECTOR GENERAL MIGUEL ALFREDO MAZA MARQUEZ, A SHOPPING MALL IN MEDELLIN WAS SHAKEN BY THE EXPLOSION OF AN AVERAGE - SIZED BOMB AT THE CICLOTECNICA STORE ON 33D AND 42D STREETS.

DEV-MUC3-0230	LA PAZ, 26 MAY 89 -- INTERIOR MINISTER EDUARDO PEREZ BELTRAN HAS BLAMED THE MURDER OF TWO U.S. MORMON MISSIONARIES ON NARCOTERRORISTS, WHO WANT TO GIVE IT A POLITICAL CONNOTATION. "DRUG TRAFFICKERS MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN THIS CRIME, AND THEY WANT TO GIVE IT POLITICAL CONNOTATIONS," PEREZ SAID. PEREZ SAID THAT THE MRUDER OF THE TWO MISSIONARIES MIGHT BE A "COPYCAT MURDER" DONE WITH THE INTENTION OF BLAMING THE "ZARATE WILKA GROUP WITH HAVING DONE IT." HE ADDED THAT THE GROUP IS NAMED AFTER A PEASANT LEADER WHO LIVED EARLY THIS CENTURY. THE PEASANT HAD NO POLITICAL AFFILIATION WHATSOEVER. THIS IS WHY WE CAN NOT SAY WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT GUERRILLA GROUPS ARE OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY. THE FAL-ZARATE WILKA GROUP, WHICH CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS CRIME, LEFT A HANDWRITTEN MESSAGE TO THE EFFECT THAT THEIR WAR IS TO KILL "THE YANKEE INVADERS WHO COME HERE TO MASSACRE OUR PEASANT BROTHERS." REFERRING TO THE MESSAGE LEFT AT THE SCENE, THE INTERIOR MINISTER SAID THAT AN INITIAL ANALYSIS OF THE MESSAGE REVEALS THAT IT WAS WRITTEN IN LANGUAGUE NOT COMMONLY USED BY A LEFTIST POLITICAL ORGANIZATION. THE MESSAGE IS VAGUE WHEN IT REFERS TO BOTH NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND THE EXPLOITATION OF PEASANTS. THIS IS A CRIME IN WHICH DRUG TRAFFICKERS MIGHT BE INVOLVED AND TO WHICH THEY WANT TO ATTACH A POLITICAL CONNOTATION," PEREZ SAID. PEREZ ADDED THAT IN RECENT DAYS "THERE HAVE BEEN RUMORS THAT MEMBERS OF THE U.S. ARMED FORCES HAVE COME TO BOLIVIA WITH PLANS TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING. WE HAVE TO REJECT THOSE RUMORS." HE SAID THAT THIS CRIME IS IN NO WAY LINKED TO THE PRESENCE OF "SHINING PATH" TERRORISTS IN BOLIVIA. HE SAID: "IF THIS TERRORIST GROUP IS OPERATING IN BOLIVIA, IT SHOULD HAVE CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS CRIME, LIKE THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY DID IN THE 1960'S WHEN THEY REVEALED THAT THEY CARRIED OUT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES ABROAD." PEREZ STATED THAT MURDER OF THE U.S. MORMON MISSIONARIES SHOULD BE SERIUSLY ANALYZED SO THAT A RELIABLE REPORT IS RELEASED.
DEV-MUC3-0231	LA PAZ, 2 JUN 89 -- GENERAL MARIO MOLINA, CHIEF OF THE BOLIVIAN POLICE, HAS ADMITTED THAT THE COUNTRY IS SUFFERING THE EFFECTS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TERRORISM PRACTICED BY EXTREMIST GROUPS WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN OFFICIALLY IDENTIFIED. THE POLICE CHIEF REQUESTED THE COOPERATION OF THE CITIZENRY BY REPORTING ANY INFORMATION ON EXTREMISTS. HE GUARANTEED THAT ANYONE REPORTING ON EXTREMISTS WILL REMAIN ANONYMOUS. GEN MOLINA SAID THAT THE POLICE CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE THE MURDER OF TWO AMERICAN CITIZENS WITH THE AID OF U.S. EXPERTS WHO ARE GIVING BOLIVIA POLICE LOGISTIC AND SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT. THEIR SUPPORT, HE SAID, ALLOWS THE BOLIVIA POLICE THEIR OWN LIMITATIONS. THE POLICE CHIEF SAID THAT THE OBJECTS FOUND IN THE SCENE OF THE MURDER HAVE BEEN SENT TO WASHINGTON FOR BALLISTIC AND LABORATORY EXAMINATIONS. MEANWHILE, THE POLICE ARE PREPARING THE IDENTI-KIT OF THE ALLEGED MURDERERS BASED ON THE DESCRIPTION OF WITNESSES.

DEV-MUC3-0232	SAN JOSE , 2 JUN 89 -- THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND HAS AGREED TO "CONTINUE" THE DIALOGUE WITH THE NEW SALAVADORAN GOVERNMENT, WHICH WAS SWORN IN YESTERDAY. THE FMLN ALSO PROPOSES CHANNELS TO FOLLOW FOR STARTING THE DIALOGUE. SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI OF THE RIGHT-WING NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE YESTERDAY PROPOSED TO THE GUERRILLAS THAT THEY BEGIN A DIALOGUE TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION THAT WILL END THE ARMED CONFLICT IN THAT NATION. A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION "CAN LEAD TO PEACE IN EL SALVADOR," THE FMLN ASSERTED IN A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED TODAY IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, AND SIGNED BY COMMANDERS FRANCISCO JOVEL, SHAFIK JORGE HANDAL, SALVADOR SANCHEZ CEREN, EDUARDO SANCHO, AND JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS. THE FMLN PROPOSES "COORDINATING A CEASE-FIRE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF AN OVERALL NEGOTIATION OF THE CONFLICT," WITHOUT TRYING TO "APPLY THE SAME MEANS USED IN THE CASE OF THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS." IN EXCHANGE, THE REBELS DEMAND "THE TRIAL OF FORMER MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON AND ALL THOSE INVOLVED IN MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO'S MURDER," AS WELL AS "THE COMPLETE EXCLUSION" OF D'AUBUISSON FROM ANY GOVERNMENT POSITION. D'AUBUISSON, WHO HAS DENIED ANY INVOLVEMENT IN THE SALVADORAN ARCHBISHOP'S ASSASSINATION, FOUNDED ARENA, WHICH WON THE 19 MARCH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. THE GUERRILLAS DEMAND "THE DISBANDMENT OF THE DEATH SQUADS." THEY ALSO WANT THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO PROCEED WITH THE CREATION OF THE PATRIOTIC CIVIL DEFENSE GROUPS. THE REBELS REQUEST "THE IMMEDIATE RELEASE" OF LABOR LEADERS, MASS MOVEMENT ACTIVISTS, AND DETAINED POLITICAL PRISONERS, AND THEY DEMAND THAT MURDERS, KIDNAPPINGS, AND ALL OTHER FORMS OF REPRESSION AGAINST THE OPPOSITION PARTIES CEASE. THE COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT THE REBELS ARE WILLING TO AGREE TO A CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT "WHEN IT IS AGREED UPON AND IMPLEMENTED UNDER INTERNATIONAL SUPERVISION," AS WELL AS TO A MULTILATERAL CUTBACK OF MILITARY SUPPLIES "OF ANY KIND TO ALL THE CENTRAL AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS AND GROUPS INVOLVED IN A CONFLICT." THE FMLN COMMAND PLEDGES THAT ONCE THE DIALOGUE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED, IT WILL "REFRAIN FROM ATTACKING POLITICAL LEADERS OF THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT" AND FROM ENFORCING NATIONWIDE TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGES. THE FMLN OFFERS TO "RESPECT THE LIVES AND LIBERTY" OF POLITICAL AND MILITARY LEADERS' RELATIVES, AS WELL AS TO "SUSPEND" THE USE OF CAR BOMBS IN THE CITIES. THE GUERRILLAS ALSO COMMIT THEMSELVES TO RESPECTING "U.S. PERSONNEL AND INSTALLATIONS IN EL SALVADOR" AND TO SUSPENDING ATTACKS ON THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM AND ON URBAN SHOPPING CENTERS. DURING THE FIRST PHASE OF TALKS, THE GUERRILLAS POINT OUT, THE POLITICAL PARTIES NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE GOVERNMENT COULD PROMOTE AND ARRANGE THE DIALOGUE UNTIL "A DIRECT NEGOTIATION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN" IN PLACES AND ON DATES "MUTUALLY AGREED UPON" IS ACHIEVED. THE INSURGENT LEADERSHIP WARNS THAT IF A DIALOGUE BETWEEN BOTH PARTIES DOES NOT TAKE PLACE, THE INAUGURATION OF THE ARENA GOVERNMENT WILL MEAN "THE HEIGHTENING AND PROLONGATION OF THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR." THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE ALSO PROPOSES THAT AGRARIAN REFORM BE CONTINUED. THE REBELS ALSO WANT THE NATIONALIZATION OF BANKING AND OF FOREIGN TRADE, UNRESTRICTED FREEDOM OF INFORMATION, AND RESPECT FOR THE COMMITMENT MADE BY THE DUARTE ADMINISTRATION TO "EVACUATE THE WOUNDED AND MAIMED GUERRILLAS" AND TO RESPECT THE LIVES OF RELATIVES OF THE LEADERS OF MASS MOVEMENTS, OPPOSITION PARTIES, AND THE FMLN.

DEV-MUC3-0243	SAN SALVADOR, 9 JUN 89 -- THE PDC CONDEMNS THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENCY MINISTER DR ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH. IT BELIEVES VIOLENCE WILL NOT SOLVE THE COUNTRY'S PROBLEMS, IS NOT THE WAY TO SETTLE IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES, AND WILL NOT LEAD TO PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT. WE HOPE THIS CONDEMNABLE ACT WILL NOT BE FOLLOWED BY AN ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE AND REVENGE THAT WOULD ONLY SERVE TO FURTHER POLARIZE SALVADORAN SOCIETY. THE PDC EXPRESSES ITS CONDOLENCES TO THE REPUBLIC'S GOVERNMENT, THAT IS, THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE, AND RODRIGUEZ' GRIEVING FAMILY. WE URGE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, BASED ON MUTUAL RESPECT, TO FIND A POLITICAL AND PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS THAT IS CURRENTLY AFFLICTING OUR SOCIETY. THIS IS THE PDC'S POSITION ON THE CONDEMNABLE ASSASSINATION OF DR ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH. DR COLINDRES, DO YOU NOT BELIEVE THIS COULD LEAD TO AN ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE BY THE EXTREME RIGHT? WE HOPE REASON WILL PREVAIL IN THE COUNTRY. WE BELIEVE THIS OR ANY OTHER INCIDENT SHOULD NOT LEAD TO AN ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE, BECAUSE THAT WOULD ONLY RESULT IN MORE BLOODLETTING AMONG THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. I BELIEVE WE MUST NOT FALL FOR THE TRAP OF VIOLENCE THAT WOULD ONLY DESTROY US. IT IS PRESUMED THAT THIS ACTION INVOLVED LEFTIST URBAN COMMANDOS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT . DO YOU BELIEVE THAT POLITICAL GROUP IS RESPONSIBLE? LET US WAIT AND SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN, BECAUSE IT COULD HAVE BEEN THE FMLN OR ULTRARIGHTIST FACTIONS SEEKING FURTHER POLARIZATION AND BLOODLETTING. WE DO NOT WANT TO PASS JUDGMENT YET. REGARDLESS OF WHO DID IT, THIS IS AN ASSASSINATION, WHICH IS NOT THE PROPER WAY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AMONG SALVADORANS. IN THE PDC'S OPINION, WHAT SHOULD BE THE ROLE OF THE ARMED FORCES IN THE WAKE OF DR RODRIGUEZ PORTH'S ASSASSINATION? I BELIEVE THE ARMED FORCES MUST CONTINUE THEIR POLICY OF PROFESSIONALISM AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, BECAUSE THIS IMPLIES RESPECTING THE LAW AND STRENGTHENING THE INSTITUTION OF THE ARMED FORCES. THEY HAVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO GUARANTEE THE SAFETY AND CALM OF THE ENTIRE POPULATION. WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING? ONLY THAT WE HOPE THIS KIND OF REGRETTABLE AND CONDEMNABLE INCIDENT WILL NOT BE REPEATED. WE ALSO HOPE THAT VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION AMONG SALVADORAN BROTHERS WILL END ONCE AND FOR ALL.
DEV-MUC3-0244	SAN PEDRO SULA, 9 JUN 89 -- WHEN WE ASKED THE FOREIGN MINISTRY WHY THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT HAS NOT PROTESTED THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES ATTACKS ON HONDURAN ARMY SOLDIERS AND A HELICOPTER IN LOS LLANITOS , THE ANSWER WAS VERY SIMPLE, BUT IT SHOWS THE IMPORTANCE THAT IS GIVEN TO NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND INTEGRITY: THE ARMED FORCES HAVE NOT INFORMED US OF ANYTHING AT ALL -- THEY SAID -- AND WHAT THE MEDIA SAYS IS NOT ACCURATE. THE NEWSPAPERS TIEMPO AND LA PRENSA PUBLISHED REPORTS OF THE INCIDENT WITH PHOTOGRAPHS THAT CONFIRMED THE AGGRESSION, THE BOMBING AND SHELLING OF VILLAGES IN OUR TERRITORY, AND PROVIDED ACCOUNTS BY EYEWITNESSES AND MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES, BUT WHICH, ACCORDING TO THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, LACK CREDIBILITY OR IMPORTANCE. LATER FOREIGN NEWSMEN WENT TO THESE PLACES AND CONFIRMED WHAT TIEMPO AND LA PRENSA HAD REPORTED. THEY ALSO OBTAINED OTHER DETAILS ON THE INCIDENTS. WHILE THE HONDURAN AND SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES DENIED THE INCIDENT, DESPITE THE EVIDENCE, THE TRUTH IS THERE FOR THE GENTLEMEN OF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY TO SEE. ACCORDING TO STATEMENTS BY THE VILLAGERS WHO WERE THE VICTIMS OF THE SALVADORAN AGGRESSION, THE HONDURAN MILITARY THREATENED THEM AND ORDERED THEM TO BE SILENT OR TO LIE ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED. IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE SANTA LUCIA MAYOR TO INTERVENE BEFORE THEY COULD TELL NEWSMEN WHAT HAD HAPPENED. A REPORTER FOR LA PRENSA WAS SIDETRACKED BY A COMMANDER, NO DOUBT TO KEEP HIM FROM DOING HIS JOB AS A JOURNALIST. THE HONDURAN ARMY'S WEAPONS SERVED TO KEEP THE AGGRESSION QUIET INSTEAD OF REPELLING IT, TO THREATEN HONDURAN BORDER VILLAGERS INSTEAD OF PROTECTING THEM, WHILE THE ARMY TURNED ITS BACK ON THE ENEMY ARMED FORCES -- WHICH HAVE TRAMPLED ON OUR TERRITORY AND HUMILIATED US -- INSTEAD OF FIGHTING THEM. IN SHORT, THE WEAPONS THAT WE HONDURANS AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE OBTAINED WITH SO MUCH SACRIFICE, EVEN AT THE EXPENSE OF GOING WITHOUT FOOD AND MEDICINE, ARE USED AGAINST HONDURAS AND ITS PEOPLE. THIS SITUATION SHOULD CAUSE US TO GIVE MUCH THOUGHT TO THE EXISTENCE OF THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES. WE ANTICIPATED THIS WHEN THE REGIONAL MILITARY TRAINING AND SECURITY CENTER WAS CREATED EXCLUSIVELY TO TRAIN 10,000 SALVADORAN TROOPS -- THE SAME ARMY THAT INVADED US IN 1969 AND THAT IS ATTACKING US AGAIN. WE WONDER IF WE ARE NOT ACQUIRING A MERCENARY MENTALITY IN HONDURAS, WHEREBY THE STATE'S WEAPONS GO TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER RATHER THAN BEING USED IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST. FOR THE PAST 7 YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN USED FOR ECONOMIC -- THOUGH IDEOLOGICALLY DISGUISED -- BENEFITS. NO NATIONAL MILITARY FORCE CAN FUNCTION LIKE THIS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. IN ANY EVENT, THE IDEOLOGY OF ANY ARMY SHOULD BE NATIONALISTIC, EVEN IN THE CASE OF POWERS AND SUPERPOWERS THAT INVENT AND USE INTERNATIONALIST IDEOLOGIES FOR THEIR HEGEMONIC STRUGGLES. HERE IN HONDURAS THE CASE OF THE ARMED FORCES IS JUST THE OPPOSITE. TO THE MILITARY INSTITUTE'S WAY OF THINKING, THOSE WHO ARE DEMANDING THE DEFENSE OF SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY ARE SUBVERSIVES WHO ARE ALLIED WITH SUBVERSIVES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. AN AGGRESSION AGAINST HONDURAS BY A FOREIGN ARMY IS LEGITIMIZED BY THE PEOPLE ATTACKED AND THOSE WHO INFORM AND PROTEST ARE ENEMIES OF THE FATHERLAND. THIS WAS STATED IN AN EDITORIAL OF THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES' "MILITARY PROJECTIONS" PROGRAM. THE EDITORIAL SAID THAT THE REPORT WAS ISSUED "WITHOUT PRIOR INVESTIGATION" AND WAS BASED SOLELY "ON INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THESE GROUPS TO CONFUSE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION." "THE IRRESPONSIBILITY OF SOME PRINT AND BROADCAST MEDIA DIRECTORS HAS REACHED THE POINT THAT THEY ARE PROMOTING THESE CLEARLY MARXIST - LENINIST SUBVERSIVES, FINANCED BY CUBA AND NICARAGUA, AND THOSE WHO DO NOT HIDE THEIR OPEN SYMPATHY WITH PSEUDO-PROFESSIONAL POSITIONS. THEY ATTEMPT TO CONCEAL THIS BY CLAIMING THAT RADIO STATIONS OR NEWSPAPERS HAVE UNRESTRICTED FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION." A SIMILAR EXPLANATION WAS PRESENTED BY THE SALVADORAN EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA IN A PRESS COMMUNIQUE DISTRIBUTED TO THE MEDIA, WHICH PUBLISHED AND DISSEMINATED IT -- ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS INCREDIBLE -- THROUGH THE OFFICIAL PRESIDENTIAL HOUSE BULLETINS. WE MIGHT ADD THAT THE HONDURAN ARMY HAS ECHOED SUCH REPORTS, AS AN ACCOMPLICE TO A PROPAGANDA PLOY TO COVER UP AN AGGRESSION AGAINST OUR COUNTRY. WE ASK, THEREFORE: "WHAT IS LEFT OF OUR NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS? WHAT IS HONDURAS? WHO ARE HONDURANS?"
DEV-MUC3-0245	LIMA, 10 JUN 89 -- ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS IN LIMA TODAY, DAVID OROSCO TELLO , THIRD IN COMMAND OF THE SHINING PATH GUERRILLA GROUP, DIED DURING A CLASH WITH A PERUVIAN ARMY MILITARY PATROL IN APURIMAC DEPARTMENT, SOUTHEAST OF LIMA. ACCORDING TO THE PRESS, THE ARMY PATROL KILLED 15 SHINING PATH GUERRILLAS IN A CLASH ON 5 JUNE, BUT OROSCO TELLO WAS ONLY YESTERDAY IDENTIFIED BY MILITARY AND FORENSIC EXPERTS OF THE APURIMAC DEPARTMENT POLITICAL AND MILITARY COMMAND. THE GUERRILLA GROUP REPORTEDLY SUFFERED 15 CASUALTIES, WHILE NONE OF THE MILITARY MEN WERE KILLED. AFTER THE CLASH, THE ARMY SEIZED A LIGHT AUTOMATIC RIFLE , 2 MAUSER RIFLES, 250 STICKS OF DYNAMITE, 22 HOMEMADE BOMBS, 6 CARTRIDGE POUCHES, A LARGE AMOUNT OF SLOW FUSE AND DETONATOR CORD, MAPS, NOTEBOOKS, AND PASSPORTS. THE ARMY REPORTED THAT IN ANOTHER CLASH WITH THE SHINING PATH, WHICH TOOK PLACE IN THE PARINACOCHAS PROVINCE OF AYACUCHO DEPARTMENT, SOUTHEAST OF LIMA, SIX GUERRILLAS WERE KILLED AND A SMALL ARSENAL -- THREE MAUSER RIFLES, AMMUNITIONS FOR FAL, UZI, AND AKN RIFLES, DYNAMITE, AND PROPAGANDA MATERIAL -- WAS SEIZED.
DEV-MUC3-0246	PERTH , JUNE 11 89 -- DEPORTED CHILEAN SECURITY WAS TIGHT AT PERTH INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AS MR. BUSCHMANN, 46, WAS GIVEN AN ENTHUSIASTIC SEND-OFF BY ABOUT 50 LOCAL SUPPORTERS, MOST OF THEM MEMBERS OF THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN CHILEAN COMMUNITY. BEFORE BOARDING HIS AIRCRAFT, MR. BUSCHMANN SAID THROUGH AN INTERPRETER THAT HE HAD ACHIEVED HIS GOAL IN AUSTRALIA BY PUBLICISING THE POSITION OF THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT IN CHILE. THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE INDICATION OF MR. BUSCHMANN'S ULTIMATE DESTINATION, WHICH WAS EXPECTED TO BE SOMEWHERE IN EUROPE. HE HAS REFUGEE STATUS IN SWEDEN, THE COUNTRY FROM WHICH HE MADE HIS VISA APPLICATION BEFORE BEING ALLOWED INTO AUSTRALIA LAST MONTH. THE AUSTRALIAN IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT ARRANGED HIS SUNDAY NIGHT FLIGHT ON SATURDAY AFTER THE FEDERAL COURT HERE HAD UPHELD A DEPORTATION ORDER AGAINST HIM ON FRIDAY. MR. BUSCHMANN HAD ORIGINALLY PLANNED TO SPEND TWO MONTHS IN AUSTRALIA PUBLICISING, AND RAISING FUNDS FOR, THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ MOVEMENT, WHICH IS OPPOSED TO THE REGIME OF GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET AND WHICH HE HEADS. THE IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT CUT SHORT HIS TRIP, CLAIMING HE HAD MADE FALSE OR MISLEADING STATEMENTS IN HIS VISA APPLICATION. MR. BUSCHMANN WAS ARRESTED AND DETAINED IN PERTH FOR THREE DAYS BEFORE BEING RELEASED FIVE DAYS AGO ON THE ORDERS OF THE FEDERAL COURT TO BE PLACED UNDER VIRTUAL HOUSE ARREST PENDING THE OUTCOME OF FRIDAY'S HEARING. HE HAD BEEN STAYING AT THE HOME OF WESTERN AUSTRALIAN STATE LABOR MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, DR. IAN ALEXANDER. HE PARTICULARLY UPSET THE AUSTRALIAN AUTHORITIES BY PUBLICLY CALLING FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF GEN. PINOCHET. AFTER HIS ARRIVAL SANTIAGO APPLIED TO CANBERRA FOR HIS EXTRADITION.
DEV-MUC3-0247	MANAGUA , 15 JUN 89 -- MR MINISTER : VARIOUS HONDURAN PRESS SOURCES HAVE REPORTED ON THE 13 JUNE MEETING BETWEEN THE U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND LEADERS OF THE MERCENARY GROUPS, AMONG THEM ENRIQUE BERMUDEZ, WHO HAVE BEEN USING HONDURAN TERRITORY AS A BASE AND SANCTUARY FOR ITS CRIMINAL ACTIONS AGAINST NICARAGUA. THESE MERCENARY GROUPS HAVE CONTINUED THEIR ATTACKS AGAINST NICARAGUA, ADDING NEW VICTIMS TO THE THOUSANDS OF CITIZENS WHO HAVE ALREADY SUFFERED THE EFFECTS OF U.S. AGGRESSION AND THE PARTICIPATION AND COMPLICITY OF YOUR GOVERNMENT WITH THAT ILLEGAL POLICY. THE WELL-KNOWN U.S. POLICY OF MAINTAINING CONTRA FORCES IN HONDURAN TERRITORY AND ITS CONSTANT CRIMINAL ATTACKS AGAINST THE NICARAGUAN POPULATION -- WHICH HAVE LEFT 163 CIVILIAN VICTIMS SINCE THE COSTA DEL SOL SUMMIT ON 31 MAY -- CHARACTERIZES THE TALKS BETWEEN U.S. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND CONTRA LEADERS, AS WELL AS THE TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES IN THE LOSS OF HUMAN LIVES AND PROPERTY DAMAGE IN MY COUNTRY. WHILE VICE PRESIDENT QUAYLE WAS MEETING WITH THE MERCENARIES, PASTORAL REPRESENTATIVES IN WASLALA AND LAS MINAS INFORMED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OF THE HUNDREDS OF PEASANTS WHO HAVE BEEN MURDERED, KIDNAPPED, AND TORTURED BY THE MERCENARY GROUPS THAT INFILTRATE NICARAGUA FROM HONDURAS. AT THE SAME TIME, THE DEFENSE MINISTRY REPORTED ON THE CONTINUATION OF ATTACKS AGAINST AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVES, AMONG THEM ONE IN SAN JOSE, TIJUANA, SOUTHEAST OF ASTURIAS, JINOTEGA DEPARTMENT, WHERE FOUR PEASANTS WERE KILLED ON 10 JUNE. IN THE COSTA DEL SOL DECLARATION, THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO CARRYING OUT THE DEMOBILIZATION, REPATRIATION, AND RELOCATION OF THE MERCENARY GROUPS CURRENTLY BASED IN YOUR COUNTRY. HOWEVER, YOUR GOVERNMENT HAS SUPPORTED -- AGAINST THE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS OF THE HONDURAN PEOPLE -- THE OPTION SET FORTH BY A U.S. BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT AIMED AT MAINTAINING THE CONTRAS IN HONDURAN TERRITORY. INTERVIEWS WITH HONDURAN POLITICAL LEADERS, SUCH AS THE ONE PUBLISHED IN THE DAILY LA TRIBUNA IN ITS 13 JUNE EDITION, CLEARLY STATE THAT THE U.S. VICE PRESIDENT DID NOT GO TO HONDURAS TO SOLVE ITS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, BUT TO OBTAIN A CONFIRMATION FROM THE GOVERNMENT THAT IT WILL NOT EXPEL THE CONTRAS FROM HONDURAN TERRITORY. IN CONSENTING TO THE CONTINUED PRESENCE IN ITS TERRITORY OF MERCENARY FORCES -- WHICH WERE CREATED TO ATTACK MY COUNTRY -- THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT IS NOT ONLY HELPING TO BRING MORE SUFFERING AND DESTRUCTION TO THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE AND NATION, BUT IS ALSO CONTINUING THE HEAVY BURDEN ON THE HONDURAN PEOPLE, WHO HAVE ALSO BEEN THE VICTIMS OF CRIMINAL AND TERRORIST ACTIONS. WITH THIS BEHAVIOR, THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT ONCE AGAIN EVINCES ITS TOTAL NONCOMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS, WHICH ARE ALSO EXPRESSED IN THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENTS, TO NOT PERMIT THE USE OF ITS TERRITORY TO ATTACK OTHER STATES AND TO DISCONTINUE ITS SUPPORT FOR IRREGULAR FORCES. THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT STRONGLY PROTESTS THE FACT THAT YOUR COUNTRY CONTINUES TO ALLOW THE USE OF ITS TERRITORY TO CONDUCT ILLEGAL POLICIES THAT GO AGAINST THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENTS AND THE PEACE EFFORTS AND THAT VIOLATE THE PRINCIPLES AND NORMS ESTABLISHED BY INTERNATIONAL LAW TO GUARANTEE THE PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE OF STATES. YOUR GOVERNMENT SHOULD REFLECT ON THIS AND HEED THE CALLS MADE BY THE HONDURAN PEOPLE THEMSELVES, WHO DEMAND AN END TO THE COUNTRY'S INVOLVEMENT IN AN ILLEGAL AND ADVENTUROUS POLICY AND THAT THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED IN COSTA DEL SOL CALLING FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A JOINT PLAN FOR THE DEMOBILIZATION, REPATRIATION, AND RELOCATION OF THE IRREGULAR FORCES BASED IN YOUR COUNTRY BE HONORED. I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO REITERATE MY ESTEEM TO YOUR EXCELLENCY. MIGUEL D'ESCOTO BROCKMAN, FOREIGN MINISTER, REPUBLIC OF NICARAGUA
DEV-MUC3-0248	SAO PAULO , 14 JUN 89 -- THE ARGENTINA GOVERNMENT HAS SENT TO BRAZIL A REQUEST OF PREVENTIVE IMPRISONMENT FOR THE EXTRADITION OF 16 PEOPLE CHARGED WITH BELONGING TO THE "ALL FOR THE FATHERLAND" TERRORIST GROUP. THE MEN ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE TAKEN PART IN THE ATTACK ON THE LA TABLADA MILITARY UNIT IN BUENOS AIRES PROVINCE LAST JANUARY. AT THE ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT'S REQUEST, FERNANDO CARLOS FALCO WAS ARRESTED ON 9 JUNE. HE REMAINS IN CUSTODY IN FEDERAL POLICE QUARTERS IN BRASILIA, AND HE IS WAITING THE EXTRADITION RULING, WHICH WILL BE MADE BY THE FEDERAL SUPREME CORT . ANOTHER ARGENTINE, DAMIAN MAGUE, WHO WAS ALSO INVOLVED IN THE LA TABLADA ATTACK, WAS ARRESTED WITH FALCO ON THE SAME DAY. MAGUE WAS RELEASED BECAUSE THE ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT DID NOT REQUEST HIS PREVENTIVE IMPRISONMENT, THE STF SAID. IN FALCO'S CASE, THE ARGENTINE COURTS HAVE 45 DAYS TO SEND THE STF A COPY OF THE LEGAL CASE AGAINST HIM. THE TRIAL WILL BE BASED ON THE LEGAL EXTRADITION REQUISITES AND NOT ON THE CRIMINAL ACCUSATIONS AGAINST FALCO.
DEV-MUC3-0249	CLANDESTINE, 15 JUN 89 -- CONCERNING DR JOSE ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH'S DEATH, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND REPORTS THE FOLLOWING TO ALL SALVADORANS: 1. AS A RESULT OF INVESTIGATIONS WE HAVE CONDUCTED, WE CONFIRM THAT THE FMLN BEARS NO RESPONSIBILITY WHATSOEVER FOR THE ATTACK ON DR RODRIGUEZ PORTH. WE DELAYED MAKING THIS STATEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THERE WERE NO CIRCUMSTANTIAL OR OTHER REASONS THAT COULD HAVE INVOLVED US IN THE ATTACK. 2. FOLLOWING RODRIGUEZ PORTH'S DEATH, SEVERAL GROUPS HAVE CONDUCTED MARKEDLY VENGEFUL ACTIONS. COLONEL OCHOA PEREZ, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS PROPOSED FIGHTING FIRE WITH FIRE. FRANCISCO MERINO HAS THREATENED OPPOSITION LEADERS WITH DEATH. RICARDO ALVARENGA VALDIVIESO HAS PROPOSED REPRESSIVE NEW LAWS. WE HEREBY WARN THAT IF REPRISALS ARE TAKEN AGAINST THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT, WE WILL TAKE FIRM AND RESOLUTE ACTION AGAINST ANY ESCALATION IN REPRESSION. 3. WE FIND THE FALSE COMMOTION AMONG THE RANKS OF THE ARENA PARTY REPULSIVE, BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY IN KILLINGS LIKE THAT OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO, OF THE MEMBERS OF THE FDR EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, AND SO MANY OTHERS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN THEIR ALLEGED INNOCENCE, AND DO EVEN LESS AT A TIME WHEN REPRESSIVE ACTIONS ARE BEING INTENSIFIED. 4. OUR ATTENTION HAS BEEN DRAWN TO THE FACT THAT THE ATTACK ON RODRIGUEZ PORTH OCCURRED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF AN INTENSE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SECTOR AND D'AUBUISSON'S SUPPORTERS TO GAIN CONTROL OF THE PARTY, AND WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A DISPUTE FOR THE DEFENSE MINISTRY. IN THE LATTER CASE, RODRIGUEZ PORTH'S ACTIONS DID AWAY WITH GENERAL BUSTILLO'S ASPIRATIONS. THERE ARE PRECEDENTS FOR THE LINE OF CONDUCT OF ARENA FACTIONS AND FOR THESE INTERNAL CONFRONTATIONS. WE RECALL THE ATTACK THAT ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON PERPETRATED AGAINST FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR THOMAS PICKERING. WE ALSO REMEMBER HOW IMPORTANT MEN CLOSE TO MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSION PARTICIPATED IN THE KIDNAPPING OF BUSINESSMEN. MAJOR D'AUBUISSION'S SILENCE CONCERNING THE ATTACK ON RODRIGUEZ PORTH IS NOTEWORTHY. THE FMLN UNDERSTANDS THE CONCERN OF THE VARIOUS NATIONAL SECTORS AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN THE SENSE THAT ARENA MAY USE THIS FACT TO JUSTIFY IRRATIONAL RETALIATORY ACTIONS. IF A SITUATION IS BROUGHT ABOUT, INVOLVING AN INCREASE IN VIOLENCE AND EXPANSION OF THE WAR, IT WILL BE THE ARENA GOVERNMENT'S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY, NOT OURS. FOR THIS REASON, WE HAVE RAISED WITH THE POLITICAL PARTIES THE NEED TO CREATE CONDITIONS FOR ESTABLISHING A FAVORABLE CLIMATE FOR DIALOGUE AND A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION. WE REITERATE OUR TOTAL READINESS TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD THIS EFFORT. THE FMLN REASSERTS TO ALL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO ADHERE TO THE TRUTH AND THAT THAT WE WILL BE FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS AT ALL TIMES AND UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. FMLN GENERAL COMMAND 15 JUNE 198, EL SALVADOR
DEV-MUC3-0250	SANTIAGO, 16 JUN 89 -- TODAY, THE CHILEAN MILITARY GOVERNMENT HAS REPORTED THE EXISTENCE OF A SELECTIVE TERRORIST PLAN TO ATTACK GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, A PLAN THAT COULD BE LINKED TO THE SHINING PATH, A PERUVIAN TERRORIST GROUP. GENERAL OSCAR VARGAS, THE MINISTER SECRETARY GENERAL OF GOVERNMENT, REPORTED ON THIS PLAN DURING A 2-HOUR CABINET MEETING THAT WAS CHAIRED BY CHILEAN PRESIDENT GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET. THE MINISTER SAID THAT THERE ARE CLEAR INDICATIONS OF SUCH A PLAN, EMPHASIZING THAT THE CIVILIANS HAVE GREAT RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE SUBVERSION CANNOT BE CONDUCTED WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF CIVILIANS. GEN VARGAS POINTED OUT THAT THE RECENT ATTACKS ON ARMED FORCES AND THE SECURITY SERVICES PERSONNEL, THE ROBBERY OF CARS -- ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, A MILITARY TRUCK AND 18 PRIVATE VEHICLES HAVE BEEN STOLEN -- AND THE STEALING OF CAR LICENSE PLATES AT THE MUNICIPALITIES ARE A CLEAR INDICATION THAT THESE GROUPS ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN THEIR ACTIVITIES. THIS WEEK, SEVERAL UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS ATTACKED AN ARMY NON- COMMISSIONED OFFICER, WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER AND WHO WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED, AND LAST WEEK A RETIRED AIR FORCE OFFICER WAS MURDERED. THE MINISTER ADDED THAT A COORDINATION AMONG ALL THE TERRORIST GROUPS THAT ARE OPERATING IN THE AREA HAS BEEN NOTICED, ESPECIALLY BY THE SHINING PATH. THIS MATTER WAS DISCUSSED BY THE PERUVIAN DEFENSE MINISTER IN A SPEECH HE MADE IN LIMA LAST WEEK. CONCERNING THE MEASURES TAKEN, GEN VARGAS SAID: "ALL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO TAKE CARE." GEN VARGAS CATEGORICALLY DENIED THAT THE POSSIBILITY THAT GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET COULD RUN IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR 14 DECEMBER 1989 WAS DISCUSSED IN THE CABINET MEETING HELD TODAY AT THE LA MONEDA PRESIDENTIAL PALACE. FOR HIS PART AND IN A NEWS CONFERENCE, SERGIO ONOFRE JARPA, A RIGHTWING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE PROGOVERNMENT NATIONAL RENEWAL PARTY, SAID THAT HIS NOMINATION "WOULD NOT MAKE ANY SENSE IF PINOCHET RUNS FOR THE SAME POLITICAL SECTOR." JARPA REITERATED THAT IF THE INCUMBENT, WHO HAS BEEN PRESIDENT SINCE 1973, WANTS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT, "IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO REFORM THE 1980 CONSTITUTION" BECAUSE ARTICLE 25 PREVENTS THE CHILEAN PRESIDENT FROM SEEKING RE-ELECTION.
DEV-MUC3-0251	SAN SALVADOR, 16 JUN 89 -- HURTADO PRESIDENT CRISTIANI THIS MORNING DELIVERED PART OF THE COFFEE TAX, WHICH WILL BE DISTRIBUTED AMONG ALL THE MAYORS' OFFICES IN THE COUNTRY. AFTER THE EVENT AT A SAN SALVADOR HOTEL, CRISTIANI ANSWERED QUESTIONS, FIRST ON THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT COMMUNIQUE DENYING PARTICIPATION IN THE MURDER OF PRESIDENCY MINISTER JOSE ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH. IN THE COMMUNIQUE, THE FMLN FLATLY DECLARED THAT NONE OF THEIR MEMBERS HAD HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE MURDER. CRISTIANI HAD THIS TO SAY: THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND SAID THEY HAD NOT ORDERED THE ASSASSINATION AND ADDED THAT APPARENTLY A GROUP GOT OUT OF HAND AND PERPETRATED THE CRIME. I THINK THE FMLN HAS REALIZED THE GENERAL REPUDIATION THIS ACTION HAS ELICITED. I AM CONVINCED THE FMLN IS TRYING TO EXCUSE THE ACTION, THUS AVOIDING ALL RESPONSIBILITY. WE THINK THEY ARE TRYING TO SEEK A WAY OUT OF THE PROBLEM CAUSED BY THE ASSASSINATION OF AN AGED, DEFENSELESS PERSON. BUT THERE IS NO WAY OUT FOR THEM NOW. THE FMLN HAS DENIED THAT ANY OF ITS MEMBERS PARTICIPATED IN THE ACTION. OF COURSE, THEY ARE NOW TRYING TO DENY IT AFTER THEY LEARNED OF THE REPUDIATION BOTH HERE AND ABROAD. IN ADDITION, THEY WAITED A CONSIDERABLE TIME TO DENY THEIR PARTICIPATION. THEY HAD A COMPLETE PLAN AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. AS YOU KNOW, THE PLAN IS CALLED "ALL AGAINST ARENA ." THIS MURDER WAS PART OF THEIR PLAN. RODRIGUEZ PORTH HAD NO ENEMIES. HE WAS A PEACEFUL MAN WHO STRUGGLED WITH HIS PEN AND IDEAS. ONLY AN IRRATIONAL MIND, LIKE THAT OF THOSE WHO ADVOCATE VIOLENCE, COULD HAVE CONCEIVED THIS ACTION. I AM CONVINCED THE FMLN DID IT. MR PRESIDENT, IF YOU AND THE ARE CONVINCED THE FMLN IS GUILTY, WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE DIALOGUE? WE THINK WE SHOULD OVERCOME THE EFFECT OF THIS HEAVY BLOW CAUSED BY THE LOSS, NOT ONLY OF A COLUMN OF THE PARTY AND OF OUR IDEOLOGY, BUT ALSO OF A PERSONAL FRIEND. AS MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT, WE SHOULD OVERCOME OUR GRIEF AND SEEK THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY. WE BELIEVE VIOLENCE IS REPUDIATED AND REJECTED IN THE COUNTRY. IT IS TIME FOR THE FMLN TO TALK ABOUT ITS OBJECTIVES. THEY HAVE REJECTED THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH THE GOVERNMENT WITH UNACCEPTABLE AND UNJUSTIFIABLE ARGUMENTS. BUT OUR PROPOSAL FOR DIALOGUE IS STILL GOOD. WE ARE WILLING TO SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH THEM SO THIS VIOLENCE CAN END. HAS A COMMISSION ALREADY BEEN FORMED? WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF FORMING IT. SOME OF THE PROPOSED PERSONS HAVE ALREADY AGREED TO BE MEMBERS. WE HOPE TO HAVE FORMED THE COMMISSION BY THE END OF THE WEEK. AS SOON AS WE HAVE IT, WE WILL GLADLY ANNOUNCE THE MEMBERS' NAMES.
DEV-MUC3-0252	SANTIAGO, 26 JUN 89 -- TERRORIST SERGIO BUSCHMANN, WHO HAD BEEN HELD IN PREVENTIVE CUSTODY IN ALASKA, WAS SET FREE BY U.S. AUTHORITIES. THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT HAS EXPRESSED ITS FRUSTRATION OVER THAT DECISION, NOTING THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE ALL NECESSARY STEPS AT EVERY OCCASION TO BRING SERGIO BUSCHMANN TO COURT IN CHILE. THE INFORMATION WAS MADE PUBLIC BY CHILEAN FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN CARLOS DUCCI WHEN HE RELEASED AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE FROM THE FOREIGN MINISTRY. THE FOREIGN MINISTRY WAS INFORMED TODAY BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE THAT BECAUSE OF LEGAL TECHNICALITIES RELATED TO INTERPRETATIONS OF THE BILATERAL EXTRADITION TREATY OF 1900, IT CANNOT KEEP SERGIO BUSCHMANN IN PREVENTIVE CUSTODY, NOR CAN IT COMPLY WITH THE EXTRADITION REQUEST THAT IS BEING PREPARED IN CHILE. THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT MAKES PUBLIC ITS DISAPPOINTMENT AT THIS DECISION BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM THAT SOME COUNTRIES SHOULD LIMIT THEMSELVES TO EXPELLING THE TERRORIST BUSCHMANN FROM THEIR TERRITORY. WE HAVE REQUESTED THAT JUSTICE BE ALLOWED TO OPERATE SO THAT BUSCHMANN CAN BE SUBMITTED TO DUE PROCESS IN A CASE OF A STRICTLY JUDICIAL NATURE. BUSCHMANN HAS BEEN INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED AS A TERRORIST; HE HAS ENDORSED VIOLENCE, INCITED ASSASSINATION, AND RAISED FUNDS FOR THE PURCHASE OF ARMS TO KILL CHILEANS. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS HAD AT THE PROPER TIME THE OPPORTUNITY TO INSPECT THE ARMS CLANDESTINELY INTRODUCED IN CHILE FOR TERRORIST PURPOSES BY SERGIO BUSCHMANN. THIS ACT HAS BEEN PUBLICLY CONDEMNED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE, BECAUSE IT REVEALED THE THREAT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM POSES TO THE SECURITY OF THE HEMISPHERE. THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN AND WILL TAKE ALL NECESSARY STEPS AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO BRING BUSCHMANN TO COURT, AND IT MUST NOW DEPLORE AND REJECT THE IMPUNITY WITH WHICH THIS AVOWED CRIMINAL WILL CONTINUE TO ENDORSE TERRORISM AND VIOLENCE ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE. TERRORIST SERGIO BUSCHMANN, SPOKESMAN FOR THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT, HAS THE STATUS OF POLITICAL REFUGEE IN SWEDEN. WHEN CARLOS DUCCI WAS ASKED IF BUSCHMANN HAS TRAVELED TO SWEDEN, HE REPLIED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW AND THAT HE ONLY HAS INFORMATION THAT BUSCHMANN HAS BEEN SET FREE.
DEV-MUC3-0253	MANAGUA , 17 JUN 89 -- NICARAGUA HAS DENIED ANY LINKS WITH THE ASSASSINATION OF SALVADORAN PRESIDENCY MINISTER ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH 8 DAYS AGO, AN ALLEGATION MADE BY THE SALVADORAN ARMY. AT A NEWS CONFERENCE, COMMANDER BAYARDO ARCE, VICE COORDINATOR OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMISSION OF THE RULING SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FSLN, TERMED IRRESPONSIBLE THE CHARGES MADE IN SAN SALVADOR THAT NICARAGUA TRAINED THE COMMANDO WHO KILLED RODRIGUEZ PORTH. ARCE SAID: WE LACK THE EXPERIENCE FOR SUCH ATTACKS AND THEREFORE COULD NOT HAVE TRAINED ANYONE. HE RECALLED THAT THE FSLN NEVER RESORTED TO THAT TYPE OF ACTION DURING ITS STRUGGLE AGAINST THE DICTATOR ANASTASIO SOMOZA, WHO WAS OVERTHROWN IN 1979. THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAVE CLAIMED THAT RODRIGUEZ PORTH WAS KILLED BY A FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT COMMANDO TRAINED IN NICARAGUA. HOWEVER, THAT GUERRILLA GROUP HAS DENIED ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACTION. ARCE ALSO DENIED THAT NICARAGUA HAS SENT WEAPONS TO PANAMA WHEN TENSION WITH THE UNITED STATES INCREASED LAST MONTH, AS REPORTED IN THE U.S. MEDIA. I AM NOT SURPRISED BY THOSE STATEMENTS, ARCE SAID, ADDING THAT THE UNITED STATES CONTINUES ITS EFFORTS TO DISCREDIT THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WITH SUCH LIES.
DEV-MUC3-0254	SAN SALVADOR, 17 JUN 89 -- THE UNITED STATES INFORMATION SERVICE HAS REPORTED THAT SALVADORAN LEFTIST LEADERS GUILLERMO UNGO AND RUBEN ZAMORA HAVE ADMITTED THAT THE GUERRILLAS KILLED PRESIDENCY MINISTER ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH; THE GUERRILLAS HAVE DENIED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CRIME. IN A COMMUNIQUE SUMMARIZING THE MEETINGS HELD BY U.S. VICE PRESIDENT DAN QUAYLE DURING HIS VISIT TO EL SALVADOR THIS WEEK, USIS REPORTED THAT THE GUERRILLAS ALSO KILLED ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO. UNGO AND ZAMORA TODAY DENIED THE CHARGES, CALLING THEM "TOTALLY FALSE." THEY CHALLENGED USIS TO TAKE BACK OR TO CLARIFY ITS STATEMENT PUBLISHED IN THE MORNING CONSERVATIVE DAILY EL DIARIO DE HOY. A SPOKESMAN REPRESENTING UNGO TOLD ACAN - EFE THAT "THE PUBLICATION OF THAT STATEMENT IS A PUBLICITY STUNT TO IMPLICATE US IN RODRIGUEZ PORTH'S ASSASSINATION. WE DENY THE CHARGES PUBLISHED TODAY, AND WE DEMAND A CLARIFICATION FROM USIS."
DEV-MUC3-0255	BOGOTA, 19 JUN 89 -- ACCORDING TO A LAST - MINUTE OFFICIAL REPORT, SIX GUERRILLAS OF THE SO-CALLED CAMILIST UNION OF THE SO-CALLED ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION ELN DIED TODAY DURING FIGHTING WITH BATTALION TROOPS IN THE SLOPES OF THE PERIJA MOUNTAIN RANGE. A MILITARY COMMAND SPOKESMAN SAID THAT THE FIGHTING TOOK PLACE A SCANT 10 KM FROM THE VILLAGE OF SAN JACINTO IN SAN DIEGO MUNICIPALITY, WHERE FOUR SOLDIERS DIED LAST WEEK IN AN AMBUSH. POLICE AND MILITARY FORCES HAVE STEPPED UP SURVEILLANCE AROUND THE CANO LIMON - COVENAS PIPELINE AFTER TWO NEW ATTACKS, ALSO BY THE ELN, OCCURRED IN HUILA AND NORTH SANTANDER DEPARTMENTS. THE TERRORIST ATTACK IN HUILA DEPARTMENT TOOK PLACE IN LA MOTOSA, NEAR AIPE MUNICIPALITY, WHERE THE PIPELINE THAT PUMPS CRUDE OIL BETWEEN NEIVA AND LA DORADA WAS DYNAMITED. HUMBERTO BRINES TRAVELED EARLY TODAY TO THE SCENE OF THE EVENTS AND REPORTED THE FOLLOWING: A NEW ATTACK WAS PERPETRATED LAST NIGHT AGAINST THE PIPELINE THAT PUMPS CRUDE OIL FROM NEIVA TO DORADA. SUSPECTED ELN GUERRILLAS PLACED A DYNAMITE CHARGE AT THE PLACE CALLED LA MOTOSA, NEAR AIPE MUNICIPALITY, WHICH COMPLETELY DESTROYED THE GUARD POST AND A STRETCH OF THE PIPELINE. A FIRE IMMEDIATELY BROKE OUT AND THE INSTALLATION WAS COMPLETELY GUTTED. CRUDE OIL PUMPING WAS SUSPENDED AND EFFORTS TO CONTAIN THE FIRE AND TO REPAIR THE PIPELINE BEGAN AT 2300. THE EXTENT OF THE LOSSES HAS NOT YET BEEN ASSESSED. THIS PIPELINE PUMPS 58,000 BARRELS OF OIL PER DAY. THE MAIN PUMPING STATION IS LOCATED IN AIPE MUNICIPALITY. WORKERS FROM AND ECOPETROL WORKED INTENSELY ALL THROUGH THE PREDAWN HOURS TO REPAIR THE PIPELINE, ENABLING IT TO RESUME PUMPING OPERATIONS AT 1000. EVEN THOUGH THE ELN HAS REPEATEDLY THREATENED THE OIL PIPELINES, WORK HAS CONTINUED ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW MULTIPLE PIPELINE IN HUILA, WHICH WILL PUMP 138,000 BARRELS OF OIL PER DAY BETWEEN NEIVA AND COVENAS. THE SAME PIPELINE WAS BLOWN UP ONLY 1 MONTH AGO, A SCARCE 25 KM FROM THAT PLACE.
DEV-MUC3-0256	BOGOTA, 20 JUN 89 -- THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE LATEST TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S OIL PIPELINE HAS SO FAR BEEN ESTIMATED AT ALMOST 75 BILLION PESOS. ACCORDING TO ECOPETROL , THERE HAVE BEEN FOUR DYNAMITE ATTACKS ON THE PIPELINE IN THE LAST 72 HOURS. BECAUSE OF THE ATTACKS, COLOMBIA WILL HAVE TO ABSTAIN FROM MARKETING CRUDE OIL ABROAD FOR 3 WEEKS, THUS LOSING $150 MILLION. THE DAMAGE CAUSED TO THE COVENAS PLANT AMOUNTS TO $7 MILLION; ANOTHER $7 MILLION WILL HAVE TO BE SPENT ON REPAIRS. ECOPETROL PRESIDENT ANDRES RESTREPO LONDONO SAID THAT THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE WILL FEEL THE IMPACT OF THESE ATTACKS. ALREADY THE ROYALTIES GIVEN TO THE MUNICIPALITIES HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED, AND AN INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES WILL BE NECESSARY, ACCORDING TO THE FIRST SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COUNTRY'S PETROLEUM ENTERPRISE AUTHORITIES. MEANWHILE, THE ARMY HAS INCREASED ITS COUNTEROFFENSIVE AGAINST ELN GUERRILLAS, WHICH HAVE CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACKS ON THE OIL PIPELINE, EXERTING PRESSURE TO MODIFY THE OIL POLICY. THE LATEST ATTACK ON THE PIPELINE OCCURRED AT THE LISAMA INSTALLATIONS, LOCATED BETWEEN BARRANCABERMEJA AND BUCARAMANGA. ELN GUERRILLAS ATTACKED THESE INSTALLLATIONS, WHICH ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PRODUCING GAS AND PETROLEUM. THE GUERRILLAS CUT 80 PERCENT OF THE CABLES ATTACHED TO THE MOTORS WHICH EXTRACT FUEL. A DYNAMITE CHARGE WAS ALSO PLACED ON THE PIPELINE AT KM-28 IN CANO LIMON-COVENAS, IN THE AREA OF CARMEN, NEAR THE TONCHALA RIVER, IN NORTHERN SANTANDER. NO FUEL, HOWEVER, WAS LOST. THE ATTACKS HAVE NOW EXTENDED TO HUILA DEPARTMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME, DAMAGING FUEL INSTALLATIONS. HERE THE OIL SPILL WAS STOPPED BY CLOSING DOWN THE INSTALLATIONS. FURTHERMORE, NINE GUERRILLAS HAVE BEEN KILLED, EIGHT MORE HAVE BEEN CAPTURED, AND AN ELN TRAINING CENTER HAS BEEN DISMANTLED. THIS IS THE RESULT OF THE ARMY'S FIRST COUNTERINSURGENCY ACTIONS AGAINST THOSE DETERMINED TO DO AWAY WITH THE NATION'S RESOURCES BY ATTACKING THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS PIPELINE. MILITARY AUTHORITIES HAVE REPORTED THAT NEAR SERRANIA DE PERIJA, CESAR DEPARTMENT, THE 2D BRIGADE'S BATTALION TROOPS CLASHED WITH ELN GUERRILLAS. THE CLASH RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF SIX GUERRILLAS AND THE CONFISCATION OF A GREAT AMOUNT OF WAR MATERIEL. IN ADDITION, THE ARMY DISMANTLED AN ELN URBAN NETWORK, CAPTURING EIGHT OF ITS MEMBERS. MEANWHILE, THE 14TH BRIGADE'S BATTALION TROOPS KILLED JOSE ANTONIO VELASCO, A FARC LEADER. FINALLY, 5TH BRIGADE TROOPS ARE CONTINUING THEIR ACTIONS IN THE CACATUMBO AREA, WHERE THE ELN HAS TAKEN REFUGE. THE ELN, COMMANDED BY SPANISH PRIEST MANUEL PEREZ, HAS BASED ITS OPERATIONS IN EASTERN COLOMBIA.
DEV-MUC3-0257	BOGOTA, 21 JUN 89 -- THE COLOMBIAN ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION ANNOUNCED TODAY FOR THE FIRST THAT THAT IT IS WILLING TO ENGAGE IN A DIALOGUE ON THE COUNTRY'S OIL POLICY. THE ELN HAS CARRIED OUT A DESTRUCTIVE WAVE OF ATTACKS AGAINST THE COLOMBIAN OIL INDUSTRY TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO NATIONALIZE THIS INDUSTRY. THE GUERRILLA GROUP'S WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN A DIALOGUE IS CONVEYED IN A TAPE SENT TO CONSERVATIVE SENATOR ALVARO LEYVA FROM FORMER SPANISH PRIEST MANUEL PEREZ, WHO IS THE ELN'S FOUNDER AND LEADER. ACCORDING TO LEYVA, PEREZ EXPRESSED HIS WILLINGNESS TO MEET WITH HIM TO EXPLAIN THE GUERRILLA GROUP'S IDEAS ON WHAT COLOMBIA'S OIL POLICY SHOULD BE. LEYVA SAID THAT THE ELN ALSO DEMANDED THAT NATIONALIZATION BE APPLIED TO OTHER NATURAL RESOURCES. FURTHERMORE, THE ELN -- WHICH HAS PREVIOUSLY REJECTED THE GOVERNMENT'S PEACE OFFER -- REITERATED ITS DESIRE TO "HUMANIZE" THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND THE ARMY, SO THAT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION WILL NOT BE AFFECTED. LEYVA HAS PLAYED A LEADING ROLE IN SEEKING A RAPPROCHEMENT BETWEEN GUERRILLA GROUPS AND THE GOVERNMENT. TO THIS END HE HAS MET SEVERAL TIMES WITH M-19 AND REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA COMMANDERS, WHICH IS WHY THE ELN SELECTED HIM AS THE BEARER OF ITS MESSAGE. THE ELN HAS CONCENTRATED ITS TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S MAIN OIL PIPELINE, WHICH EXTENDS 800 KM FROM THE EASTERN TO THE NORTHWESTERN REGIONS OF COLOMBIA. IT HAS CAUSED MILLIONS IN LOSSES TO THE STATE COLOMBIAN PETROLEUM ENTERPRISE AND SERIOUS ECOLOGICAL DAMAGE RESULTING FROM OIL SPILLS. IN 1988, IT ATTACKED THE NATION'S PIPELINES APPROXIMATELY 50 TIMES, AND THUS FAR THIS YEAR THE ELN HAS CARRIED OUT 21 ATTACKS. ON 16 JUNE, THE MAIN OIL RESERVES IN THE CARIBBEAN PORT CITY OF COVENAS WERE VIRTUALLY DESTROYED BY SEVERAL DYNAMITE BLASTS SET OFF BY THE GUERRILLAS. THIS WAS THE ELN'S MOST DARING AND SERIOUS ATTACK TO DATE. THE ELN CLAIMS THAT THE MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES THAT CARRY OUT OIL EXPLORATION AND DRILLING WITH ECOPETROL ARE "PLUNDERING" COLOMBIA'S NATURAL RESOURCES.

A SPOKESMAN FOR THE HOSPITAL TO WHICH THE NUN WAS TAKEN AFTER BEING WOUNDED ALONG WITH TWO OTHER NUNS ON 21 JUNE, SAID: "THE NUN UNDERWENT SURGERY TWICE AND SHE WILL MOST LIKELY LOSE HER LEFT EYE, BUT SHE IS OUT OF DANGER." THE TWO OTHER WOUNDED NUNS ARE U.S. CITIZEN SISTER ANA MARIA BRANGAN AND SALVADORAN SISTER JUANA MARGARITA FLORES. CHURCH SOURCES HAVE SAID THAT MACKEY IS NOT A U.S. CITIZEN, BUT AN IRISH CITIZEN WHO WAS SENT TO WORK IN EL SALVADOR IN 1983 SPONSORED BY THE ARCHDIOCESE OF CLEVELAND .

DEV-MUC3-0261	CLANDESTINE, 23 JUN 89 -- CONCERNING THE TERRORIST ATTACK ON FRIDAY, 23 JUNE AT THE SAN SALVADOR CENTRAL MARKET IN WHICH 2 PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND 30 WOUNDED, THE FMLN REPORTS TO ALL SALVADORANS THE FOLLOWING: 1. THAT THE HURLING OF THE BOMB AT THE CENTRAL MARKET WAS A TERRORIST ACTION BY THE ARENA GOVERNMENT, SPECIFICALLY BY THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND. THIS ACTION IS PART OF A COLD-BLOODED PLAN THAT CONSISTS OF CRIMINAL ACTIONS IN PUBLIC PLACES DESIGNED TO TURN PEOPLE AGAINST THE FMLN. 2. WE HOLD COLONEL MAURICIO GUZMAN AGUILAR -- WHO ACQUIRED EXPERIENCE IN THIS KIND OF CRIMINAL ACTION WHEN HE COMMANDED THE 5TH BRIGADE -- RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS TREACHEROUS TERRORIST ACTION.

DEV-MUC3-0262	MANAGUA , 25 JUN 89 -- NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA HAS WARNED THAT THE UNITED STATES IS PRESSURING THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA TO INCREASE ITS "AGGRESSIVE" ACTIONS AGAINST THE SANDINISTS. DURING A MEETING WITH INDUSTRIALISTS IN MASAYA, 35 KM SOUTH OF MANAGUA, ORTEGA SOUNDED IRRITATED IN LIGHT OF THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT'S THREATS TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA. ON SATURDAY, THE HONDURAN FOREIGN MINISTRY ISSUED A NOTE TO PROTEST STATEMENTS BY NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER MIGUEL D' ESCOTO AGAINST HONDURAN PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA, WHOM D' ESCOTO ACCUSED OF HAVING IMPLEMENTED A "NARCOSTATE". ORTEGA SAID: "WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY HONDURAS FEELS OFFENDED WHEN WE ARE THE ONES WHO WERE OFFENDED, NOT THEM." "WE COULD HAVE BROKEN RELATIONS WITH THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT A LONG TIME AGO, FROM THE MOMENT HONDURAS WAS FIRST USED AS A SPRINGBOARD TO ATTACK NICARAGUA," THE SANDINIST LEADER STRESSED. THE HONDURAN FOREIGN MINISTRY YESTERDAY WARNED, IN A VEILED MANNER, THAT NICARAGUA BECAUSE OF WHAT IT DESCRIBED AS " D' ESCOTO'S DIRTY REMARKS."' HONDURAS "HAS REACTED WITH JUSTIFIED INDIGNATION, TO THE POINT OF REQUESTING A BREAK IN RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA," THE HONDURAN FOREIGN MINISTRY ADDED. D' ESCOTO, WHO IS CURRENTLY IN VENEZUELA, CRITICIZED HONDURAS' POLICY AND SAID THAT HONDURAS IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE COUNTRY TO HOLD THE NEXT CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT. THE HEAD OF NICARAGUA SAID THAT THE HONDURAN AUTHORITIES "HAVE OFFENDED THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE WITH THEIR WORDS AND ACTIONS, AND THEY HAVE SERVED AS A SPRINGBOARD FOR THE MURDER OF CHILDREN AND THE MUTILATION OF THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE." ORTEGA ALSO CRITICIZED U.S. VICE PRESIDENT DAN QUAYLE'S VISIT TO TEGUCIGALPA AND SAID THAT THOSE MEETINGS IN WHICH NICARAGUA WAS ATTACKED "MUST BE DENOUNCED."

APPROXIMATELY 18,000 BARRELS OF GASOLINE ARE PUMPED THROUGH THIS SECTION OF THE PIPELINE DAILY. PUMPING HAS BEEN HALTED WHILE THE PIPELINE IS REPAIRED. ALTHOUGH THE EXACT AMOUNT OF THE DAMAGE IS STILL UNKNOWN, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT LOSSES FROM THE SPILLED GASOLINE AND THE DAMAGE TO THE PIPELINE ARE CLOSE TO 20 MILLION PESOS. THIS IS THE FIFTH DYNAMITE ATTACK ON THE PACIFIC PIPELINE BY THE ELN IN VALLE DEL CAUCA DEPARTMENT IN THE PAST 6 MONTHS. ONE OCCURRED IN BUGA MUNICIPALITY 1 MONTH AGO, AND THE OTHER FOUR HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE MULALO AREA.

SOLORZANO CALLED TOGETHER A GROUP OF NEWSMEN IN THE CITY OF SAN PEDRO SULA, IN NORTHERN HONDURAS, AND TURNED HIMSELF OVER TO THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES IN THE REPORTERS' PRESENCE. THE OFFICER DECLINED TO GIVE DETAILS ABOUT "DELICATE MATTERS" ABOUT WHICH HE WILL BRIEF THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES. HE SAID THEY CONCERN HIS ACTIVITIES IN THIS COUNTRY SINCE MAY. THE DEFECTOR SAID HE ARRIVED IN HONDURAS IN AUGUST 1988 WITH AN IDENTIFICATION CARD FROM THE HONDURAN NATIONAL REGISTRY OF PERSONS IDENTIFYING HIM AS A HONDURAN FROM COMAYAGUA, IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY. HE TOLD THE PRESS HE HAS BEEN A SANDINIST SINCE 1974 AND HAD BEEN AN URBAN GUERRILLA LEADER DURING THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE SOMOZIST REGIME IN NICARAGUA. HE SAID THE DE FACTO GOVERNMENT AND THE CONTINUED RETENTION OF POWER BY THE SANDINISTS FORCED HIM TO DEFECT. HE ADDED THAT GROUPS OF SANDINISTS HAVE BEEN INFILTRATED INTO TEGUCIGALPA, SAN PEDRO SULA, AND OTHER PARTS OF HONDURAS TO CAUSE SOCIAL DESTABILIZATION. HE EXPLAINED THAT AMONG OTHER ACTIVITIES, THEIR MISSION WAS TO KILL LEADERS OF MASS ORGANIZATIONS AND THEN ATTRIBUTE THE DEATHS TO THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES, THEREBY FOMENTING SOCIAL DESTABILIZATION IN THE COUNTRY. HE ADDED THAT HIS CONTACTS WERE OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY AND THAT HE RECEIVED $2,500 A MONTH TO CARRY OUT HIS ACTIVITIES IN HONDURAS. THE DEFECTOR SAID SANDINIST OFFICERS DIRECT THE GUERRILLAS IN EL SALVADOR AND THAT THE ASSASSINATION IN FEBRUARY OF GENERAL GUSTAVO ALVAREZ MARTINEZ, FORMER COMMANDER OF THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES, WAS PLOTTED IN MANAGUA. THE DEFECTOR SAID ALVAREZ HAD ALWAYS BEEN IN THE SANDINISTS' SIGHTS BECAUSE HE WAS THE MAIN PROMOTER OF THE CONTRAS . SOLORZANO SAID NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER MIGUEL D'ESCOTO HAS MANY "DELICATE THINGS" TO SAY AGAINST HONDURAS AND COSTA RICA.
DEV-MUC3-0266	GUATEMALA CITY, 27 JUN 89 -- GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO TODAY REVEALED THERE HAVE BEEN TWO ATTEMPTS TO MURDER HIM SINCE HE ASSUMED THE PRESIDENTCY ON 14 JANUARY 1986. CEREZO, WHO AVOIDED GIVING DETAILS ABOUT THE TWO ATTEMPTS, STATED THAT "THERE IS SPECIFIC INFORMATION" ABOUT AN ALLEGED PLAN TO MURDER HIM. HE ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT NO ONE CAN BE ARRESTED WITHOUT EVIDENCE. CEREZO ASSERTED THAT HE WITHDREW LAST WEEK TO SANTO TOMAS FARM, APPROXIMATELY 43 KM SOUTH OF GUATEMALA CITY, TO THINK, STUDY GUATEMALA'S PROBLEMS, AND REST. CEREZO SAID HE ALSO RETREATED TO HIS FARM TO GIVE HIS SECURITY OFFICIALS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESCHEDULE ACTIVITIES AND CHANGE METHODS TO INCREASE THEIR PROTECTION WITHOUT AFFECTING THE POPULATION OR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE PEOPLE. ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SUMMONING OF FOUR CIVILIANS WHO WERE LINKED WITH ONE OF THE PLANS TO MURDER HIM, CEREZO SAID THEY WERE SUMMONED BY THE POLICE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE ALLEGED PLAN. THE SECOND PLAN WAS REVEALED EARLY THIS MONTH BY HUGO ARCE, A COLUMNIST OF THE GUATEMALAN OPPOSITION NEWSPAPER EL GRAFICO, WHO THE MURDER WAS GOING TO BE CARRIED OUT BY A LIBYAN COMMANDO UNIT THAT HAD ENTERED GUATEMALA IN DECEMBER 1988 AND HAD BEEN TRAINED IN CUBA. CEREZO SAID THAT ARCE MUST TELL EVERYTHING HE KNOWS, BECAUSE OTHERWISE "HE WOULD BE CONCEALING THE PLAN, WHICH IS A CRIME TO DO." OTHER CIVILIANS WHO WILL ALSO BE SUMMONED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE ARE MARIO DAVID GARCIA, NICOLAS BUONAFINA, BOTH SUSPECTED OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE ATTEMPTED COUP OF MAY 1988, AND JUAN MAEGLI.

CEREZO DID NOT PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FIRST ALLEGED PLAN TO MURDER HIM.
DEV-MUC3-0267	LA PAZ, 29 JUN 89 -- BOLIVIAN LABOR CONFEDERATION REPRESENTATIVES REPORTED TODAY THAT THREE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH THE KILLING OF TWO U.S. MORMON MISSIONARIES. THE KILLINGS OCCURRED IN LA PAZ ON 24 MAY. THE KILLING OF THE TWO U.S. MISSIONARIES WAS CLAIMED BY A SELF- STYLED "ZARATE WILLCA ARMED FORCES LIBERATION" GROUP. THIS IS THE SAME GROUP THAT CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK ON GEORGE SHULTZ WHEN HE VISITED LA PAZ IN AUGUST 1988 IN HIS CAPACITY AS U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE. IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, BOLIVIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE ARRESTED DOZENS OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. THEIR RELATIVES AND COB OFFICIALS HAVE CRITICIZED THESE ARRESTS, WHICH THEY CLAIM "ARE AN ILLEGAL AND ARBITRARY ACTION." THE COB LEADERS HAVE REPORTED THAT THOSE ARRESTED HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS CONSTANTINO YUJRA, A SOCIOLOGY STUDENT; TELMA SALAZAR, A NURSING STUDENT; AND ALBERTO MENDOZA, A STUDENT AT THE WARISATA RURAL SCHOOL. MOREOVER, THE SOCIAL SCIENCE SCHOOL OF THE SAN ANDRES UNIVERSITY HAS DECLARED ITSELF IN A "STATE OF EMERGENCY" UNTIL THE STUDENTS ARE RELEASED. THE SCHOOL HAS ALSO CALLED A PROTEST MEETING FOR 30 JUNE. MORMON MISSIONARIES JEFFREY BRENT BALL AND RAY TODD WILSON WERE THE MISSIONARIES KILLED.

DEV-MUC3-0268	LA PAZ, 29 JUN 89 -- DIEGO MORALES, LEADER OF COCHABAMBA'S PEASANT FEDERATION, IS SERIOUSLY INJURED AND IN A COMA. HE IS BEING TREATED AT A CHIMORE HOSPITAL. UMOPAR AGENTS FIRED MACHINEGUNS AT THE AREA FROM HELICOPTERS TO SCARE THE LOCAL POPULATION AFTER COCA PRODUCERS BLOCKED THE ROAD TO STOP AN UMOPAR VEHICLE TO FIRE. HUGO ZALAZAR FROM THE SINGLE TRADE UNION CONFEDERATION OF BOLIVIAN PEASANT WORKERS SAID THAT UMOPAR AGENTS PROTECT DRUG TRAFFICKERS. THE CONFEDERATION WILL CONVENE A NATIONAL EMERGENCY MEETING TO PROTECT COCA GROWERS FROM VIOLENT UMOPAR RAIDS. THE BOLIVIAN LABOR CONFEDERATION CONDEMEND THE RAIDS AND DENIED THAT PEASANTS HAD AMBUSHED THE UMOPAR PATROL. COB LEADER ALEJANDRO GUZMAN REPORTS: I MUST SAY THAT THE REPORT OF AN ALLEGED AMBUSH IS COMPLETELY FALSE. PEASANTS HAVE NOT CAPTURED UMOPAR OR DEA HOSTAGES. THERE WAS, HOWEVER, A VIOLENT ATTACK AGAINST COMPANERO DIEGO MORALES ON HIS LAND, IN FRONT OF OTHER COCA GROWERS. UMOPAR FORCES HAVE ALSO ARRESTED 30 PEASANTS IN PUERTO SAN FRANCISCO, CHAPARE, AFTER A POLICE PATROL WAS FORCED TO RELEASE 2 DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND HAD TO FLEE FROM A CROWD OF NEARLY 1,000 PEASANTS. SOCIAL DEFENSE UNDER SECRETARY GENARO MARQUEZ SAID THE INCIDENT OCCURRED AFTER A MINE-MAN UMOPAR PATROL CAPTURED TWO DRUG TRAFFICKERS. THE PEASANTS INTERCEPTED THE VEHICLE IN WHICH THE TWO DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE BEING TAKEN TO CHIMORE. THE POLICE AGENTS HAD TO RELEASE THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS AFTER THE PEASANTS THREATENED TO SHOOT THEM. THE CROWD CONTINUED TO THREATEN THE PATROL, FORCING THE UMOPAR AGENTS TO FLEE INTO THE WOODS. THE PEASANTS -- SOME 400 STRONG -- BURNED THE UMOPAR PICKUP AND CHASED THE POLICE INTO THE WOODS. UNDER SECRETARY GENARO MARQUEZ EXPLAINTS: YESTERDAY, UMOPAR RAIDED SOME AREAS DURING THE MORNING AND CLASHED WITH A LARGE GROUP OF PEASANTS IN PUERTO SAN FRANCISCO, WHO ATTACKED THE PATROL AFTER LEARNING WHAT HAPPENED TO DIEGO MORALES. THE AGENTS HAD TO RELEASE TWO DRUG TRAFFICKERS THEY WERE BRINGING WITH THEM. THEY WERE ABLE TO FLEE THE AREA AFTER SOME DIFFICULTIES BUT WILL CONTINUE INVESTIGATING. MARQUEZ SAID THE 30 ARRESTED PEASANTS WILL BE QUESTIONED TO DETERMINE THEIR RESPONSIBILITY IN THE INCIDENT AND THOSE WHO ARE INNOCENT WILL BE RELEASED. MARQUEZ ALSO SAID POLICE SEIZED ARMS AND STICKS OF DYNAMITE.
DEV-MUC3-0269	MANAGUA , 28 JUN 89 -- A PROPAGANDISTIC SCANDAL WAS PROMOTED IN HONDURAS YESTERDAY, WITH THE REPORT THAT AN ALLEGED NICARAGUAN SPY, WHO HAD SURRENDERED TO HONDURAN AUTHORITIES, "HAD THE MISSION OF ASSASSINATING PRESIDENT AZCONA, ARCHBISHOP SANTOS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, AND HONDURAN OPPOSITION LEADERS." HONDURAN MEDIA IDENTIFIED THE ALLEGED DEFECTOR AS ORLANDO SOLORZANO MARTINEZ, WHOM THEY CLAIMED WAS TRAINED IN CUBA. REGARDING THIS CASE, IT IS RECALLED THAT AT OTHER TIMES IN HONDURAS, ALLEGED NICARAGUAN MILITARY DEFECTORS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO MAKE CHARGES AGAINST THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT. IN MOST CASES, SUCH CITIZENS DID NOT EXIST UNDER THE NAMES CITED OR SIMPLY WERE NOT CONNECTED WITH THE NICARAGUAN ARMED FORCES. AS IS KNOWN, HONDURAN PRESIDENT AZCONA HOYO'S GOVERNMENT HAS RECENTLY USED THE PRETEXT OF NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER D'ESCOTO'S STATEMENTS IN CARACAS TO THREATEN TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA.
DEV-MUC3-0270	SAN SALVADOR, 1 JUL 89 -- REGARDING THE DEATH OF EDGARD CHACON, TODAY, 30 JUNE, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT STATES THE FOLLOWING: 1. THE FMLN HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DEATH OF EDGARD CHACON. 2. EDGARD CHACON, IDEOLOGIST OF THE ORLANDO DE SOLA GROUP, WAS KILLED AS THE RESULT OF A WAR THAT HAS BEEN UNLEASHED AMONG RIGHTIST GROUPS WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF CIA OPERATIVES. THIS ASSASSINATION WAS A RESPONSE FROM THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI FACTION, WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE CIA, TO THE KILLING OF RODRIGUEZ PORTH, WHOSE ASSASSINATION HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON FACTION. WE URGE THE PEOPLE AND THE MEDIA TO BE ON THE ALERT AND NOT TO BE CONFUSED BY WHAT THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE KILLINGS SAY. FMLN 30 JUNE 1989
DEV-MUC3-0271	SAN SALVADOR, 30 JUN 89 -- SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS BLAMED FMLN GUERRILLAS FOR THE MURDER OF POLITICAL ANALYST EDGAR CHACON AND HAS STRESSED THAT, DESPITE THESE ACTIONS, HE IS UNDETERRED FROM HIS INTENTION TO SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH THE REBELS TO PUT AN END TO THE CONFLICT. PRESIDENT CRISTIANI SAID THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT BE BLACKMAILED BY THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE UNLEASHED BY THE FMLN. THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT THESE ACTIONS ONLY SERVE TO CONFIRM THE WEAKNESS OF THE FMLN, WHICH SEEKS POWER THROUGH VIOLENCE. THE FMLN'S POWERLESSNESS AND INABILITY TO DO BATTLE USING IDEAS RATHER THAN VIOLENCE BECAME EVIDENT AGAIN TODAY. THE FMLN HAS AGAIN TRIED TO SILENCE THE VOICE OF ANOTHER SALVADORAN WHO FOUGHT WITH WORDS AND THOUGHTS. IN EVERY SENSE, THIS HAS BEEN A COWARDLY ACT AND IT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS THAT. IT IS THE WORK OF SICK MINDS. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS WHAT THE FMLN HAS PROVEN TO BE -- A GROUP OF SICK PEOPLE WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE CLAMOR OF A PEOPLE WHO WISH TO TALK RATHER THAN USE VIOLENCE, A PEOPLE WHO WANT PEACE IN EL SALVADOR. WE ARE ON THE SIDE OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WANT US TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN EL SALVADOR. BECAUSE WE WISH TO DO WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT, WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE THE DOORS OPEN IN THE HOPE OF ACHIEVING PEACE IN OUR HOMELAND.
DEV-MUC3-0272	BOGOTA, 2 JUL 89 -- FOUR COLOMBIAN LEFTIST GUERRILLA GROUPS ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO PROMOTE A DIRECT PEACE DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, THIS WILL BRING TO FIVE THE NUMBER OF REBEL GROUPS THAT HAVE REPORTEDLY ACCEPTED THE PEACE PROPOSAL THE COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT MADE IN SEPTEMBER 1988. THE LEFTIST M-19 , WHICH APPEARED IN THE MID-1970'S, KIDNAPPED 20 AMBASSADORS IN AN ATTACK ON THE DOMINICAN EMBASSY IN BOGOTA, AND OCCUPIED THE JUSTICE PALACE IN NOVEMBER 1985 -- AN ACTION THAT RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF 100 PEOPLE -- HAS BEEN HOLDING PEACE TALKS WITH THE BARCO GOVERNMENT SINCE DECEMBER. BOGOTA'S RADIO CADENA NACIONAL REPORTED THAT THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA , THE MARXIST-LENINIST POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY , THE INDIAN QUINTIN LAME COMMANDO UNIT, AND THE REVOLUTIONARY WORKERS PARTY ATTENDED A GUERRILLA SUMMIT HELD IN THE PARAMO DE SUMAPAZ MOUNTAINS, IN SOUTHWEST BOGOTA, THIS WEEKEND. DURING THE GUERRILLA SUMMIT, THE FOURTH SINCE THE CREATION OF THE SIMON BOLIVAR GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD , A DOCUMENT WAS DRAFTED PROPOSING DIRECT DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT. ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENT BROADCAST BY RADIO CADENA NATIONAL, A DIALOGUE, SIMILAR TO THE ONE BEING HELD WITH M-19, "WOULD SERVE TO ESTABLISH THE NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR PEACE AND NATIONAL HARMONY." CONTRARY TO WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED, THE PROPOSAL WAS NOT SENT TO PRESIDENT BARCO, BUT TO MISAEL PASTRANA BORRERO, FORMER OPPOSITION SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE PARTY PRESIDENT WHO RULED FROM 1970 - 1974. PASTRANA IS A MEMBER OF A COMMISSION OF NOTABLES CREATED TO MEDIATE FOR PEACE. THIS COMMISSION SHOULD ANALYZE THE PROPOSAL AND PRESENT IT TO THE GOVERNMENT IN A FEW DAYS. APPARENTLY ALSO PARTICIPATING IN THE SIMON BOLIVAR SUMMIT WERE DELEGATES OF M-19 AND THE ELN, A GROUP THAT HAS UNLEASHED A VIOLENT CAMPAIGN TO DESTROY THE OIL INDUSTRY INFRASTRUCTURE, PARTICULARLY THE LEADING CANO LIMON-COVENAS OIL PIPELINE THAT CROSSES THE COUNTRY EAST TO WEST AND COVERS NEARLY 800 KMS. THE DOCUMENT STRESSES THE NEED TO REACH A PEACEFUL POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE ARMED CONFLICT, WHICH THE COUNTRY HAS HAD TO PUT UP WITH FOR THE PAST 40 YEARS. THE SIGNATORIES OF THE DOCUMENT ASSERTED THAT "DIRECT DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT IS ONE OF THE MECHANISMS THAT COULD LEAD TO A SOLUTION." THE GOVERNMENT MUST CARRY OUT ITS STRUGGLE AGAINST THE SO-CALLED PARAMILITARY GROUPS WITH EVEN MORE DETERMINATION, THE DOCUMENT SAID. THEY ALSO DEMAND AN END TO THE "DIRTY WAR." MEANWHILE, IT WAS LEARNED THAT FORMER PRESIDENT MISAEL PATRANA BORRERO HAS SUMMONED THE NOTABLES COMMISSION, COMPRISED OF FABIO ECHEVERRI CORREA, PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INDUSTRIALISTS AND CARDINAL MARIO REVOLLO CORREA, TO A MEETING ON MONDAY TO REVIEW THE DOCUMENT AND PRESENT IT TO PRESIDENT BARCO. THE PROPOSAL PRESENTED BY THE FARC, THE EPL, THE QUINTIN LAME, AND THE PRT -- ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ABIDING BY THE UNILATERAL TRUCE SINCE EARLY THIS YEAR -- LEAVES THE ELN AS THE ONLY ACTIVE COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA GROUP. HOWEVER, THAT SUBVERSIVE GROUP, LED BY SPANISH PRIEST MANUEL PEREZ, ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK THE POSSIBILITY OF OPENING CHANNELS FOR PEACE IF A DATE IS SET FOR A MEETING, IN THE NEAR FUTURE, TO ANALYZE THE COUNTRY'S CURRENT OIL POLICIES. THE ELN HAS OFFERED TO STOP ITS ATTACKS IF THE OIL INDUSTRY IN THE COUNTRY IS NATIONALIZED.

GUTIERREZ CASTRO REPLACES FRANCISCO JOSE GUERRERO, WHO COMPLETED HIS 5-YEAR TERM. NO ORGANIZATION HAS YET CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK. THE LAST ATTACK WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS OCCURRED IN JUNE, AND THE AUTHORITIES ATTRIBUTED IT TO THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT , BUT THE GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION DENIED THE ACCUSATION. ON THAT OCCASION THREE UNIDENTIFIED MEN SHOT AND KILLED 65-YEAR- OLD PRESIDENCY MINISTER ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH.

THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS HAS BEEN FORCED TO ADOPT MEASURES AGAINST ULTRA RIGHT-WING PARAMILITARY ORGANIZATIONS AND DIFFERENCES ARE BEGINNING TO APPEAR IN THE GOVERNMENT AND IN THE ARMED FORCES. THESE ARGUMENTS ARE TAKING PLACE IN CONNECTION WITH DISCUSSIONS PRIOR TO THE ELECTIONS WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE IN COLOMBIA IN 1990. AFTER THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY HAD DEMANDED FROM THE GOVERNMENT SECURE GUARANTEES THAT IT CAN PARTICIPATE IN THEM, IT ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL BECOME INVOLVED IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS AND NOW IT IS STRIVING TO CREATE A BROAD DEMOCRATIC COALITION. THE APPROACHING ELECTIONS AS WELL AS THE WIDESPREAD INTERNATIONAL CONDEMNATION OF THE "DIRTY WAR" IN COLOMBIA FORCED THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE MORE DECISIVE STEPS IN A NUMBER OF SPHERES. THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE ARE: -- ISSUING PRESIDENTIALLY PROCLAIMED DECREES AGAINST HIRED ASSASSINS AND CREATING AN ELITE MILITARY FORCE FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THEM; ORGANIZING A STRUGGLE AGAINST ULTRA RIGHT-WING PARAMILITARY GROUPS AND INCREASING PRISON SENTENCES UP TO 20-30 YEARS FOR SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS WHO ARE MEMBERS OF THEM; -- CONDUCTING A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE LEFTIST COALITION PATRIOTIC UNION AND THE SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE ARMY WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE MINISTER OF DEFENSE; -- CONDUCTING A PURGE IN THE ARMY DIRECTED AGAINST THE OFFICERS WHO ARE ASSOCIATED WITH WITH GROUPS OF HIRED ASSASSINS. THE REASON FOR ACCELERATING THESE MEASURES WAS THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT AGAINST THE HEAD OF THE SECRET POLICE , GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ, CARRIED OUT ON 30 MAY BY PARAMILITARY GROUPS WHICH ARE CONTROLLED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS. A VEHICLE FILLED WITH 100 KG OF DYNAMITE WAS USED TO TRY TO ASSASSINATE THE HEAD OF STATE SECURITY. THE GENERAL ESCAPED WITHOUT INJURY BUT DURING THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT 7 PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND MORE THAN 50 WERE WOUNDED. BECAUSE OF THIS ACT DIFFERENCES IN THE ARMED FORCES AND IN THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT FURTHER INTENSIFIED. MAZA MARQUEZ HAS BEEN THE SWORN ENEMY OF THE MAFIA AND THE OBJECT OF THEIR THREATS SINCE HE REVEALED THAT THE GANGS WHICH CARRY OUT ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS AGAINST THE CCP AND THE PATRIOTIC UNION ARE TRAINED MERCENARIES FROM THE UNITED STATES, ISRAEL, THE FRG, AND GREAT BRITAIN. AFTER ESCAPING FROM AN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON 3 MAY, GENERAL MAZA MARQUEZ SENT A LETTER TO THE STATE PROSECUTOR. IN IT HE SAID THAT CERTAIN GROUPS IN THE ARMY KNEW ABOUT THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT WHICH HAD BEEN PREPARED AGAINST HIM. DURING THE SAME PERIOD CAPTAIN WANUMEN WAS IMPRISONED; HE HAD SECRET DOCUMENTS FROM THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS, THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, THE U.S. EMBASSY IN BOGOTA, THE DAS, AND THE AMERICAN CIA WHICH LIST HIGHLY PLACED INDIVIDUALS IN THE GOVERNMENT WHO WORK AS "SPIES" FOR THE BENEFIT OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS FROM THE MEDELLIN AND CALI CARTELS. ALTHOUGH PRESIDENT BARCO VARGAS DENIED THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE DOCUMENTS, REPORTS ARE GENERALLY DISSEMINATED THAT THE RULING ELITE HAS BEEN INFILTRATED WITH MAFIA AGENTS. IN THIS SITUATION SPACE OPENS UP FOR THE CCP'S PROPOSAL TO INTRODUCE PEACE TO THE COUNTRY BY WAY OF A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND ALL PARTISAN GROUPS, NOT JUST WITH THE M-19 MOVEMENT, AS THE GOVERNMENT HAS PRACTICED TO DATE. ALTHOUGH THE SITUATION IN COLOMBIA IS STILL SERIOUS, THERE ARE DEFINITE SIGNS OF A TURNAROUND FOR THE BETTER.
DEV-MUC3-0280	MOSCOW , 6 JUL 89 -- THE SOVIET AMBASSADOR TO PERU MADE A REPRESENTATION TO THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF THE COUNTRY IN CONNECTION WITH THE FACT THAT IN THE PERUVIAN PORT OF CALLAO, A BOMB HAD BEEN PLANTED AND DETONATED LAST WEDNESDAY UNDER A BUS CARRYING CREW MEMBERS OF THE TRAWLER SHIPS "KURASOV" AND "LAZURNY", YURIY GREMITSKIKH, FIRST DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY INFORMATION DIRECTORATE, TOLD REPORTERS AT A BRIEFING HERE TODAY. AS A RESULT OF THE TERRORIST ACTION 16 SOVIET SAILORS WERE INJURED. NONE WAS KILLED. ALL THE INJURED SAILORS ARE GETTING MEDICAL ATTENTION. THE SOVIET AMBASSADOR STATED THAT THE SOVIET SIDE EXPECTED THAT THE INCIDENT WOULD BE THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED AND THE CRIMINALS PUNISHED. HE ALSO DEMANDED THAT APPROPRIATE ACTION BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF SOVIET CITIZENS AND OFFICES IN THAT COUNTRY. THE PERUVIAN SIDE EXPRESSED A FEELING OF REGRET CONCERNING THE INCIDENT AND ASSURED THAT ALL NECESSARY STEPS WOULD BE TAKEN TO LOCATE GUILTY PERSONS AND ENSURE THE SAFETY OF SOVIET PEOPLE. THE SOVIET TRAWLER SHIPS WERE IN CALLAO IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTER-GOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE USSR AND PERU ON COOPERATION IN FISHING.
DEV-MUC3-0281	TEGUCIGALPA, 5 JUL 89 -- THE HONDURAN FOREIGN RELATIONS MINISTRY, BASED ON REPORTS FROM AUTHORITIES IN CHARGE OF SECURITY MATTERS RELATED TO THE INTERROGATION OF CAPTAIN ADAN SOLORZANO MARTINEZ -- AN INTELLIGENCE AGENT OF THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT -- INFORMS THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OF THE FOLLOWING: IT IS A KNOWN FACT THAT WITH THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE ARMS RACE BY THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT AND THE USE OF NICARAGUAN TERRITORY AS A POLITICAL AND MILITARY BASE FOR SUBVERSIVE GROUPS, THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES, ASSASSINATIONS, TERRORIST ATTACKS, AND OTHER FORMS OF POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL DESTABILIZATION IN THE REGION. OVER THE PAST 9 YEARS, EL SALVADOR HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY TARGET OF INTERNATIONAL SUBVERSION AND TERRORISM. HONDURAS, HOWEVER, HAS ALSO BEEN AFFECTED BY THESE ACTIONS ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS. WE RECALL THE DEPLORABLE KIDNAPPING OF 100 PERSONS AT THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRIES IN CORTES IN 1982; THE ILLEGAL HIJACKING OF TAN-SAHSA AIRCRAFT BY TERRORIST COMMANDOS WHO ALWAYS ENDED UP SEEKING REFUGE IN MANAGUA OR HAVANA; THE PLANTING OF TWO BOMBS THAT DESTROYED POWER PLANTS IN TEGUCIGALPA, AS WELL AS OTHER TERRORIST ACTS AGAINST HONDURAS BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY; CLANDESTINE ARMS TRAFFICKING, ETC. ON 27-28 JUNE, THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE WERE SHOCKED BY A STATEMENT MADE IN SAN PEDRO SULA BY A NICARAGUAN CITIZEN WHO, ACCORDING TO HIS STATEMENTS, IS AN ARMY CAPTAIN AND INTELLIGENCE AGENT FOR THE SANDINIST REGIME. HE DISCLOSED THAT, IN AUGUST 1988, HE WAS ASSIGNED THE MISSIONS OF PLANNING THE ASSASSINATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND THE BEHEADING OF THE HONDURAN SPIRITUAL AND POLITICAL LEADERSHIP THROUGH THE PHYSICAL ELIMINATION OF HONDURAN ARCHBISHOP MSGR HECTOR ENRIQUE SANTOS AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES CARLOS ROBERTO FLORES AND RAFAEL LEONARDO CALLEJAS ROMERO, OF THE LIBERAL AND NATIONAL PARTIES RESPECTIVELY. THE SANDINIST FOREIGN MINISTRY RESPONDED TO THESE REPORTS BY ISSUING A 29 JULY 1989 COMMUNIQUE, IN WHICH IT OPENLY ADMITTED THAT NICARAGUAN CITIZEN ORLANDO ADAN SOLORZANO MARTINEZ WAS AN ARMY LIEUTENANT -- NOT A CAPTAIN -- AND THAT HE HAD WORKED FOR THE NICARAGUAN INTERIOR MINISTRY FOR 7 AND 1/2 YEARS, FROM 20 AUGUST 1979 TO 28 JANUARY 1987. THE COMMUNIQUE ADDED THAT ON 28 JANUARY 1987, SOLORZANO HAD BEEN FIRED AND THAT HIS RECORD SHOWED A LONG LIST OF DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS. THIS EXPLANATION VERY CONVENIENTLY ALLOWS NICARAGUA TO DISASSOCIATE ITSELF FROM THE ESPIONAGE AND TERRORIST ACTIVITIES OF ITS INTELLIGENCE AGENT IN THE EVENT HE WAS CAUGHT OR DESERTED. UNDOUBTEDLY, THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT, BECAUSE OF ITS IDEOLOGY AND BECAUSE IT HAS CLOSE TIES TO THE FINANCING AND TRAINING -- BOTH POLITICALLY AND MILITARILY -- OF CENTRAL AMERICAN TERRRORIST GROUPS, HAS BEEN DIRECTLY INVOLVED AT VARIOUS LEVELS IN THESE GROUPS' CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES, WHICH VIOLATE INTERNATIONAL NORMS ON PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE AND HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS SITUATION HAS GIVEN RISE TO THE DIFFERENT PEACE EFFORTS THAT HAVE SPRUNG UP IN THE REGION TO ATTEMPT TO PUT AN END TO THESE ACTIONS. THE HONDURAN SECURITY AUTHORITIES HAVE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME ABOUT ESPIONAGE ACTIVITIES AGAINST HONDURAS AND THE LINKS BETWEEN NICARAGUAN EMBASSY PERSONNEL IN TEGUCIGALPA AND HONDURAN REBEL GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN SPECIAL CAMPS IN NICARAGUA AND OTHER TOTALITARIAN COUNTRIES.
DEV-MUC3-0282	NO CITY , 08 JUL 89 -- OUR MOST PROMISING FUTURE DOES NOT DEPEND ON WHAT WILL HAPPEN, BUT ON WHAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO BUILD TOGETHER, ALL UNITED. THIS IS THE CHALLENGE WE ARGENTINES ARE FACING -- THE CHALLENGE OF BEING ABLE TO TRANSFORM THIS CRISIS INTO A FERTILE SCENARIO. THIS IS THE TIME FOR REFLECTION AND IMAGINATION. THIS IS THE TIME FOR IDEAS, AS WELL AS FOR CREATIVITY AND BOLDNESS. THIS IS THE TIME TO ELIMINATE WHAT IS DECREPIT AND WELCOME WHAT IS BEGINNING. THIS IS THE TIME FOR CREATIVE BOLDNESS, INNOVATION, AND COURAGE. THE ARGENTINE PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN THE PATH OF DEMOCRACY WITH A SOCIAL ACCENT. THE ARGENTINE PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN LIBERTY AND JUSTICE, PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT. THE ARGENTINE PEOPLE HAVE OPTED TO TRANSFORM OUR DECADENCE, TO OVERCOME OUR PETTY DISAGREEMENTS, AND TO MOUNT A COLLECTIVE EFFORT. THE ARGENTINE PEOPLE HAVE VOTED FOR THE EPIC OF NATIONAL UNITY. THEREFORE, OURS IS A GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY. IN OUR OPINION, NATIONAL UNITY IS NOT STRENGTHENED BY HEGEMONIC PROJECTS, PATERNAL ATTITUDES, PASSIONATE FITS, OR FLEETING EMOTIONS. GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, AND FOR THE PEOPLE CANNOT DEPEND ON THE MANDATE OF A SINGLE MAN, THE WHIM OF A PARTY, OR THE IMPOSITION OF A SECTOR. APPLAUSE THE GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY IS THE PROPERTY OF ALL ARGENTINES. NO ONE CAN FEEL UNINTERESTED. NO ONE CAN FEEL UNINVITED. IF ARGENTINA IS NOT OCCUPYING ITS PROPER PLACE, IT IS NOT THE COUNTRY'S BUT ALL ARGENTINES RESPONSIBILITY. IT SHOULD BE BLAMED ON OUR DIVISIONS, HISTORIC BURDENS, IDEOLOGICAL PREJUDICES, AND SECTARIANISMS. WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FORMULATE AN HONEST BALANCE OF OUR COUNTRY'S VICTORIES AND FAILURES, ITS WEAK AND STRONG POINTS, AND ITS MISTAKES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS. THIS IS THE FIRST LESSON WE HAVE ALREADY LEARNED TOGETHER BECAUSE THE TIME OF THE WORST UNDERDEVELOPMENT, THE UNDERDEVELOPMENT OF CONSIDERING THOSE WHO THINK DIFFERENTLY AN ENEMY, HAS ENDED IN THIS COUNTRY. APPLAUSE THANK GOD, THE COUNTRY WHERE THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE PREVAILED HAS ENDED. THE EXISTENCE OF BOTH AN OFFICIAL COUNTRY AND A SUBMERGED COUNTRY HAS ENDED. THE EXISTENCE OF BOTH A VISIBLE COUNTRY AND A REAL COUNTRY HAS ENDED. I HAVE COME TO UNITE THOSE TWO ARGENTINAS. I HAVE COME TO STRUGGLE FOR THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE TWO FATHERLANDS. I DO NOT WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF A FACTION, A GROUP, A SECTOR, OR A POLITICAL EXPRESSION. I DO NOT WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF YET ANOTHER FRUSTRATION. I WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF A UNITED ARGENTINA THAT PROGRESSES DESPITE DISSENT. I WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE ARGENTINA OF ROSAS AND SARMIENTO , THE ARGENTINA OF MITRE AND FACUNDO QUIROGA, , THE ARGENTINA OF ANGEL VICENTE PENALOZA AND JUAN BAUTISTA ALBERDI , THE ARGENTINA OF PELLEGRINI AND YRIGOYEN , AND THE ARGENTINA OF PERON AND BALBIN
DEV-MUC3-0283	BOGOTA, 9 JUL 89 -- THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY ELN HAS PROMISED TO RELEASE NORWEGIAN ANTHROPOLOGIST BRUCE OLSON WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. THE ELN HAD KIDNAPPED AND SENTENCED OLSON TO DEATH. ELN MILITARY COMMANDER NICOLAS RODRIGUEZ ANNOUNCED THIS DECISION TO REPORTERS FROM THE SPANISH NEWS AGENCY EFE. OLSON, A PHILOSOPHER AND ANTHROPOLOGIST, ARRIVED IN COLOMBIA 30 YEARS AGO AND WAS WORKING WITH THE MOTILONES INDIANS IN THE CATATUMBO JUNGLE AT THE TIME OF HIS CAPTURE. HE HAD BUILT 14 SCHOOLS AND SEVERAL HEALTH CENTERS IN THE AREA. HE HAD ALSO WRITTEN SEVERAL BOOKS ON THE MOTILO INDIAN LANGUAGE. THE ELN, HOWEVER, ACCUSED HIM OF BEING A CIA AGENT AND AN EXPLOITER OF THE INDIAN PEOPLE. THE ELN KIDNAPPED OLSON, DECLARED HIM A PRISONER OF WAR, AND SENTENCED HIM TO DEATH. HOWEVER, THIS NIGHTMARE IS NOW OVER. THE ELN HAS PROMISED TO TURN OLSON OVER SAFE AND SOUND TO THE RED CROSS IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. IN ADDITION, THE ELN SENT A LETTER TO PRESIDENT BARCO. PARLIAMENTARIANS GUILLERMO ALBERTO GONZALEZ AND ORLANDO GOMEZ WILL DELIVER THE LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT TOMORROW. IN THIS LETTER, THE ELN LISTS ITS DEMANDS, WHICH, IF MET, WOULD LEAD THEM TO HALT THE BLOWING UP OF OIL PIPELINES. ACCORDING TO GONZALEZ, THE GUERRILLA GROUP DEMANDS THE DISMISSAL OF MINES MINISTER OSCAR MEJIA AND ECOPETROL PRESIDENT ANDRES RESTREPO. THE ELN ALSO CONDITIONED THEIR SUSPENSION OF ATTACKS AGAINST THE PIPELINES ON THE CREATION OF A NATIONAL PETROLEUM COUNCIL AND A FORUM FOR A DEBATE TO REVIEW THE CURRENT OIL POLICY. MY IMPRESSION DURING MY 2 DAYS OF CAPTIVITY IS THAT THEY ATTACH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO A DEBATE ON THE NATION'S OIL POLICY. THEY DEMAND THAT THIS DEBATE BE CARRIED OUT THROUGH A COUNCIL MEETING, WHICH WOULD INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE GOVERNMENT, LABOR UNIONS -- PARTICULARLY THE AND ECOPETROL UNIONS -- AS WELL AS SEVERAL PROMINENT FIGURES WHOM THEY LISTED IN THE LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT. GONZALEZ ADDED THAT HE AGREES WITH COMPTROLLER RODOLFO GONZALEZ THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD TALK WITH THE ELN, A GUERRILLA GROUP WHICH IN THE PAST HAS BEEN THE MOST UNWILLING TO JOIN THE PEACE PROCESS. IF THE DIALOGUE RESULTS IN A SOLUTION TO COLOMBIA'S PUBLIC UNREST, THEN WE MUST NOT AVOID THE DIALOGUE; WE MUST HOLD IT.
DEV-MUC3-0284	BOGOTA, 10 JUL 89 -- THE MAYORS OF COCORNA, SAN CARLOS, AND SAN FRANCISCO WERE RELEASED IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF SAN FRANCISCO, ANTIOQUIA, THIS MORNING. THEY WERE KIDNAPPED LAST SATURDAY BY THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION . OUR REPORTER LAYS VARGAS HAS MORE ON THIS: THE MAYORS OF COCORNA, SAN CARLOS, AND SAN FRANCISCO WERE RELEASED AT 0430 THIS MORNING ON SAN LORENZO AVENUE OF COCORNA MUNICIPALITY. THEY HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED THIS PAST WEEKEND BY THE ELN. THE PURPOSE OF THE KIDNAPPING WAS TO PUBLICIZE, THROUGH THE MAYORS, A COMMUNIQUE IN WHICH THE REBEL GROUP ANNOUNCES ITS CAMPAIGN WAR FOR LIFE, COMES OUT AGAINST THE DIRTY WAR, AND MAKES A NEW CALL FOR A NATIONAL OIL FORUM FOR VARIOUS POLITICAL AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS TO DISCUSS THE STATUS OF THIS VITAL PRODUCT OF OUR ECONOMY. THE ELN HOPES TO PRESENT THROUGH THIS FORUM ITS VIEWS ON OIL POLICY. THEY ASSURED US THAT NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN TO US, THAT EVERYTHING WOULD BE ALL RIGHT BECAUSE THIS WAS ONLY PART OF A CAMPAIGN THEY ARE WAGING CALLED THE WAR FOR LIFE. THEY KIDNAPPED ME AND TOOK ME TO THEIR CAMP. WHAT IS IN THE COMMUNIQUE, MAYOR? THE COMMUNIQUE IS BEING HELD BY THE MAYOR OF SAN CARLOS. IN ANY EVENT, WE WANT TO SPEAK TO THE GOVERNMENT SECRETARY TOMORROW OR THIS AFTERNOON TO GIVE HIM THE COMMUNIQUE. WE DO NOT KNOW WHEN IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO SPEAK TO HIM. IN THE COMING HOURS, THE MAYORS OF COCORNA, SAN FRANCISCO, AND SAN CARLOS WILL TRAVEL TO MEDELLIN TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT SECRETARY. TOMORROW THEY PLAN TO HOLD A NEWS CONFERENCE DURING WHICH THEY WILL PRESENT THE COMMUNIQUE GIVEN TO THEM BY THE ELN.
DEV-MUC3-0285	MOSCOW , 9 JUL 89 -- AS IZVESTIYA HAS ALREADY REPORTED, ON 5 JULY AT 1000 HOURS LOCAL TIME, A BUS WITH SOVIET SEAMEN ON BOARD WAS BLOWN UP BY A BOMB. AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION 20 PEOPLE WERE INJURED, OF WHOM 17 WERE HOSPITALIZED, 3 OF THEM IN A SERIOUS CONDITION. OUR MEXICO CITY CORRESPONDENT A. CHEREPANOV CALLED EMBASSY AND MINISTRY OF THE FISHING INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES IN LIMA. HERE ARE THE ADDITIONAL DETAILS HE MANAGED TO OBTAIN. ON THE MORNING OF 5 JULY A GROUP OF 52 PEOPLE IN TWO BUSES VISITED THE "ALBATROS" STORE, AS IS THE CUSTOM AMONG OFF-DUTY CREWS FROM SOVIET FISHING VESSELS WORKING IN PERUVIAN COASTAL WATERS. THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED ON ONE OF THE BUSES AS IT WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE. FORTUNATELY, THE BOMB WAS HOMEMADE AND NOT THAT POWERFUL. AND IT HAD OBVIOUSLY BEEN HASTILY PLANTED . THE PASSENGERS WERE INJURED MAINLY BY PIECES OF BROKEN GLASS. THE POLICE AND EMERGENCY SERVICES WERE ON THE SCENE IMMEDIATELY. NEARLY ALL THE CASUALTIES WERE IMMEDIATELY HOSPITALIZED. IT IS TRUE THAT AT FIRST THERE WAS A MIXUP IN THE HOSPITAL OVER RUSSIAN NAMES -- IT TOOK THE DOCTORS A WHILE TO WORK OUT WHICH PHOTOGRAPH BELONGED TO WHOM. REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SOVIET EMBASSY AND CONSULATE CAME TO THEIR AID. ON THE SAME DAY SKILLED OPERATIONS WERE CARRIED OUT ON ALL THOSE WHO REQUIRED THEM. THE IZVESTIYA CORRESPONDENT WAS OFFICIALLY INFORMED THAT THE SERIOUSLY INJURED SOVIET SEAMEN WERE OUT OF DANGER. THEIR FAMILIES HAD BEEN INFORMED. THE PERUVIAN PRESS BELIEVES THAT THE TERRORIST ACT CARRIED OUT AGAINST SOVIET CITIZENS WAS THE WORK OF THE MAOIST-INCLINED LEFTIST ARMED GROUPING "SENDERO LUMINOSO." BUT THERE IS ANOTHER VERSION: IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT BY ULTRARIGHTISTS OPPOSING THE FISHING AGREEMENTS SIGNED BETWEEN PERU AND THE USSR.
DEV-MUC3-0286	MOSCOW , 7 JUL 89 -- THIRTYTHREE SOVIET SEAMEN HAVE BEEN INJURED IN THE PERUVIAN PORT OF CALLAO AS A RESULT OF AN EXPLOSION CAUSED BY A BOMB PLANTED UNDER A BUS STANDING IN THE STREET. OUR CORRESPONDENT TELEPHONED THE USSR MINISTRY OF THE FISH INDUSTRY AND ASKED FOR INFORMATION ON THE INCIDENT. "IT HAPPENED ON 5 JULY AT 1010 HOURS LOCAL TIME," S. SVINARENKO, DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE USSR MINISTRY OF THE FISH INDUSTRY FOREIGN RELATIONS ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT, SAID. "SIXTEEN SEAMEN HAD TO BE HOSPITALIZED. FORTUNATELY, NO ONE WAS SERIOUSLY HURT. THE SEAMEN MAINLY SUFFERED FRACTURES, CUTS, AND BURNS. THE VICTIMS WERE MEMBERS OF THE CREWS OF TWO LARGE, AUTONOMOUS TRAWLERS -- THE 'VLADIMIR KURASOV' AND THE 'LAZURNYY' -- WHO WERE ON SHORE LEAVE THAT DAY. "OUR SEAMEN ARE WORKING IN THIS REGION ON THE BASIS OF AN AGREEMENT ON COOPERATION BETWEEN PERU AND THE SOVIET UNION. WE ASSIST THE PERUVIANS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR FISHING INDUSTRY, GET OUR SHIPS REPAIRED IN LOCAL PORTS, AND FISH WITHIN A 200-MILE ZONE OF THAT COUNTRY...." REUTER AND AFP HAVE REPORTED THAT, IN THE OPINION OF THE CALLAO POLICE, THE EXPLOSION WAS ORGANIZED BY THE "SENDERO LUMINOSO," A REBEL GROUP OF MAOIST PERSUASION. "THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT THAT THIS ACT, WHICH DESERVES TO BE CONDEMNED, WAS DIRECTED AGAINST TOTALLY INNOCENT CITIZENS," PERUVIAN FOREIGN MINISTER GUILLERMO LARCO COX SAID. THE SOVIET SEAMEN WERE ON A BUS WHICH HAD STOPPED AT A STORE WHEN THE BOMB, PLANTED UNDER AN EMPTY BUS STANDING NEARBY, WAS DETONATED. ACCORDING TO EYE WITNESSES, FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WEARING SCHOOL UNIFORM WERE SEEN AT THE SCENE OF THE INCIDENT A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE THE EXPLOSION, PLACING A PACKAGE UNDER THE BUS. "SENDERO LUMINOSO" IS AN EXTREME LEFT-WING REBEL ORGANIZATION WAGING A GUERRILLA WAR AGAINST THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT. "SENDERO LUMINOSO" HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS. IT BEGAN ITS ARMED STRUGGLE IN 1980. SINCE THEN, PERU HAS KNOWN NO PEACE. REPORTS OF MURDERS AND ACTS OF SABOTAGE COMMITTED BY THIS ORGANIZATION ARE APPEARING WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY IN THE WORLD PRESS. THE TERRORISTS' VICTIMS ARE POLITICIANS, MEMBERS OF THE POLICE FORCE, SOLDIERS, PEASANTS.... THE TERRORISTS OFTEN INVOLVE JUVENILES IN THEIR ACTS OF SABOTAGE. THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN FORCED TO RELY MORE AND MORE EXTENSIVELY ON THE ARMED FORCES IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THIS TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. BUT SO FAR THIS HAS FAILED TO PRODUCE TANGIBLE RESULTS.
DEV-MUC3-0287	BOGOTA, 10 JUL 89 -- AFTER SPENDING 130 DAYS ABROAD, BERNARDO JARAMILLO, PRESIDENT OF THE LEFT-WING PATRIOTIC UNION , RETURNED TO COLOMBIA TODAY TO URGE THE CASTROITE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION TO JOIN THE PEACE PROCESS BEING PROMOTED BY THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT. JARAMILLO, A 35-YEAR-OLD LEGISLATOR, REPLACED JAIME PARDO LEAL AS UP PRESIDENT AFTER PARDO LEAL WAS ASSASSINATED IN OCTOBER 1987. JARAMILLO HAD LEFT THE COUNTRY AFTER RECEIVING MANY DEATH THREATS. THE ELN IS THE ONLY COLOMBIAN SUBVERSIVE GROUP THAT REFUSES TO ACCEPT THE PEACE PROPOSALS FORMULATED BY THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO AND INSTEAD HAS INCREASED ITS ATTACKS ON THE COUNTRY'S PETROLEUM INSTALLATIONS TO DEMAND THE NATIONALIZATION OF THAT INDUSTRY. JARAMILLO ASKED THE ELN TO STOP ITS VIOLENT ACTIONS, WHICH, HE SAID, DO NOT IN ANY WAY BENEFIT COLOMBIA. THE LEFTIST LEADER SAID HE IS WELL INFORMED ABOUT THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT AND ADDED THAT "THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT HAS IMPROVED." THE BARCO ADMINISTRATION, HE SAID, HAS BEGUN TO TAKE MEASURES TO PROTECT CITIZENS. "MORE SECURITY MEASURES ARE NEEDED, BUT SOME MEASURES ARE BEING ADOPTED," JARAMILLO SAID. HE STRESSED THAT IF ALL THE SUBVERSIVE GROUPS DECIDE TO HOLD A SINCERE DIALOGUE FOR PEACE, IT WOULD BE VERY POSITIVE FOR THE COUNTRY.
DEV-MUC3-0288	BOGOTA, 13 JUL 89 -- A NEW ATTACK AGAINST THE CANO - LIMON - COVENA OIL PIPELINE, WHICH CAUSED A LARGE OIL SPILL, WAS CARRIED OUT THIS MORNING BY TERRORISTS IN ARAUCA INTENDANCY. ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY REPORTS, THE ATTACK OCCURRED NEAR THE KM - 45 MARKER IN ARAUCITA JURISDICTION, A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE CANO - LIMON - COVENA OIL FIELDS, WHERE LARGE ARMY UNITS ARE BASED.
DEV-MUC3-0289	SAN SALVADOR, 13 JUL 89 -- AT 0600 THIS MORNING, FMLN URBAN GUERRILLAS SET OFF A BOMB IN THE BASEMENT OF THE DEMOCRACY TOWER BUILDING IN WESTERN SAN SALVADOR. THE BOMB DESTROYED APPROXIMATELY 30 PERCENT OF THE WINDOWS IN THE BUILDING. REPORTS INDICATE THAT FMLN URBAN GUERRILLAS DROVE A VEHICLE INTO THE BUILDING'S BASEMENT LOADED WITH GAS TANKS AND A POWERFUL BOMB. THE EXPLOSION SHOOK WESTERN SAN SALVADOR AND DESTROYED 30 PERCENT OF THE WINDOWS IN THE BUILDING. THIS IS THE REPORT WE HAVE ON AN FMLN OPERATION WHICH, AT 0600 THIS MORNING, CAUSED GENERAL ALARM IN WESTERN SAN SALVADOR.
DEV-MUC3-0290	TEGUCIGALPA, 13 JUL 89 -- GOOD MORNING, HRN LISTENERS. I AM A BIT CONCERNED OVER WHAT I HAVE HEARD ON THIS RADIO STATION. THE TRUTH IS THAT AT APPROXIMATELY 0030 TODAY, THERE WAS AN ATTACK WITH A HOMEMADE BOMB IN LA CEIBA, AND, AS A RESULT, SEVEN U.S. SOLDIERS -- NOT SIX -- WERE WOUNDED. FOUR SUSTAINED VERY MINOR INJURIES, WHILE THREE WERE SOMEWHAT SERIOUSLY WOUNDED, BUT THEY ARE NOT IN DANGER OF DYING. NINE SOLDIERS WERE IN THAT GROUP. THEY WERE NOT ON LEAVE; THEY WERE ON A MISSION FROM THE ENRIQUE SOTO CANO HONDURAN AIR BASE AT PALMEROLA. THEY PROVOKED... . INSTEAD, I SHOULD SAY THAT THEY WENT TO HAVE SOME FUN AT THE DILIDO DISCOTEQUE. OUR MILITARY POLICE PATROLS WERE IN THE AREA AND SAW THE ATTACK. WE CAPTURED TWO SUSPECTS. OUR MEN WERE ABOUT 100 METERS AWAY WHEN THE ATTACK OCCURRED, AND, UNFORTUNATELY, THE TWO SUSPECTS ARE U.S. CITIZENS. IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE WERE IN THE AREA AND NO ONE KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. THIS IS AN OFFICIAL REPORT; THIS IS WHAT TOOK PLACE IN LA CEIBA. THE TWO SUSPECTS WERE ARRESTED, AND THEY MUST KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE SEVEN WHO WERE WOUNDED, WHO ARE AT THE HOSPITAL. WHAT YOU REPORTED OVER THE RADIO IS CORRECT. THERE IS NO NEED TO BE ALARMED. IT WAS A HOMEMADE BOMB, AND THE DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY THE SHRAPNEL, CEMENT, AND STONES THAT WERE THROWN INTO THE AIR BY THE EXPLOSION. HOWEVER, I WOULD LIKE TO DENY A REPORT BY THE MILKMAN FROM , WHO SAID THAT THE CITY HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN AND IS BEING HELD HOSTAGE. THAT IS NOT TRUE. WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED, THE PATROLS WERE ALREADY ON THE STREETS AND REPORTED THE INCIDENT. FUSEP WAS INSTRUCTED TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS, AND THEREFORE VEHICLES ENTERING OR LEAVING LA CEIBA WERE STOPPED AND SEARCHED. THAT IS ALL; STANDSTILL MERELY BECAUSE THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WOUNDED, OR BECAUSE TWO OR THREE ARE CRITICALLY WOUNDED. THE CITY MUST FUNCTION NORMALLY. THE ARMED FORCES ARE INTERESTED IN THE CONTINUATION OF PRODUCTION. SO THE MAN FROM WHO CALLED AND SAID THAT HE WAS LOSING 100,000 LEMPIRAS THIS MORNING WAS TELLING A LIE. WE GAVE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS THAT THE INSPECTION OF VEHICLES SHOULD BE CARRIED UNTIL 0500, AND THAT THE VEHICLES SHOULD NOT BE DETAINED. COLONEL, IT WAS THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE PRESIDENT WHO PROVIDED THE REPORT AND SAID THAT THE DELIVERY OF MILK HAD BEEN STOPPED. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT FOR HIM -- WHOM I DO NOT KNOW PERSONALLY -- I MUST SAY THAT IT IS NOT TRUE THAT WE ARE STOPPING VEHICLES . WE STOPPED A VERY SMALL WHITE VAN WITH SOME LABORERS IN IT TO SEARCH THE VAN. I WAS THERE ON THE HIGHWAY. THERE WAS NO MILK ON THAT BUS; THERE WERE PEOPLE ON THAT BUS, AND I MYSELF ALLOWED THEM TO CONTINUE. I AM SORRY THAT THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HAS BEEN MISINFORMED. WE ARE NOT PARALYZING ACTIVITIES, NOR ARE WE HOLDING THE CITY HOSTAGE. AS I SAID, WE ARE TRYING TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION AND WE HAVE ARRESTED TWO PEOPLE. WE ARE NOT SURE IF THEY WERE THE ONES WHO PERPETRATED THE ATTACK; WE ARE NOT SURE OF ANYTHING. WE ARE MERELY CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS AND TAKING PREVENTIVE MEASURES. COLONEL, ARE THE TWO MEN YOU HAVE IN CUSTODY THE SAME U.S. CITIZENS YOU MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS REPORT? YES. THE LIEUTENANT IN CHARGE OF THE PATROL THE PANTS, CLOTHES, AND THE COLOR OF WHAT THEY WERE WEARING INDICATED THAT THEY WERE CIVILIANS. LIEUTENANT SALGADO OF THE 4TH BATTALION WAS 50 METERS AWAY WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED. TWO PERSONS WERE CAPTURED. HOWEVER, THEY HAVE DENIED THAT EITHER OF THEM WAS INVOLVED. THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES FOR THE ARMED FORCES INVESTIGATIVE PERSONNEL TO ARRIVE TO LEARN THE IDENTITIES OF THE TWO MEN WHO ARE BEING HELD. THE INVESTIGATION WILL BE COMPLETELY PROFESSIONAL. WE TWO OR THREE PERSONS WERE INJURED. WE ARE NOT PARALYZING PRODUCTION; I WANT TO MADE THIS CLEAR. YES, OF COURSE. COLONEL, GIVEN THE SITUATION, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE SITUATION IN THE ARMED FORCES IS COMPLETELY NORMAL? OF COURSE IT IS COMPLETELY NORMAL. WE ARE NOT RESTRICTING ANYONE'S FREEDOM. WHEN IT GETS DARK, WE WILL PROCEED TO ASK FOR IDENTIFICATION PAPERS; WE WILL STOP AND CHECK VEHICLES, WHICH IS NORMAL IN THIS TYPE OF SITUATION. HOWEVER, AT NO TIME WILL WE PARALYZE PRODUCTION OR NORMAL DAILY ACTIVITIES. WE ARE TRYING TO FIND THE CULPRITS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ATTACK. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT WAS AN ATTACK AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS, IT WAS CERTAINLY AN ATTACK AGAINST PEACE AND ORDER. WE THEREFORE HAVE TO INVESTIGATE IT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT IT INVOLVED U.S. CITIZENS. IN THIS CASE, AND IN VIEW OF THIS SITUATION, I PERSONALLY ISSUED ORDERS AND FOLLOWED THE INVESTIGATION UNTIL 0500, WHEN I SUSPENDED ALL OPERATIONS. I PERSONALLY ORDERED THESE MEASURES. I AM AMAZED THAT THE CATTLEMEN DO NOT TRANSPORT MILK BEFORE 0500. ONE LAST QUESTION ON THIS MATTER: IS THE SITUATION IN LA CEIBA RELATED TO THE LATEST VIOLENT INCIDENTS IN SAN PEDRO SULA? I BELIEVE SO. A SERIES OF CRIMINAL ACTIONS HAS BEEN LAUNCHED AGAINST SOCIAL PEACE IN HONDURAS. THIS STATION'S LISTENERS AND LISTENERS OF ALL OTHER HONDURAN RADIO STATIONS KNOW THE HIGH - CALIBER OF THE ARMED FORCES PERSONNEL, BEGINNING WITH THE TOP COMMANDERS AND CONTINUING WITH OFFICERS DOWN THE CHAIN OF COMMAND. WE ARE SENSITIVE TO SOCIAL ISSES AND ARE NOT MOTIVATED BY VESTED INTERESTS OF ANY KIND. I BELIEVE THAT THESE ACTS OF BLOODSHED, WHICH ARE , ARE PART OF A SERIES OF FULLY PLANNED, COLDLY CALULATED ACTIONS. I DO NOT WANT TO SOUND LIKE A COMIC STRIP CHARACTER, BUT I BELIEVE THAT THESE ACTIONS ARE CONNECTED AND OVERLAP. I HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT . WE ARE WITNESSING THE EMERGENCE OF THE SO-CALLED WHITE HANDS AND BLACK HANDS , WHICH CONCERN US VERY MUCH. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HONDURANS KILLING HONDURANS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR KINDNESS TO THIS STATION. WE WILL BE CONTACTING YOU DURING THE NEXT FEW HOURS TO LEARN THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS INTO THIS HOMEMADE BOMB ATTACK IN LA CEIBA. WE ARE COMPLETELY AT YOUR SERVICE. WE ARE WILLING TO OFFER YOU INFORMATION AS IT COMES IN. WE ARE A COMPLETELY OPEN, NOT CLOSED, ORGANIZATION. WE WILL GIVE YOU TRUTHFUL, FACTUAL INFORMATION FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL HONDURANS. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING, COLONEL.
DEV-MUC3-0291	BOGOTA, 13 JUL 89 -- TEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN COLOMBIA DURING A THWARTED ATTACK AGAINST PATIOTIC UNION COUNCILMAN GONZALO ALVAREZ HENAO IN MEDELLIN. THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE IN THE EL PEDREGAL NEIGHBORHOOD, BELLO MUNICIPALITY, IN THE NORTHERN PART OF ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT'S CAPITAL CITY. AUTHORITIES REPORT THAT ALL THOSE KILLED BELONGED TO A GROUP OF HIRED ASSASSINS. TWO POLICEMEN WERE AMONG THOSE KILLED. OUR REPORTER LAYS VARGAS HAS THIS REPORT: THE ASSAILANTS ARRIVED AT THE COUNCILMAN'S HOME IN SEVERAL VEHICLES. THEY OPENED FIRE ON THE HOUSE. GONZALO ALVAREZ' BODYGUARDS REPELLED THE ASSAILANTS AND THE COUNCILMAN ESCAPED UNHARMED. A POLICE PATROL IN THE AREA HEARD THE SHOOTOUT AND HELPED SEARCH FOR THE ASSAILANTS. THE SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED IN THE AREA BETWEEN THE EL PEDREGAL AND LA CABANA NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE AREA BETWEEN MEDELLIN AND BELLO. THE PAID ASSASSINS CLASHED WITH AUTHORITIES FOR ALMOST 3 HOURS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE NORTHWESTERN COMMUNITY. SOME OF THE ASSAILANTS SOUGHT REFUGE IN A LA CABANA NEIGHBORHOOD HOME. THE POLICE ARRIVED AT THE HOME AND A LONG SHOOT-OUT ENSUED, RESULTING IN THE DEATHS OF THE PAID ASSASSINS.
DEV-MUC3-0292	LA PAZ, 3 JUL 89 -- DAVID ANEZ, LEADER OF THE BLOC OF CONGRESSMEN FROM BENI DEPARTMENT, SAID YESTERDAY THAT "THE BENI PEOPLE ARE PERIODICALLY SUFFERING RETALIATORY ATTACKS BY UMOPAR AND DEA AGENTS, WHO ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN REPRESSIVE ACTIONS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POLULATION, NOT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKERS." ANEZ MADE THESE REMARKS WHILE COMMENTING ON LAST WEEK'S INCIDENTS IN SANTA ANA DE YACUMA. ANEZ CHARGED THAT THE ATTACKS ARE PERPETRATED AGAINST "OPEN, PEACEFUL CIVILIANS; THAT IS, AGAINST CITIZENS WHO ARE IN NO WAY INVOLVED IN THE DRUG TRADE. NEVERTHELESS, THEY ARE MURDERED OR HARASSED IN WAYS NOT IN KEEPING WITH THE DEMOCRATIC ATMOSPHERE THAT SHOULD PREVAIL IN THE COUNTRY." ANEZ SAID THE PEOPLE OF SANTA ANA ARE RESTLESS AND THAT ALL BENI DEPARTMENT ORGANIZATIONS ARE ALERT TO DEMAND THAT THE GOVERNMENT ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE RECENT INCIDENTS. ANEZ ANNOUNCED THAT, AS LEADER OF THE BENI CONGRESSIONAL BLOC, HE SENT A LETTER TO PRESIDENT VICTOR PAZ ESTENSSORO IN WHICH HE OUTLINES THE ISSUE THE GOVERNMENT MUST ADDRESS TO PREVENT FURTHER CLASHES BETWEEN CIVILIANS AND SECURITY FORCES. ANEZ SAID THE GOVERNMENT MUST ADDRESS THE ANTIDRUG STRUGGLE IN BENI DEPARTMENT FROM THE INSTITUTIONAL, SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND INTERNATIONAL STANDPOINTS BECAUSE THE DRUG TRADE GOES BEYOND BENI BORDERS; IT IS AN INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITY THAT HAS BUILT AN ECONOMIC EMPIRE FAR MORE POWERFUL THAN THE BENI PEOPLE, ALL BOLIVIANS, AND THAN THE BOLIVIAN GOVERNMENT ITSELF.
DEV-MUC3-0293	MOSCOW , 14 JUL 89 -- PERUVIAN COMMUNISTS HAVE FIRMLY CONDEMNED THE TERRORIST ACT CARRIED OUT BY THE PERUVIAN REACTION AGAINST SOVIET FISHERMEN. AS HAS BEEN REPORTED, THE TERRORISTS PLACED A CHARGE OF DYNAMITE UNDER A BUS IN WHICH THERE WERE SOVIET FISHERMEN FROM SEVERAL TRAWLERS. IN THE ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE PERUVIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE, IT IS POINTED OUT THAT THIS CRIME PURSUES THE AIM OF UNDERMINING RELATIONS BETWEEN PERU AND THE SOCIALIST COUNTRIES.
DEV-MUC3-0294	SAN SALVADOR, 14 JUL 89 -- THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAVE BANNED ENTRANCE INTO THE UNIVERSITY OF EL SALVADOR CAMPUS AND ARE THREATENING TO FIRE ON ANYONE WHO DISOBEYS THIS ORDER. THIS AFTERNOON, THE ARMY ALLOWED NEITHER VEHICLES NOR STUDENTS TO ENTER THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS. ACCORDING TO MILITARY OFFICIALS, ORDERS WERE GIVEN TO SHOOT ANYONE WHO DISOBEYED BY ATTEMPTING TO ENTER THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS. THE MEASURE WENT INTO EFFECT AT 1730. THE SITUATION GREW TENSE WHEN PRIVATE CARS ATTEMPTED TO ENTER THE CAMPUS GROUNDS. UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS MET WITH THE MILITARY. ACCORDING TO THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND, SINCE 23 DECEMBER 1988, THE MILITARY HAS NOT ALLOWED WEAPONS TO BE INTRODUCED INTO OR TAKEN OUT OF THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS. THE DISCUSSION ON WHETHER TO ALLOW THE ENTRANCE OF STUDENTS AND VEHICLES BECAME HEATED. UNIVERSITY GENERAL MANAGER MARIO ALFREDO CABRERA SAID THAT THIS MEASURE IS INTENDED TO SHUT DOWN THE UNIVERSITY. ALL OF THIS FALLS UNDER THE GENERAL CAMPAIGN OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AGGRESSION AGAINST THE UNIVERSITY TO MINIMIZE ITS AUTHORITY IN LIGHT OF ITS ROLE AS THE GOVERNMENT'S AND THE NATION'S CONSCIENCE, WHICH OFFICIALS -- WHO ARE NOT LEADING THE COUNTRY ALONG THE CORRECT PATH -- DO NOT LIKE. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE BASIC REASON BEHIND THIS AND OTHER MEASURES. THESE MEASURES INCLUDE HELICOPTERS OVERFLYING THE CAMPUS AT VERY LOW ALTITUDES AND SOLDIERS THREATENING TO SHOOT TO KILL IF THE ORDER IS DISOBEYED. SINCE THE MILITARY BLOCKADE WENT INTO EFFECT, SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS HAVE BEEN OVERFLYING THE CAMPUS.
DEV-MUC3-0295	CLANDESTINE, 15 JUL 89 -- ATTENTION, SALVADORAN PEOPLE. THIS IS OUR WAR BULLETIN FROM THE MODESTO RAMIREZ CENTRAL FRONT IN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT. ON 15 JULY, GUERRILLAS BEGAN THE OPERATION CALLED WE WILL DEFEAT ARENA'S DICTATORSHIP BY HITTING THE PUPPET ARMY. THIS OPERATION WAS CARRIED OUT AGAINST TWO POSITIONS OF THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE'S AZMITIA BATTALION STATIONED IN CHALATENANGO, SPECIFICALLY AGAINST AN IRA CENTER IN SAN JOSE EL CARAO, EL PARAISO. THIS IS HOW THE OPERATION WAS CARRIED OUT: SIMULTANEOUS ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT ON THREE OF THE ARMY'S FORTIFIED PERIPHERAL DEFENSE POSITIONS. ONE OF THESE POSITIONS WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED, RESULTING IN 11 OF THE ENEMY KILLED. FOUR ADDITIONAL CASUALTIES WERE INFLICTED ON THE ENEMY IN THE THREE OTHER DEFENSE FORTIFICATIONS, WHICH WERE ALSO DESTROYED. WE ALSO ATTACKED THE MAIN SUPPLY CENTER FACILITIES AND STORMED THREE DEFENSIVE POSITIONS IN THE INTERIOR. AS A RESULT OF THIS ATTACK, FOUR OF THE ENEMY WERE KILLED AND FIVE WERE WOUNDED. IN ADDITION, WE DESTROYED THE OFFICES AND A GRAIN DRYER AND DAMAGED THE STORAGE BINS AND GRAIN STORAGE AREAS. WE CONCLUDED THE ATTACK BY SETTING THE ENTIRE FACILITY ON FIRE. THE FOLLOWING MILITARY EQUIPMENT WAS SEIZED FROM THE ENEMY DURING THIS VICTORIOUS OPERATION: 3 M-16 RIFLES, 3 FULL SETS , 1 M-79 GRENADE LAUNCHER WITH 9 GRENADES, 550 5.56-MM ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION, 2 100-CARTRIDGE M-60 AMMUNITION BELTS, UNIFORMS, BOOTS, AND OTHER MILITARY SUPPLIES. ONE HOUR AFTER THE ATTACK BEGAN, THE ENEMY WAS REINFORCED BY A ROCKET-FIRING HELICOPTER, ONE PUSH-PULL O-2 AIRCRAFT, AND ONE C-47 AIRCRAFT. IN ADDITION, THE ENEMY RECEIVED ARTILLERY SUPPORT FROM THE AREAS ABOVE THE INSTALLATIONS UNDER ATTACK, BUT THIS FIRE AND THE AIR SUPPORT WERE INEFFECTIVE. THE C-47 AIRCRAFT STRAFED LAS PENAS, WITH COMPLETE DISREGARD FOR THE CIVILIAN POPULATION, A REPRESSIVE ACTION WE VEHEMENTLY DENOUNCE. LATER, AT 0300, THE ENEMY TROOPS WERE REINFORCED BY TWO ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS AND FOUR MILITARY TRUCKS, WHICH TOOK TROOPS TO A PLACE NEAR THE IRA INSTALLATION. THESE REINFORCEMENTS WERE QUICKLY NEUTRALIZED BY OUR RIFLE FIRE. IN ADDITION, THE OPERATION INCLUDED A LARGE NUMBER OF MILITIAMEN AND REBEL TROOPS, WHO ERECTED ROADBLOCKS ON THE STREETS OF NUEVA CONCEPCION, BLEW UP SIX TELEPHONE POSTS, PLACED A LARGE BANNER ACROSS THE STREET, AND DISTRIBUTED PROPAGANDA. OTHER PROPAGANDA ACTIVITIES OCCURRED IN SAN JOSE PATARES, LA SIEMBRE, GUAYABITO, AND HORCONES IN LA PALMA JUSRISDICTION. IN ALL, WE INFLICTED 24 CASUALTIES, INCLUDING DEAD AND WOUNDED, ON THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE; HOWEVER, WE LOST COMRADE OTONIEL IN THE ATTACK.
DEV-MUC3-0296	CARACAS , 17 JUL 89 -- WE HAVE REPORTS THAT NORBERTO RODRIGUEZ COULD STILL BE IN THE BORDER REGION, NEAR THE SPOT WHERE HE WAS KIDNAPPED BY THOSE PEOPLE. WE DO NOT KNOW WHO THE KIDNAPPERS ARE. WE ARE WORKING ON THIS. HAVE YOU STEPPED UP SURVEILLANCE IN THE AREA? HAS FINDING THE STATION WAGON GIVEN YOU ANY CLUES? YES, OF COURSE, WE ARE LOOKING INTO THIS. THE COLOMBIAN POLICE HAVE THE INFORMATION AND ARE WORKING BASED ON THIS. WHAT ABOUT A RANSOM? HAS THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT BEEN CONTACTED? THERE HAS BEEN NO CONTACT. WE ARE HOPING THERE WILL BE A CONTACT SO THAT WE CAN PROCEED FROM THERE. IS IT TRUE A RANSOM HAS BEEN DEMANDED? I HAVE NO PROOF OF THAT. I DO NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION. WHAT IS THE MOST RECENT INFORMATION THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT HAS RECEIVED? WE WERE BRIEFED ON THE WORK BEING COORDINATED WITH THE COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES. WE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM, LIKE BROTHERS. THE TWO ARMIES AND THE AUTHORITIES ARE WORKING TOGETHER. IF A RANSOM IS DEMANDED, IS THE GOVERNMENT WILLING TO PAY IT? I CANNOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION; THAT WOULD DEPEND ON RODRIGUEZ' FAMILY. THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH KIDNAPPINGS. WHAT DO THEY SAY ABOUT THIS CASE? WHAT DO THEY THINK THE OUTCOME WILL BE? WE ALWAYS WORK BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR CASES. THIS KIDNAPPING COULD HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT BY THE REBELS, AND WE ALREADY KNOW HOW THE REBELS OPERATE. HE ALSO COULD HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED BY COMMON CRIMINALS. EVEN THOUGH IT MAY SEEM THAT THE CASE WOULD BE HANDLED SIMILARLY IN BOTH INSTANCES, IT IS NOT SO. WE ARE GOING TO WAIT A BIT LONGER. WE BELIEVE WE MAY GET MORE INFORMATION TODAY. IT IS NOT VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT POLICY TO PAY RANSOM IN CASES SUCH AS THIS ONE. WILL AN EXCEPTION BE MADE IN THIS CASE? I BELIEVE WE SHOULD FOLLOW OUR POLICY. THERE ARE MEANS THAT CAN BE USED TO REACH AN UNDERSTANDING; THIS WOULD HAPPEN ONCE WE HAVE SPECIFIC INFORMATION.
DEV-MUC3-0297	SAN SALVADOR, 17 JUL 89 -- MAURICIO MEJIA, GENERAL SECRETARY OF EL SALVADOR UNIVERSITY, REPORTED THAT APPROXIMATELY SIX PERSONS WERE WOUNDED IN A SHOOT-OUT THAT TOOK PLACE WHEN SOLDIERS ENTERED THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS AND BEGAN SHOOTING RANDOMLY. ONE OF THE PERSONS WOUNDED WAS A U.S. STUDENT WHO WAS VISITING THE UNIVERSITY. MEMBERS OF THE RED CROSS IDENTIFIED THE U.S. STUDENT AS ROBERTO BRENOW, 26. ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS, THE STUDENTS HELD A DEMONSTRATION LATE IN THE AFTERNOON TO DEMAND THAT THE GOVERNMENT WITHDRAW TROOPS FROM THE UNIVERSITY AREA AND RELEASE STUDENTS WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED. AFTER THE DEMONSTATION ENDED, EXPLOSIONS WERE HEARD AND SOLDIERS BEGAN SHOOTING FROM DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AROUND THE UNIVERSITY. AFTER DARK, SOLDIERS ENTERED THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS AND BEGAN FIRING RANDOMLY AND THE SOUND OF EXPLODING MOLOTOV COCKTAILS COULD BE HEARD ACROSS THE CAMPUS, WHICH CAUSED PANIC AMONG THE STUDENTS.
DEV-MUC3-0298	SANTIAGO, 18 JUL 89 -- INTERIOR MINISTER CARLOS CACERES TODAY STATED THAT THE GANG-STYLE ACTION AKEN YESTERDAY BY SOME PEOPLE TO OCCUPY PRIVATE PROPERTY WILL NOT INTIMIDATE THE GOVERNMENT. YESTERDAY, A WELL-ORGANIZED GROUP OF APPROXIMATELY 300 PEOPLE ATTEMPTED TO USURP PRIVATE PROPERTY USING MOLOTOV COCKTAILS, STONES AND FIREARMS. THEIR ACTION CAUSED ONE UNFORTUNATE DEATH, INJURIES, AND DAMAGE -- WHICH WERE REPORTED EARLIER -- TO THE DETRIMENT OF A LARGE NUMBER OF POOR FAMILIES. IT IS PUBLICLY EVIDENT THAT THE COMMUNISTS AND THEIR CLOSEST ALLIES WERE BEHIND THE PREPARATION, COORDINATION AND EXECUTION OF THESE CRIMINALS ACTIONS. UNFORTUNATELY, ONE CANNOT FAIL TO LINK THESE ACTIONS TO THE THREATENING, VIOLENT SPEECHES -- FOLLOWING THE STYLE USED BY THE POPULAR UNITY MEMBERS -- WITH WHICH SOME LEADERS OF THE OPPOSITION COALITION OPENED THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN OF THEIR CANDIDATE PATRICIO AYLWIN. IT IS EVEN POSSIBLE TO REGARD THESE AGGRESSIONS AS SIGNALS AND WARNINGS OF THE INCONSISTENCIES AND CONTRADICTIONS THAT EXIST WITHIN SOME POLITICAL UMBRELLA GROUPS. THESE GROUPS CONSIST OF SECTORS ADVOCATING A PEACEFUL DEMOCRATIC COEXISTENCE ON THE ONE HAND, AND OTHER SECTORS THAT FOLLOW THE LINE OF THOSE WHO IN THE PAST DESTROYED OUR TRADITIONAL WAY OF LIFE ON THE OTHER HAND. ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAS STATED ITS DECISION NOT TO GET INVOLVED IN THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN, IT CANNOT FAIL TO ANNOUNCE ITS POSITION AND TO STATE ITS OUTRIGHT REJECTION OF A MALICIOUS AND DEMAGOGICAL RHETORIC THAT POSES A THREAT TO PUBLIC TRANQUILLITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE GOVERNMENT YIELD TO THOSE WHO TIME AND AGAIN SEEK AND PROMOTE SUBVERSION AND TO DISRUPT OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONAL ORDER.
DEV-MUC3-0299	CLANDESTINE, 18 JUL 89 -- CONCERNING MONDAY'S INCIDENTS NEAR EL SALVADOR UNIVERSITY, THE FMLN STATES: 1. NONE OF OUR UNITS WERE OPERATING AROUND EL SALVADOR UNIVERSITY OR THE NORTHERN SECTOR OF THE CAPITAL ON THAT DAY. 2. THE CLASHES THAT OCCURRED NEAR THE UNIVERSITY WERE CARRIED OUT BY ARMED FORCES TROOPS ALONE. IN AN EFFORT TO SEARCH THE UNIVERSITY, THE TROOPS FIRED THEIR WEAPONS AS STUDENT DEMONSTRATORS WERE ENTERING THE CAMPUS. 3. THIS ACTION IS PART OF A PLAN THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND THE TOP COMMAND OF THE ARMED FORCES ARE PROMOTING AGAINST EL SALVADOR UNIVERSITY. THIS PLAN IS BEING CARRIED OUT BY COLONEL FRANCISCO ELENA FUENTES, COMMANDER OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE. THE PLAN INVOLVES THREATS, ARRESTS, MURDERS, AND OTHER REPRESSIVE ACTS. 4. IT IS PREDICTABLE THAT THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND THE TOP COMMAND OF THE ARMED FORCES WILL SAY THAT WHAT OCCURRED AT THE UNIVERSITY WAS THE RESULT OF A CLASH BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE FMLN, AND THIS IS COMPLETELY FALSE. CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE VIOLENT INCIDENTS THAT CLAIMED SEVERAL VICTIMS IN THE AREA AROUND EL SALVADOR UNIVERSITY.
DEV-MUC3-0300	BOGOTA, 18 JUL 89 -- THE COLOMBIAN POLICE TODAY RESCUED MANUEL VALLEJO URIBE, A BUSINESSMAN, WHO THEY FOUND UNHARMED. DURING THE RESCUE OPERATION, THE POLICE KILLED SIX KIDNAPPERS, ACCORDING TO AN OFFICAL POLICE REPORT. VALLEJO URIBE, 32, WAS RELEASED IN BELLO, NEAR MEDELLIN, THE SECOND LARGEST CITY IN COLOMBIA, AS THE RESULT OF INTELLIGENCE GATHERED BY THE METROPOLITAN POLICE, POLICE SOURCES ADDED. THE BUSINESSMAN, WHO OWNS A TANNERY AND SPENDS MOST OF HIS TIME IN MIAMI, WAS KIDNAPPED ON 9 JULY BY SEVERAL UNKNOWN PERSONS. THE POLICE REPORTED THAT DURING THE BELLO RESCUE OPERATION, SIX KIDNAPPERS, ALL COMMON CRIMINALS WHO TRIED TO PREVENT THE POLICE FROM RESCUING HIM, WERE KILLED.
DEV-MUC3-0301	SAN SALVADROR, 19 JUL 89 -- SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS GIVEN ASSURANCES THAT THERE WILL BE NO MILITARY INTERVENTION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EL SALVADOR CAMPUS, DESPITE THE VIOLENT INCIDENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS. THESE INCIDENTS HAVE NOT RESULTED IN ANY DEATHS, ALTHOUGH SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INJURED. THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT THE INCIDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY ARE PART OF A BROADER PLAN TO PROVOKE THE 1ST BRIGADE TROOPS PATROLLING THE AREA. HOWEVER, THE PRESIDENT ADDED, THERE WILL BE NO MILITARY INTERVENTION AT THE UNIVERSITY, EVEN IF THE SOLDIERS WHO ARE SURROUNDING THE CAMPUS ARE PROVOKED. TWO STUDENTS WHO WERE ARRESTED LAST WEEK AND WHO WERE PRESENTED BY THE TREASURY POLICE HAVE ADMITTED THEIR PARTICIPATION IN LEFTIST, DESTABILIZING GROUPS' ACTIVITIES. ONE OF THE STUDENTS ARRESTED IS LUIS OSVALDO SANDOVAL, A FIFTH - GRADE STUDENT AT THE JOSE MATIAS SALGADO SCHOOL, WHO ADMITTED BEING A MEMBER OF THE BREAD, LAND, WORK, AND FREEDOM MOVEMENT AND THAT HE HAS PARTICIPATED IN ACTIVITIES SUCH AS WRITING MESSAGES AND PASTING PROPAGANDA ON WALLS AND BURNING VEHICLES. THE SECOND STUDENT ARRESTED IS RAMON PARADA GARCIA, A 2D - YEAR STUDENT AT THE , WHO SAID THAT HE IS A MEMBER OF THE ERP . THE TWO YOUTHS SAID THAT THEY JOINED THESE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE PAID ON A MONTHLY BASIS, EXPLAINING THAT THEIR FAMILIES HAVE NO OTHER SOURCE OF INCOME. THE TREASURY POLICE SAID THAT THE ARRESTED STUDENTS HAVE REQUESTED THE PROTECTION OF THAT SECURITY FORCE.
DEV-MUC3-0302	SAN SALVADOR, 19 JUL 89 -- WE HAVE FURTHER REPORTS ON THIS MORNING'S ATTACK ON GUILLERMO PAYES, SECOND IN CHARGE OF THE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS INSTITUTE . AS WE REPORTED EARLIER, THE IRI WAS ONCE PART OF THE PATRIOTIC CIVIL DEFENSE IN SAN SALVADOR, WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN DISBANDED. WE HAVE FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO ENTER A SHOP WHEN HE WAS SHOT AT FIVE TIMES AT LEAST; WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT ONLY THREE BULLETS ACTUALLY STRUCK HIM. ONE HIT HIM IN THE BACK, ANOTHER IN THE ABDOMINAL REGION, AND ONE IN THE THROAT -- A TOTAL OF THREE BULLETS HIT HIM. FOLLOWING AN OPERATION, DOCTORS EXPECT HIM TO LIVE; HOWEVER, THUS FAR NO DETAILED MEDICAL REPORT HAS BEEN ISSUED.
DEV-MUC3-0303	HAMBURG , 20 JUL 89 -- TELEVISION STATION AND AT LEAST ONE RADIO STATION, SPOKESMEN OF TELEVISION CHANNEL 7 -- WHICH WAS THE TELEVISION STATION AFFECTED BY THE BLAST -- TOLD DPA. ACCORDING TO INITIAL REPORTS, THE BOMB WAS SET OFF ON ALUX MOUNTAIN, APPROXIMATELY 20 KM WEST OF THE GUATEMALAN CAPITAL. MOST RADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS HAVE TRANSMISSION TOWERS ON THAT MOUNTAIN BECAUSE IT TOWERS OVER A VAST AREA OF GUATEMALA. IT HAS BEEN LEARNED THAT A MAN, WHO IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN THE WATCHMAN AT CHANNEL 7'S TOWER, WAS KILLED BY THE BOMB. THE SPOKESMEN SAID THAT RESCUE UNITS SENT TO THE SITE HAVE YET TO RETURN TO THE CAPITAL. THE EXPLOSION WAS FELT IN SEVERAL NEARBY COMMUNITIES AND IN A SECTOR OF GUATEMALA CITY. CHANNEL 7 SUDDENLY WENT OFF THE AIR JUST AS GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO AREVALO WAS ABOUT TO DELIVER A SPEECH. NEVERTHELESS, THE SPEECH WAS BROADCAST BY THE OTHER FOUR TELEVISION CHANNELS THAT OPERATE IN GUATEMALA. THIS TERRORIST ACTION COMES IN THE WAKE OF A SERIES OF INCIDENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THE PAST FEW DAYS AS A RESULT OF STRIKES BY TEACHERS, POST OFFICE WORKERS, FINANCE MINISTRY EMPLOYEES, AND OTHER SECTORS DEMANDING WAGE INCREASES. A BOMB WAS FOUND BEFORE IT EXPLODED IN A BANK IN THE AFTERNOON OF 19 JULY, AND SEVERAL ANONYMOUS CALLERS WARNED ABOUT OTHER TERRORIST BOMBS LAST NIGHT; HOWEVER, THESE TURNED OUT TO BE FALSE ALARMS.
DEV-MUC3-0304	TEGUCIGALPA, 20 JUL 89 -- WITH SIMULTANEOUS BOMB EXPLOSIONS IN THE HONDURAN CAPITAL AND LA CEIBA PORT, LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 355 KM FROM TEGUCIGALPA ON THE ATLANTIC COAST, A NEW GUERRILLA GROUP CALLING ITSELF THE "9 MAY" PEOPLE'S LIBERATION FORCES, FPL, ANNOUNCED ITS EMERGENCE AS ONE OF THE ARMED ORGANIZATIONS STRUGGLING FOR POWER. THREE BOMBS WENT OFF SIMULTANEOUSLY IN TEGUCIGALPA, ONE AT THE CENTRAL PARK, ANOTHER AT THE STATE-RUN UNIVERSITY OF HONDURAS, AND ANOTHER AT A TRAINING SCHOOL FOR TEACHERS. AT THE SAME TIME, A BOMB EXPLODED AT A UNIVERSITY BRANCH IN LA CEIBA. ALL THE BLASTS OCCURRED AT 1130 . ONLY ONE PERSON WHO HAPPENED TO BE PASSING BY THE CENTRAL PARK IN TEGUCIGALPA AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION WAS WOUNDED AS A RESULT OF THE BLASTS. A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE NEW GROUP POINTS OUT THAT "ONE DOES NOT WEEP FOR MARTYRS, BUT AVENGES THEM" AND ADDS THAT "TRAITOR INDIANS COME BEFORE THE INVADING GRINGOS." THE PROCLAMATION CRITICIZES THE MURDER OF POPULAR LEADERS THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE COUNTRY IN EARLY JULY AND DENOUNCES OTHER LEFTIST LABOR AND GUERRILLA ORGANIZATIONS. THE ARMED FORCES, THROUGH ITS COMMANDER, GENERAL HUMBERTO REGALADO HERNANDEZ, RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY BY STATING THAT "THE ONLY REAL COMMUNISTS LEFT IN THE WORLD ARE HONDURANS, BECAUSE THEY ARE CHANGING IN OTHER COUNTRIES" AND ARE NO LONGER EXPLODING BOMBS. THE MILITARY LEADER ASKED PEOPLE TO ATTACH NO SIGNIFICANCE TO THE INCIDENT AND SAID THAT SHOULD THE WAVE OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE CONTINUE, LEFTIST GROUPS WOULD HAVE TO BE CALLED TO A DIALOGUE TO AVOID OTHER SIMILAR ACTIONS. THE "9 MAY" FPL PROCLAMATION WAS ISSUED IN THE NORTHERN CITY OF SAN PEDRO SULA, 255 KM FROM TEGUCIGALPA.
DEV-MUC3-0305	SAN PEDRO SULA, 20 JUL 89 -- TEGUCIGALPA -- THE PEOPLE'S ORGANIZATIONS COORDINATING COMMITTEE AND THE UNITED FEDERATION OF HONDURAN WORKERS CHARGED YESTERDAY THAT THERE IS A TERRORIST PLAN TO ELIMINATE EVERYONE WHO OPPOSES THE U.S. MILITARY OCCUPATION OF THE COUNTRY. IN A NEWS CONFERENCE, THE LEADERS OF THE ORGANIZATIONS SAID THAT THE DEATH THREATS AGAINST LABOR AND THE PEOPLE'S LEADERS ARE INCLUDED IN THIS PLAN, WHICH FORMS PART OF THE U.S. POLICY ON HONDURAS. REFERRING TO THE RECENT ASSASSINATIONS IN SAN PEDRO SULA, CCOP COORDINATOR JUAN ALMENDARES BONILLA SAID THAT HONDURAS "IS AN OCCUPIED COUNTRY WHERE THERE IS A U.S.-SPONSORED POLICY OF TERROR THAT SEEKS TO ANNIHILATE ALL THE GROUPS THAT PROTEST THE VIOLATION OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY." HE EXPLAINED THAT THERE ARE VARIOUS FORMS OF TERROR. FOR EXAMPLE, HE SAID ARMED GROUPS ARRIVE AT HOUSES AT NIGHT AND RAPE ENTIRE FAMILIES. "THESE POLICIES OF TERROR HAVE BEEN USED IN BRAZIL, CHILE, VIETNAM, EL SALVADOR, AND GUATEMALA, AMONG OTHER COUNTRIES," HE SAID. THE FORMER UNIVERSITY RECTOR SAID THAT THIS POLICY OF TERROR, WHICH HAS RECENTLY BEEN INTENSIFIED, TRIES TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A SUBVERSIVE CELL THAT IS DESTABILIZING THE COUNTRY PRIOR TO THE HOLDING OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT IN TELA, ATLANTIDA DEPARTMENT. THE PEOPLE'S LEADERS SAID THAT "THE TERRORISM OF THE HONDURAN DEMOCRATIC STATE IS ALSO SHOWN BY AN ELECTORAL PROCESS THAT IS EXTENSIVELY CONTROLLED BY THE AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE EXECUTION OF POOR HONDURANS BY REPRESSIVE FORCES THAT HAVE BEEN TRAINED BY U.S. EXPERTS." THEY SAID THE TERRORISM IS ALSO DEMOSTRATED IN THE NONFULFILLMENT OF THE ESQUIPULAS II PEACE AGREEMENTS, BY A POLICY THAT CAPITULATES TO THE IMF AND THE WORLD BANK, THE MAINTENANCE OF EXTREME SECURITY, AND THE FACILITIES GIVEN TO THE THE CONTRAS AND THE U.S. ARMY. AFTER MAKING THE PREVIOUS ANALYSIS, THE FUTH AND THE CCOP ASKED THE GOVERNMENT TO HALT STATE TERRORISM AND TO BRING TO JUSTICE THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE POLITICAL CRIMES AGAINST THE PEOPLE'S LEADERS. THEY ALSO DEMANDED THAT THE PEACE AGREEMENTS BE RESPECTED, THAT THE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION COMMISSION'S REPORT ON REPRESSION BE MADE KNOWN, AND THAT THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS BE DEMOBILIZED. THEY ALSO PROPOSED THAT THE STATE CARRY OUT A REAL POLICY OF DEMOCRATIZATION WITH THE PEOPLE'S PARTICIPATION IN THE FACE OF PRESSURE FROM THE IMF, THE WORLD BANK, AND THE U.S. EMBASSY. THEY ALSO DEMANDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT ADOPT A PATRIOTIC POSITION SO THAT THE U.S. BASES AND THE CONTRAS WILL BE WITHDRAWN FROM HONDURAS BECAUSE THEY CONSTITUTE A THREAT TO PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA. THE CCOP AND THE FUTH ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAVE SCHEDULED "A GREAT MARCH FOR NATIONAL DIGNITY" THIS AFTERNOON TO MARK THE HEROIC DEEDS OF LEMPIRA, THE DEFENDER OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND DIGNITY. THE MARCH WILL BEGIN AT 1600 AT THE COMAYAGUELA OBELISK AND END AT TEGUCIGALPA'S MAIN SQUARE. THE DEMONSTRATION WILL ALSO DEMAND THE REJECTION OF THE IMF AND WORLD BANK'S PROPOSALS, THE EXPULSION OF THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS AND RESPECT FOR THE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENTS.
DEV-MUC3-0306	BOGOTA, 20 JUL 89 -- THE NATIONAL POLICE REPORTED THAT THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION-CAMILIST UNION TODAY CARRIED OUT ITS SIXTH ATTACK THIS YEAR AGAINST THE PACIFIC OIL PIPELINE, WHICH LINKS THE COLOMBIAN TOWNS OF ORITO AND TUMACO NEAR THE COLOMBIAN-ECUADORAN BORDER. THE REBELS USED EXPLOSIVES TO BLOW UP 1 METER OF PIPELINE. THIS IS THE REBELS' 33D ATTACK AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S OIL NETWORK IN 1989. THE AUTHORITIES REPORTED THAT THERE WAS NO OIL SPILL BECAUSE AT THE TIME OF THE ATTACK, NO OIL WAS BEING PUMPED THROUGH THE PIPELINE. A WOMAN WHO SAID SHE WAS SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE UC-ELN CALLED THE CALI MEDIA TO CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK. THE UC-ELN IS ATTACKING COLOMBIA'S OIL PIPELINES AS A WAY TO PRESSURE THE GOVERNMENT TO NATIONALIZE THE OIL INDUSTRY AND TO SIGN MORE FAVORABLE CONTRACTS WITH MULTINATIONAL OIL COMPANIES. THIS YEAR ALONE, THE UC-ELN LAUNCHED 25 ATTACKS ON THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS OIL PIPELINE, THE LONGEST IN COLOMBIA. THE ATTACKS ON THE CANO LIMON- COVENAS PIPELINE HAVE CAUSED APPROXIMATE $150 MILLION IN DAMAGE. IF THE SIX ATTACKS ON THE PACIFIC OIL PIPELINE AND THE TWO ON THE DINA-SALGAR OIL PIPELINE ARE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION, LOSSES AMOUNT TO APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION. THE DINA-SALGAR PIPELINE CARRIES CRUDE OIL FROM THE OIL FIELDS IN TOLIMA TO THE REFINERY IN BARRANCABERMEJA.
DEV-MUC3-0307	SAN SALVADOR, 20 JUL 89 -- SALVADORAN PEOPLE: I ADDRESS YOU ON THIS OCCASION TO GIVE YOU MY FIRST REPORT ON THE STATE OF THE COUNTRY. I MAKE THIS REPORT 50 DAYS AFTER ASSUMING POWER. AT THIS TIME I WANT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH; I WANT TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT OUR SITUATION IS SO THAT WE WILL ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT WE MUST DO IN THE FUTURE. EVERY SALVADORAN MUST SHARE IN THE SACRIFICE AND EFFORT. THOSE OF US WHO HAVE A BIT MUST SHOW SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO HAVE NOTHING OR VERY LITTLE. THE SITUATION IS CRITICAL, BUT WE MUST CONFRONT IT. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT: TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. WE ARE WILLING TO DO THIS RESPONSIBLY, BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT DOING NOTHING WOULD MEAN A GREATER CRISIS FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND WOULD SINK OUR HOMELAND EVEN DEEPER IN THE BLACK ABYSS. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY CONCERNS; WE HAVE HEARD DIFFERENT GROUPS ASKING THAT THE GOVERNMENT STATE WHAT IT IS PLANNING TO DO TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS. I WOULD LIKE TO STATE, HOWEVER, THAT WE PREFER TO ACT CALMLY, STUDY THE PROBLEM IN DEPTH, AND FIND A SOLUTION THAT WILL TRULY SOLVE THE PROBLEM. WE WOULD RATHER DO THIS THAN MAKE A RASH DECISION AND MAKE A MISTAKE. THIS IS A TRULY DIFFICULT TASK. BECAUSE I WANT TO TELL YOU IN ALL HONESTY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY, I WISH TO TOUCH ON THE THREE MAJOR AREAS THAT CREATE CONCERN AND THAT I FEEL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT. FIRST, LET US TALK ABOUT PEACE. SINCE THIS GOVERNMENT WAS SWORN AND INDISCRIMINATE MURDERS. THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS, BECAUSE ON 1 JUNE WE EXPRESSED OUR RESOLVE TO SIT DOWN AND TALK TO FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT. THE FMLN'S RESPONSE, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN MORE VIOLENCE. WE KNOW MANY GROUPS COMPLAIN ABOUT THE VIOLENCE AND INSECURITY; THEY HAVE EVERY REASON TO COMPLAIN. THE ARMED FORCES ARE WILLING TO DO ALL THEY CAN TO PROTECT EVERYONE. THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS IN THE PAST DAYS, ESPECIALLY IN THOSE AREAS WHERE THE TERRORIST ATTACKS HAVE BEEN STRONGER. THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED MANY TIMES AND BY MANY GROUPS, ESPECIALLY THOSE GROUPS THAT IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SHARE THE FMLN'S IDEAS. THEY CLAIM THAT THE ARMED FORCES ACT IN A REPRESSIVE MANNER. DEAR SALVADORAN PEOPLE, LET US ANALYZE WHAT REALLY IS HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY. THE ARMED FORCES' DUTY IS TO CONTROL ALL THOSE SITUATIONS IN WHICH THE LAW IS BROKEN. THE ARMED FORCES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING PUBLIC ORDER. THE ARMED FORCES ONLY TAKE ACTION WHEN THERE ARE GROUPS THAT ONLY CREATE VIOLENCE AND DISRUPT PUBLIC ORDER. THE ARMED FORCES DO NOT TAKE ACTION JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT TO TAKE ACTION. WE HAVE AN ARMED FORCES TO DEFEND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND NEVER TO ATTACK THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. THEREFORE, WHAT WE MUST DO IS LOOK AROUND AND SEE WHO IS REFUSING TO MAKE A COMMITMENT AND WHO IS REFUSING TO SIT DOWN, IN A RATIONAL AND PEACEFUL MANNER, TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS CONFLICT THAT NO LONGER HAS A PLACE IN OUR HISTORY. THEREFORE, I WOULD LIKE TO REPEAT WHAT WE, AS A GOVERNMENT, SAID ON 1 JUNE. ON THAT DAY WE EXPRESSED OUR WILLINGNESS TO SIT DOWN AND TALK. I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS THIS A BIT, BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN MISUNDERSTANDINGS OVER OUR INTENTIONS IN THIS DIALOGUE.
DEV-MUC3-0308	SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE -- SMUGGLING CAN BE HELD IN CHECK ONLY WITH MEASURES SUCH AS THESE. WE HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO TAKE THE SEVEREST ACTIONS AGAINST THOSE WHO SMUGGLE MERCHANDISE INTO OUR COUNTRY. AN INVESTIGATION IS WELL UNDER WAY INTO A CORPORATION WHICH HAS BEEN SMUGGLING MERCHANDISE INTO OUR COUNTRY. THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS WILL SOON BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW. WE WANT TO WARN ALL THOSE WHO SOMEHOW HAVE SMUGGLED OR WHO ARE PLANNING TO SMUGGLE THAT THEY SHOULD STOP THIS ACTIVITY. WE BELIEVE THAT SMUGGLING CONSTITUTES CORRUPTION AND THAT CORRUPTION IS A CRIME OF HIGH TREASON. WE CANNOT ALLOW CORRUPTION IN OUR COUNTRY. WE WILL TAKE HARSH ACTIONS AGAINST EVERY TYPE OF CORRUPTION, INCLUDING SMUGGLING. I AM ASKING THOSE WHO MIGHT BE APPROACHED BY UNSCRUPULOUS INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE IN THEIR POSSESSION SMUGGLED GOODS TO REFRAIN FROM PURCHASING THOSE PRODUCTS. LET US NOT PROMOTE SMUGGLING. I AM ASKING ALL GOOD SALVADORAN BUSINESSMEN NOT TO PURCHASE ANY SMUGGLED GOODS. SMUGGLING CONSTITUTES AN ATTACK AGAINST OUR HOMELAND AND ENCOURAGES CORRUPTION, WHICH MUST BE ERADICATED FROM OUR COUNTRY. REGARDING OUR FISCAL POLICY, WE MUST TRY TO DETERMINE WAYS TO MORE DIRECTLY MAKE UP FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REVENUE AND DISBURSEMENTS IN THE COUNTRY. WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN BRIDGE THIS FISCAL DEFICIT IN TWO WAYS -- WE MUST EITHER INCREASE OUR REVENUE OR LOWER OUR DISBURSEMENTS. THIS GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY TAKEN AUSTERITY MEASURES REGARDING THE LATTER. THE GOVERNMENT HAS DETERMINED NOT ONLY TO MAINTAIN EXPENDITURES AT THE CURRENT LEVEL, BUT TO REDUCE THEM BY 15 PERCENT. WE WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT OUR GOVERNMENT'S AUSTERITY MEASURES MUST BE GENUINE AND SHOULD BE AIMED AT MAKING MORE EFFICIENT USE OF SCANT RESOURCES. THIS IS WHY WE ARE ASKING PUBLIC EMPLOYEES TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT IS TO BE MORE EFFICIENT, THE GOVERNMENT MUST PROVIDE BETTER SERVICES FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. AFTER ALL, IT IS THE PEOPLE WHO PAY OUR SALARIES AND PROVIDE THE REVENUE THAT ALLOWS THE GOVERNMENT TO OPERATE. WE MUST SPEND OUR MONEY WISELY. ALL PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES MUST GUARD AGAINST CORRUPTION. WE MUST TAKE PAINS TO SERVE THE POPULATION AND TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICES THAT THE PEOPLE ARE RECEIVING AND DESERVE. ONLY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IS RUN EFFICIENTLY, WHEN ITS ACTIONS ARE CRYSTAL CLEAR, WHEN THE GOVERNMENT RIDS ITSELF OF CORRUPTION, AND WHEN THE MONEY THAT THE TAXPAYERS PAY IS USED FOR THE GOOD OF THE PEOPLE, WILL WE BE ABLE TO ELICIT A POSITIVE REACTION FROM THE TAXPAYERS. THEY HAVE TO PAY TAXES. WHEN TAXES ARE SQUANDERED, MISUSED, OR STOLEN, NO ONE WILL PAY THEM WILLINGLY. IF WE, AS THE GOVERNMENT, ACT HONESTLY, SERVE THE NATION WELL, AND IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS TO BENEFIT THE MAJORITY, ONLY DISLOYAL SALVADORANS WILL BE UNWILLING TO PAY TAXES.
DEV-MUC3-0309	SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE -- SECOND, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S HEALTH. WE BELIEVE THAT IN THE VERY SHORT TERM, WE HAD TO SUPPLY ALL THE HEALTH FACILITIES AND HOSPITALS WITH AT LEAST THE MOST URGENTLY NEEDED MEDICINES FOR THE PEOPLE. WE HAVE ALLOTTED 17 MILLION COLONS FOR THE HEALTH MINISTRY FOR THE PURCHASE OF THE MOST URGENTLY NEEDED MEDICINES AND FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF THIS MEDICINE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY SO THAT THE POOR WILL RECEIVE THE EFFICIENT HEALTH SERVICES THAT THE GOVERNMENT MUST PROVIDE. THE EDUCATION MINISTRY HAS BEEN ASKED TO GIVE STUDENTS THE MATERIALS THEY NEED TO PURSUE THEIR STUDIES. A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY HAS BEEN ALLOTTED FOR THE PURCHASE OF EQUIPMENT NEEDED BY THE SCHOOLS. WHEN THE 1990 SCHOOL YEAR BEGINS, WE MUST BE PREPARED TO PROVIDE THE SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS WITH THE MATERIAL THEY NEED. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO BEGIN, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, REPAIRING THE STREETS AND ROADS. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE CAN SEE THAT THIS IS ALREADY BEING DONE. FINALLY, LOW-INCOME HOUSING. NEXT WEEK THE PUBLIC WORKS MINISTER WILL ANNOUNCE THE LOW-INCOME HOUSING PLAN, AND HE WILL EXPLAIN HOW WE WILL HELP LOW-INCOME FAMILIES BUY HOMES. THIS WILL BE DONE THROUGH A SUBSIDY PLAN ENSURING THAT LOW-INCOME GROUPS WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY STEEP PAYMENTS AND WILL HAVE MONEY LEFT OVER FOR FOOD AND OTHER BASIC NECESSITIES. WE HAVE ALREADY DRAFTED A SOCIAL EMERGENCY PLAN. THIS PLAN WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN SEPTEMBER, AND ITS FIRST PHASE WILL BE CARRIED OUT IN THE HIGHLY POPULATED URBAN AREAS. THE PLAN WILL BENEFIT APPROXIMATELY 200 COMMUNITIES AND, AS OF NOW, I ASK THE MAYORS FOR THEIR HELP, BECAUSE WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS. THIS FIRST PHASE WILL BE AIMED AT PROVIDING LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES WITH PUBLIC UTILITIES. WE WILL PROVIDE THEM WITH ELECTRICITY AND RUNNING WATER, WE WILL BUILD SEWER SYSTEMS, AND WE WILL HELP THEM IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH AND NUTRITION. AMID THE CRISIS WE ARE EXPERIENCING, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THE SMALL - SCALE BUSINESSMEN IN THESE COMMUNITIES. WE WILL ORGANIZE A LOAN SYSTEM FOR SMALL - SIZE BUSINESSES FOR DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES. I REPEAT: THIS SOCIAL EMERGENCY PLAN WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN SEPTEMBER. IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, WE WILL BEGIN TO SEEK THE COOPERATION OF THOSE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS THAT WILL BE INVOLVED IN THE PLAN. THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE MUST ALL STRUGGLE FOR, AND THAT IS TO ABOLISH UNEMPLOYMENT. WE MUST STRUGGLE SO THAT EVERY SALVADORAN WILL HAVE THE CHANCE TO EARN AN HONEST LIVING. WE THEREFORE WISH TO LAUNCH AN OFFENSIVE AGAINST UNEMPLOYMENT. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE BEST WAY TO FIGHT VIOLENCE IS THROUGH EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, SO THAT THE PEOPLE WILL NOT FIND THEMSELVES IN THE SITUATION WHERE THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY MUST COMMIT CRIMES TO SURVIVE OR THAT THEY MUST GET INVOLVED IN THE TYPE OF VIOLENCE SPONSORED BY THE FMLN TERRORISTS. THEREFORE, IN SEPTEMBER, WE WILL ALSO IMPLEMENT AN EMERGENCY PLAN TO GENERATE EMPLOYMENT. THIS PLAN HAS SOME SPECIFIC GOALS: FIRST, TO PROVIDE A BASIC JOB FOR THOSE PERSONS WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED OR UNDEREMPLOYED. OUR GOAL IS TO CREATE 20,000 JOBS PER MONTH FOR THESE PEOPLE. THIS PLAN WILL BE DRAFTED IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, AND WE WILL IMPLEMENT IT DURING THOSE MONTHS WHEN THERE IS USUALLY A DROP IN EMPLOYMENT. I MUST STRESS THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN DURING THE SOWING AND HARVEST SEASONS, BECAUSE DURING THOSE SEASONS THERE IS AN OVERABUNDANCE OF JOBS.
DEV-MUC3-0310	SAN SALVADOR, 22 JUL 89 -- THE SALVADORAN NATIONAL POLICE REPORTED THIS MORNING THAT UNIDENTIFIED MEN SET OFF BOMBS AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN JOSE SIMEON CANAS UNIVERSITY, UCA, LOCATED IN SOUTHWESTERN SAN SALVADOR. ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE AT 0200. ONE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE, ONE BUS, AND ONE ELECTRICAL TRANSFORMER WERE DAMAGED AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION OF AT LEAST FOUR BOMBS THAT WENT OFF INSIDE THE UCA CAMPUS. THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ALWAYS CONDEMNED THIS KIND OF ATTACK, WHICH IS USUALLY CARRIED OUT BY CERTAIN GROUPS THAT OPPOSE PEACE. THE ARMED FORCES BELIEVE THAT SUCH ATTACKS ARE NOT THE WAY TO SOLVE THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PROBLEMS. IN ADDITION, THESE VIOLENT ACTIONS ONLY CONFUSE THE PUBLIC, BECAUSE UNSCRUPULOUS PEOPLE ALWAYS BLAME THE ARMY FOR ANY SUCH ACTION, WITHOUT FIRST CONDUCTING AN IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION OF THE ORIGIN OF THE ATTACKS. THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ALWAYS REITERATED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ENSURE RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROPERTY, AND THE LIFE AND SAFETY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. THEREFORE, FROM THIS VERY MOMENT, THE ARMED FORCES REJECT ANY ACCUSATION IMPLICATING THEM IN THE ATTACK AGAINST UCA, WHICH TOOK PLACE EARLY THIS MORNING.
DEV-MUC3-0311	SAN SALVADOR, 25 JUL 89 -- DEAR PEASANT FRIENDS: FROM THE VERY 1ST DAY OF OUR ADMINISTRATION, WE HAVE PLEDGED OUR FULL COMMITMENT TO NATIONAL PROGRAMS AND HAVE SAID THAT "AT NO TIME AND FOR NO REASON WILL WE FORGET THE MANY NEEDY PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY -- THAT IS, THE NOBLE AND LONG-SUFFERING PEASANTS, WHO ARE THE MAIN VICTIMS OF TERRORIST VIOLENCE." THIS CEREMONY REAFFIRMS OUR GOVERNMENT'S COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE AGRARIAN REFORM. WE WANT YOU TO REALIZE THE SERIOUSNESS OF OUR WORDS THROUGH OUR DEEDS. THIS PRESENTATION OF 8,000 PERMANENT LAND TITLE DEEDS TO THE BENEFICIARIES OF DECREE 207 -- THROUGH THE NATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION FOR AGRICULTURAL LANDS -- REFLECTS OUR OBJECTIVES. WE HAVE CATEGORICALLY SAID THAT WE WILL NOT TURN BACK THE AGRARIAN REFORM PROCESS. QUITE TO THE CONTRARY, WE WANT TO FULLY SUPPORT IT IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE THAT PEASANTS IN AREAS AFFECTED BY THE AGRARIAN REFORM ARE FREE TO CHOOSE THE KIND OF PROPERTY OWNERSHIP THAT BEST SUITS THEIR NEEDS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GREAT FREEDOMS GUARANTEED IN THE CONSTITUTION AND LAWS OF THE REPUBLIC. OUR GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO WORK HARD TO ENSURE THAT OUR BROTHER PEASANTS ARE INDEED BENEFITED BY THE AGRARIAN REFORM AND THAT THEY WILL NOT BE USED AS A DEMAGOGICAL BANNER AT THE SERVICE OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGY, AS WAS THE CASE UNTIL RECENTLY. WE WANT PEASANTS' WELFARE TO BE THE OBJECTIVE OF OUR AGRARIAN REFORM; WE WANT AGRARIAN REFORM TO DEVELOP WITHIN A LEGAL, HONEST, AND PATRIOTIC FRAMEWORK. WE ARE AGAINST THE DEMAGOGUERY OF STATIC PATERNALISM, BECAUSE WE WANT PEASANTS TO DETERMINE THEIR OWN FATE, TO TRULY PARTICIPATE IN THEIR PRODUCTION UNITS' DECISIONMAKING PROCESS, IN THE MARKETING OF THEIR PRODUCTS, AND IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF REVENUE. IT IS NEITHER FAIR NOR CORRECT, AS HAS BEEN THE CASE IN THE PAST, TO BENEFIT OFFICE WORKERS, WHO HAVE NEVER SWEATED IN THE FIELDS UNDER THE AGRARIAN REFORM, WHEN YOU -- THE PEASANTS -- ARE NOW FACING DEBTS AND ARE WORSE OFF THAN BEFORE YOU OWNED LAND. OUR GOVERNMENT AND YOU WILL GRADUALLY CHANGE THIS SITUATION TO ENSURE THAT YOU WILL ENTHUSIASTICALLY WORK YOUR LAND, KNOWING THAT THE FRUIT OF YOUR LABOR WILL DIRECTLY BENEFIT YOUR FAMILIES. WE ARE SURE THAT WITH EFFICIENT ORGANIZATION, PROMPT CREDIT, ADEQUATE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, AND THE HARDWORKING LEGACY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE WILL TURN THE AGRARIAN REFORM INTO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, WHICH WILL BENEFIT ALL SALVADORANS BY PROMOTING PRODUCTION AND PRODUCTIVITY. DEAR PEASANTS: WE WISH TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TELL YOU THAT OUR GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO WORK WITH YOU. THROUGH THE RELEVANT ORGANIZATIONS, THE GOVERNMENT WILL IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS TO COMPLETELY UPGRADE THE SALVADORAN PEASANTS' CONDITIONS. THROUGH FINATA, WE WILL CONTINUE TO FINANCE THE ACQUISITION OF MORE LAND FOR DISTRIBUTION AMONG THOUSANDS OF PEASANT FAMILIES. DEAR FRIENDS: OUR GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO ACHIEVE PEACE, BECAUSE WE ARE AWARE THAT THE FMLN'S TERRORIST VIOLENCE DISTURBS THE CALM AND NORMAL PROCEDURE OF RURAL ACTIVITIES; WE REALIZE THAT WE MUST END THE VIOLENCE SO THAT WE CAN ALL GO BACK TO WORK AND BRING ABOUT A NATIONAL RECOVERY. PEASANTS HAVE SUFFERED THE MOST THROUGHOUT THE CONFLICT UNLEASHED BY THE TERRORIST MARXIST-LENINIST GROUPS, AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE TIME HAS COME TO SEEK THE PEACE THAT WE ALL WANT IN ORDER TO RESTORE SOCIAL HARMONY, MUTUAL RESPECT, AND FRATERNAL LOVE AMONG ALL SALVADORANS WITHOUT EXCEPTION. ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC, WE HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY PLEASED TO PRESENT THESE PERMANENT LAND TITLE DEEDS TO THE BENEFICIARIES OF DECREE 207. WE CONGRATULATE AND INVITE YOU TO CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER TO HELP THE FATHERLAND RECOVER FROM THE CRISIS AND TO BUILD FOR OUR CHILDREN AND ALL SALVADORANS A FUTURE OF PEACE, JUSTICE, LIBERTY, AND PROGRESS.
DEV-MUC3-0312	LIMA, 28 JUL 89 -- LIMA TELEVISION PERUANA NETWORK IN SPANISH 1733 GMT ON 28 JULY, CONTINUING ITS LIVE COVERAGE OF FESTIVITIES ON THE OCCASION OF PERUVIAN NATIONAL DAY, BROADCASTS A SPEECH TO THE NATION BY PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA LIVE FROM THE NATIONAL CONGRESS CHAMBER IN LIMA. PRESIDENT GARCIA NOTES THAT HIS PRESIDENCY HAS BEEN A TESTIMONY OF FAITH TO DEMOCRACY BASED ON THE PERUVIAN CONSTITUTION, WHICH PROVIDES THE FRAMEWORK FOR GOVERNING A FREE PERU. NOTING THAT THIS SPEECH IS HIS LAST MESSAGE TO THE COUNTRY FROM CONGRESS, GARCIA BEGINS TO COMMENT ON THE ACHIEVEMENTS AND EVENTS OF HIS LAST YEAR IN OFFICE. AFTER STRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF DEMOCRACY AND EDUCATION TO OVERCOME PROBLEMS OF THE ECONOMY AND OF VIOLENCE, GARCIA DECLARES: "I AM HEREBY CALL FOR GENERAL ELECTIONS TO CHOOSE PRESIDENT AND THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ON 8 APRIL 1990. APPLAUSE "I WOULD LIKE TO REMARK THAT I AM A POLITICIAN, THAT I PARTICIPATE IN DEBATES, AND THAT MY LIFE IS INDEBTED TO THE APRA MOVEMENT. YET AS PRESIDENT I HAVE A MAJOR SACRED MISSION, THAT OF GUARANTEEING THAT THE ELECTIONS WILL BE ABSOLUTELY FAIR AND CLEAN." GARCIA NOTES THAT THE ELECTORAL AUTHORITIES WILL BE REPLACED AND THAT THE NATIONAL MEDIA ARE FROM THIS MOMENT ON PLACED AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE CANDIDATES. HE CALLS ON THE ARMED FORCES TO DEFEND DEMOCRACY. THE PRESIDENT CALLS ON PERUVIAN YOUTH TO ESCHEW VIOLENCE IN FAVOR OF EDUCATION AND WORKING TOWARD PROMOTING DEMOCRACY. GARCIA THEN TURNS HIS ATTENTION TO THE QUESTION OF REGIONALIZATION, NOTING THAT MANY GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS ARE BEING REORGANIZED TO BETTER SERVE THE PEOPLE. WHEN EACH REGION HAS ITS OWN ELECTED OFFICIALS, HE SAYS, THE PEOPLE WILL EXERT MORE CONTROL OVER OFFICIALS' ACTIVITIES, AND CORRUPTION WILL BE REDUCED. PERU WILL NOT NEED TO ACCEPT INTERNATIONAL SOLUTIONS TO ITS NATIONAL PROBLEMS. AFTER CALLING ON THE JUSTICE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO IMPROVE ITS ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, GARCIA ANNOUNCES: "I HEREBY CALL ELECTIONS -- FOLLOWING A CONSULTATION WITH THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COURT -- FOR REGIONAL GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GRAU REGION, CREATED ON 1 MARCH 1988, MADE UP OF THE FOLLOWING PROVINCES: TUMBES, CONTRALMIRANTE VILLAR, ZARUMILLA, HUANCABAMBA, MORROPON, PAITA, SULLANA, TALARA, AYABACA, AND PIURA ON 12 NOVEMBER 1989." GARCIA ALSO ISSUES AN OFFICIAL CALL FOR 12 NOVEMBER ELECTIONS IN THE AMAZONAS, AREQUIPA, AND MOQUEGUA-TACNA-PUNO REGIONS. AT 1801 GMT GARCIA BEGINS TO SPEAK ON THE SUBJECT OF TERRORISM AND VIOLENCE. HE CALLS ON THE PEOPLE AS WELL AS ALL POLTIICAL PARTIES TO SUPPORT THE ARMED FORCES IN PUTTING AN END TO VIOLENCE. HE PROPOSES THAT TERRORISTS BE TRIED IN MILITARY COURTS. ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS IN PERU, PRESIDENT GARCIA REITERATES THAT HIS GOVERNMENT IS PROMOTING AN INCREASE IN FOREIGN RESERVES AS WELL AS REACTIVATING THE PRODUCTION SECTOR. HE NOTES THE IMPORTANCE OF FURTHER DEVELOPING AGRICULTURE AND PETROLEUM. HE REVIEWS THE PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS, INCLUDING IRRIGATION AND RURAL ELECTRICIFICATION WORKS, THAT HAVE BEEN INITIATED OR COMPLETED DURING HIS PRESIDENCY. GARCIA CALLS ON THE PEOPLE NOT TO BE DEFEATED BY TERRORISM, SENSATIONALISM, OR PESSIMISM. NOTING THAT THE PEOPLE ARE PERU'S MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE, THE PRESIDENT CALLS FOR IMPROVING THE SOCIAL WELFARE SECTOR. HE DENIES THE RUMOR THAT SECTOR WILL BE PRIVATIZED. GARCIA ENDS HIS SPEECH AT 1851 GMT.
DEV-MUC3-0313	BUENOS AIRES, 28 JUL 89 -- GOOD EVENING LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. TODAY WE WILL DISCUSS THE FOREIGN DEBT PROBLEM. THIS SUBJECT COULD PERHAPS SEEM A BIT OUT PLACE AT A TIME WHEN MORE TROUBLESOME MATTERS AFFECT ALL ARGENTINE FAMILIES, SUCH AS HIGH PUBLIC UTILITY RATES, PRICES, CONTROLS, DIFFICULTIES, ETC. HOWEVER, WE MUST ATTEND TO THE FOREIGN DEBT PROBLEM BECAUSE MOST OUR DIFFICULTIES COME FROM IT. OF WHAT DOES THIS PROBLEM CONSIST? WE CURRENTLY OWE $64 BILLION. THIS REPRESENTS A BURDEN OF $6 BILLION YEARLY IN INTEREST PAYMENTS. SINCE ARGENTINA IS CURRENTLY EXPORTING $9 BILLION ANNUALLY, AND IF WE PAID $6 BILLION IN INTEREST, WE WOULD ONLY HAVE $3 BILLION LEFT ANNUALLY TO ATTEND TO ALL OUR NATIONAL NEEDS, THAT IS, THE NEEDS OF INDUSTRY, COMMERCE, ETC. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY, AND WE CANNOT PAY $6 BILLION IN INTEREST EACH YEAR WITH $9 BILLION WORTH OF ANNUAL EXPORTS. THIS IS NOT NEW. THIS IS A HEAVY INHERITANCE, WHICH ORIGINATED NOT IN THE RECENT PAST BUT MORE THAN 10 YEARS AGO. WHEN MARTINEZ DE HOZ BECAME ECONOMY MINISTER , THE FOREIGN DEBT AMOUNTED TO $9 BILLION. WHEN HE CONCLUDED HIS TERM, THE DEBT AMOUNTED TO $29 BILLION. THE MILITARY GOVERNMENTS THAT CAME AFTER HIM DRAGGED THE DEBT ALONG AND INCREASED IT TO $44 BILLION WHICH THEY PASSED TO PRESIDENT ALFONSIN. ALFONSIN'S ADMINISTRATION INCREASED THE DEBT BY AN ADDITIONAL $20 BILLION. SO TODAY OUR DEBT AMOUNTS TO $64 BILLION. THIS IS NOT ALL. WE CEASED HONORING OUR COMMITMENTS ABROAD. WE HAVE NOT EVEN PAID INTEREST SINCE APRIL LAST YEAR. WE HAVE ONLY MADE TOKEN PAYMENTS. THIS REFUTES THE IDEAS OF THOSE WHO SAY: LET US STOP PAYING OUR DEBT AND USE THE RESOURCES TO MAKE THE COUNTRY GROW. WE ARE NOT PAYING ANYTHING. FOR MORE THAN A YEAR WE HAVE NOT BEEN PAYING ANYTHING, AND NOT ONLY HAS THE ECONOMY NOT GROWN, BUT IT SHRANK. ARGENTINA HAS AN EXTREMELY LOW CREDIT RATING. COUNTRIES ARE INTERNATIONALLY CLASSIFIED BY THEIR CREDIT, AND WE ARE IN ONE OF THE LOWEST CATEGORIES. OUR COMMERCIAL CREDIT IS ALSO BEING CURTAILED. COMMERCIAL CREDITS ARE THE ONES THAT ALLOW US TO IMPORT, EXPORT, AND MEET OUR DAILY NEEDS. WHEN THE NEW ADMINISTRATION ASSUMED POWER ON 8 APRIL 1989, THE CENTRAL BANK'S FOREIGN RESERVES WERE EXHAUSTED. THIS SITUATION CAN TURN INTO A CRISIS AT ANY MOMENT. WE CANNOT CONTINUE LIKE THIS. THE COMING OF THIS NEW GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAS BROUGHT ABOUT POSITIVE EXPECTATIONS AND HOPE, AND WHICH IS UNDERTAKING REMARKABLE CHANGES -- MAINLY CHANGES OF MENTALITY -- HAS STOPPED THE CRISIS FROM EXPLODING. BUT WE CANNOT REST ON OUR ACHIEVEMENTS. WE MUST FACE THIS PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY. OUR STARTING POINT IN CERTAINLY VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. OUR COUNTRY HAS NO PRESTIGE ABROAD; WE HAVE LOST OUR CREDIBILITY. NO ONE EVEN WANTS TO HEAR ABOUT ARGENTINA, OR AT LEAST ABOUT ITS DEBT. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS WE HAVE NOT HONORED ANY OF OUR COMMIETMENTS. EVERY TIME WE SIGNED A LETTER OF INTENT WITH THE IMF, WE KNEW THAT WE COULD NOT COMPLY WITH IT. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL LETTERS OF INTENT WE DID NOT COMPLY WITH. WHAT POLICY WILL WE FOLLOW IN THE FUTURE? THE PRESIDENT DEFINED IT IN HIS MESSAGE TO CONGRESS ON 8 JULY. HE SAID WE HAVE A HEAVY BURDEN, A DEBT THAT WAS UNWISELY CONTRACTED, BUT IT IS A COMMITMENT OF HONOR. HE USED WORDS THAT WERE COMMON IN ARGENTINA IN THE PAST. IT WAS ONCE SAID: WE WILL COMPLY WITH OUR COMMITMENTS, EVEN AT THE COST OF HUNGER AND THIRST FOR THE ARGENTINE PEOPLE. THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE HIS OWN COMMITMENT ON THIS SUBJECT. WE WILL PAY ACCORDING TO THE CAPABILITY OF THE NATION, AND THE ONLY THING WE REQUIRE IS A BIT OF TIME AND, OF COURSE, FLEXIBILITY ON THE PART OF OUR CREDITORS. IF WE DID NOT HONOR OUR COMMITMENTS, IF WE HAD SAID WE ARE NOT GOING TO PAY, THE SITUATION IN OUR COUNTRY WOULD BE DRAMATICALLY WORSE. WE WOULD BE ISOLATED. WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN CREDITS, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FOREIGN CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. IN A WORD, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE THE REST OF THE WORLD, WHICH IS QUICKLY EXPANDING AND PROGRESSING. WE WOULD BE MUCH MORE BACKWARD THAN WE ARE TODAY. THEREFORE THERE IS REALLY NO QUESTION OF PAYING OR NOT PAYING. THE HONOR OF THE COUNTRY IS AT STAKE. WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE FOREIGN DEBT IN OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY? YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE EVERYTHING NECESSARY. WE HAVE NATURAL RESOURCES, FOOD, ENERGY, FISHING, MINING, ETC. WE HAVE HUMAN RESOURCES. YOU KNOW THAT WHEN ARGENTINES WORK ABROAD THEY ARE EFFICIENT AND THEY ARE RECOGNIZED AS SUCH. WE HAVE NO INTERNAL RELIGIOUS, RACIAL, OR INDIAN PROBLEMS, NOT EVEN PROBLEMS WITH OUR NEIGHBORS. WHAT ARE WE MISSING? WHY ARE WE WHERE WE ARE, AND WHY CAN'T WE SURVIVE? WE NEED TWO THINGS: FIRST, WE NEED AN APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC ORDER. WE LIVE IN A DEEP ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DISORDER. SECOND, WE NEED CAPITAL. CAPITAL IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. I SAID THAT I WAS GOING TO DISCUSS THE SAVINGS IN ARGENTINA THAT CAN BE TAPPED. FOR YEARS, ARGENTINA'S SAVINGS HAVE BEEN CONSTANTLY PUNISHED BY GOVERNMENT ACTIONS, SUCH AS ABUSIVE TAXES, MANDATORY SAVINGS, AND, ABOVE ALL, THE GREAT EROSION CAUSED BY INFLATION THAT DESTROYS THE CURRENCY. JUST REMEMBER HOW MANY TIMES WE HAVE CHANGED OUR CURRENCY. TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THESE LOSSES, WHAT DID SAVERS DO? THEY EITHER TOOK THEIR MONEY ABROAD OR HID IT UNDER THEIR MATTRESSES. WE WILL FOCUS TODAY ON THE MONEY UNDER THE MATTRESSES, ALTHOUGH WHAT I WILL SAY NOW WILL ALSO BE RELEVANT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE THEIR SAVINGS ABROAD. ACCORDING TO CALCULATIONS, THERE ARE SMALL, MEDIUM, AND LARGE SAVINGS ADDING UP TO NEARLY $5 BILLION IN THE COUNTRY. A PERSON WAS ASSAULTED IN CORDOBA THE OTHER DAY AND $250,000 WAS FOUND IN HIS MATTRESS. MONEY UNDER THE MATTRESS IS AT RISK, DOES NOT ACCRUE INTEREST, DOES NOT WORK FOR THE COUNTRY, AND DOES NOT GIVE ANY BENEFIT TO THE OWNERS NOR THE COUNTRY. SOME OF OUR HOPE LIES IN THESE SAVINGS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY, BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT A RESERVE THAT WE HAVE ON HAND. WE ARE NOT BANKRUPT. WE HAVE THOSE RESERVES, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT WORKING. THE SECRET IS TO USE THEM FOR THE COUNTRY'S BENEFIT. ARGENTINA'S PROBLEMS CAN BE RESOLVED IF THESE SAVINGS ARE USED. NOW, TO TAP INTO THESE SAVINGS, THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE A DECISION, AND THE CENTRAL BANK HAS ALREADY TRANSLATED IT INTO A RESOLUTION. INTO BANKS HERE IN THE COUNTRY IN DOLLARS, YEN, DEUTSCHE MARKS, OR ANY OTHER CURRENCY. THEY WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE WITHDRAWALS WHENEVER THEY WANT IN THE SAME CURRENCY IN WHICH THEIR SAVINGS WERE DEPOSITED. NOBODY WILL BE ALLOWED TO TOUCH THEM. THIS WILL BE REINFORCED BY A LAW GRANTING SAVERS THE MAXIMUM GUARANTEE THAT NO PUBLIC POWER CAN INTERVENE IN THOSE SAVINGS; THAT IS, THERE WILL BE A FINANCIAL SYSTEM INTO WHICH THOSE SAVINGS, IN ANY CURRENCY, CAN BE PLACED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COUNTRY AND, OF COURSE, THE DEPOSITOR. ANYBODY WHO HAS $10,000 UNDER HIS MATTRESS CAN TAKE IT OUT, GO TO THE BANK, AND, UNDER THE GUARANTEE OF THE BANK -- NOT THE CENTRAL BANK OR THE NATION, WHICH HAVE BEEN DISCREDITED -- THE MONEY WILL BE AT HIS DISPOSAL AT ANY TIME. THE BANK WILL LEND THE MONEY FOR EXPORT OPERATIONS AND FOR MOVING THE COUNTRY'S WEALTH. NEW BLOOD WILL THUS HAVE BEEN INJECTED INTO THE ARGENTINE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. I POINT OUT THAT THE LAW WILL GIVE MAXIMUM GUARANTEES. NO PUBLIC POWER WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEIZE THE SAVINGS, NOR FREEZE THEM, NOR POSTPONE THEIR WITHDRAWAL. THESE ARE THE MAXIMUM GUARANTEES THAT CAN BE GIVEN; MORE IS IMPOSSIBLE. EACH ARGENTINE MUST NOW THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS. IT HAS A CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE, BECAUSE IT INJECTS BLOOD INTO THE SOCIAL BODY; IT MOVES THE COUNTRY. MOREOVER, FROM THE MORAL STANDPOINT, IF WE DO NOT DO THIS, HOW CAN WE GO ABROAD AND ASK FOREIGNERS TO INVEST IN ARGENTINA -- TO BRING THEIR MONEY TO ARGENTINA -- IF AT THE SAME TIME I DO NOT INVEST HERE BECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE CONFIDENCE IN MY COUNTRY? THIS IS AN IMMORAL POSITION. IF WE MAKE THE INITIAL EFFORT AND DEPOSIT $2, 3 OR 4 BILLION IN THE COUNTRY, OUR NEGOTIATIONS ABROAD TAKE A NEW TWIST, BECAUSE WE CAN SAY THAT THE ARGENTINES HAVE MADE THE FIRST EFFORT. ALL THIS NATURALLY DEPENDS ON CONFIDENCE, AND CONFIDENCE IN TURN DEPENDS ON TAKING THIS FIRST STEP. THIS IS A RECIPROCAL EFFECT. TO CREATE CONFIDENCE, MEASURES SUCH AS THOSE ADOPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE CENTRAL BANK HAVE TO BE ADOPTED. THESE MEASURES CREATE CONFIDENCE, AND WITH CONFIDENCE THE COUNTRY WILL QUICKLY RECOVER. WE HAVE MANY OTHER THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THIS, BUT WITHIN THE LIMITATION OF TIME, WE CAN STOP HERE.
DEV-MUC3-0314	LIMA, 28 JUL 89 -- MR PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS, GENTLEMEN MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS: TEN YEARS AGO, THE MEMBERS OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY PRESIDED OVER BY HAYA DE LA TORRE, CALLING UP ON LORD GOD FOR STRENGTH AND IN KEEPING WITH THE POWERS VESTED IN US BY THE SOVEREIGN WILL OF THE PEOPLE, APPROVED THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTION. WE BELIEVE THAT THE HUMAN BEING COMES FIRST AND THAT ALL HONORABLE PEOPLE HAVE UNIVERSALLY VALID RIGHTS. THUS WE DECIDED TO WORK FOR A FREE AND JUST SOCIETY AND FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DEMOCRATIC STATE BASED ON POPULAR WILL AND ON THE FREE, PERIODIC CONSULTATION OF THIS WILL. WE BET ON CIVILIZED COEXISTENCE AS A WAY OF LAUNCHING A PROCESS BASED ON STABLE AND LEGITIMATE INSTITUTIONS. THE MOST IMPORTANT CONDITIONS, HOWEVER, WERE SET FORTH IN CHAPTER 1, WHICH RECOGNIZED THE INDIVIDUAL'S BASIC RIGHTS AND DUTIES FOR THE FREE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS PERSONALITY. OUR CONSTITUTION WAS A RESULT OF THE BALANCE ACHIEVED AMONG VARIOUS AND SOMETIMES ANTAGONISTIC POLITICAL FORCES. THUS, SOME OF ITS ECONOMIC ARTICLES MAY SEEM VAGUE. HOWEVER, UNDER THIS CONSTITUTION ANY IDEOLOGY CAN GOVERN THE COUNTRY AND MAKE CHANGES IN ANY DIRECTION WHATSOEVER, AS LONG AS THOSE FIRST CONDITIONS AGREED UPON BY CONSENSUS ARE RESPECTED. THIS IS THE LAST MESSAGE I WILL DELIVER TO CONGRESS AS PRESIDENT BEFORE I TURN THE PRESIDENCY OVER TO A CITIZEN ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE. I CANNOT FAIL TO EXPAND ON THE ACHIEVEMENTS MADE THIS YEAR, WHICH, HONESTLY SPEAKING ARE MUCH FEWER THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS. I AM DELIVERING A SUMMARY OF THESE ACHIEVEMENTS IN WRITING, AS ESTABLISH BY THE CONSTITUTION, FOR THE USE OF THE LEGISLATORS. IT IS A SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACHIEVEMENTS. IT IS NOW MORE IMPORTANT TO ME TO SAY THAT THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE GOVERNMENT IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WILL BE TO REAFFIRM THE SYSTEM OF DEMOCRATIC FREEDOM, WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SYSTEM PERU HAS. WITH THIS FREEDOM, EVEN THE MOST EXTREME POSITIONS CAN EXIST. THE REACTIONARY POSITIONS OF THE ULTRARIGHT AND RADICAL IDEOLOGIES CAN ALSO LIVE IN FREEDOM. VIOLENCE HAS LESS CHANCE OF DEVELOPING IN FREEDOM. THE NATION HAS MORE LEGITIMATE MEANS TO ERADICATE VIOLENCE UNDER FREEDOM. LIKE ANY OTHER CITIZEN, I ALSO BELIEVE THAT SOMETIMES DISAGREEMENTS, POLITICAL PARTIES, LAWS, AND SKILLFUL LEGAL PROCEDURES CAN OBSTRUCT MANY THINGS AND STOP DECISIONS. BUT THIS IS THE PRICE FOR A CIVILIZED LIFESTYLE. DEMOCRACY DOES NOT HAVE THE FORTHRIGHTNESS OF A DICTATORSHIP. DEMOCRACY IS SLOWER, BUT DEMANDS MORE FIRMNESS, MORE CONVICTION, MORE PATIENCE. DEMOCRACY DEMANDS THE GRADUAL EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE; THIS TAKES A LONG TIME. I AM SAYING THIS BECAUSE THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN SUFFERING A DRAMATIC ECONOMIC CRISIS SINCE SEPTEMBER 1988, AND IT HAS BEEN NECESSARY TO MAKE HARSH CHANGES AT A TIME WHEN VIOLENCE HAS SEEMED TO INCREASE. WE HEARD SOME PEOPLE WHO HAD LOST THEIR COOL DEMANDING AN INTERRUPTION OF OUR DEMOCRACY. THEY CALLED FOR A SHORTER GOVERNMENT TERM. THEY ALSO SAID THAT THE COUNTRY COULD DEFEAT THE TERRORIST VIOLENCE AND THE ECONOMIC CRISIS BY RESTRICTING FREEDOM AND ESTABLISHING AN AUTHORITARIAN REGIME. I BELIEVE THAT THOSE WERE IMMATURE VOICES, DECEITFUL TEMPTATIONS. MANY OF THOSE VOICES UNFORTUNATELY CAME FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE MORE WEALTH. BY DOING THIS THEY HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY ARE NOT YET READY TO COEXIST DEMOCRATICALLY AND TO ACCEPT THAT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC TENSIONS, EVEN AT THE WORSE TIMES, SHOULD BE HANDLED WITH SERENITY AND PATIENCE. A DICTATORSHIP THAT VIOLATES LEGAL PROCEDURES WILL ONLY HELP TO INCREASE VIOLENCE AND LEGITIMATE INSURGENCY, AND WOULD STIMULATE THE CREATION OF NEW SUBVERSIVE GROUPS. A DICTATORSHIP CANNOT SOLVE THE ECONOMIC CRISIS. IT WOULD ONLY HAVE LIMITED POWER AND WOULD IMPOSE A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE THAT WOULD LEAD NOWHERE. I AM REFERRING TO THIS ISSUE BECAUSE THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WILL BE A CRUCIAL PERIOD. I CALL ON THE PERUVIAN PEOPLE TO LOOK AT THE FUTURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY BY REALIZING THAT IN A DEMOCRACY THE PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED WITH MORE DEMOCRACY, WITH MORE FREEDOM, AND WITH MORE PARTICIPATION. TO HAVE DEMOCRACY, ONE MUST HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF PATIENCE. THIS IS MY LAST MESSAGE TO CONGRESS. I AM COMMITTED TO MORE FREEDOM AND MORE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, WHICH SOMETIMES WE DOUBT BECAUSE OF EXCESSES. BUT FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION WILL ALWAYS BE POSITIVE, BECAUSE WITHOUT FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION ABUSE WILL PREVAIL.
DEV-MUC3-0315	SAN SALVADOR, 29 JUL 89 -- THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION MARTI FRONT TODAY CLAIMED IT DOWNED TWO HELICOPTERS AND ALSO CHARGED SOME HOUSES WERE DESTROYED BY MILITARY AIRCRAFT IN NORTHERN MORAZAN DEPARTMENT.

DEV-MUC3-0316	BOGOTA, 31 JUL 89 -- THE AUTHORITIES HAVE REPORTED THAT IN THE PAST FEW HOURS THE CAMILIST UNION OF THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION BLEW UP A SECTION OF THE PEREIRA-CARTAGO PIPELINE, CAUSING MAJOR STRUCTURAL DAMAGE BUT LEAVING NO CASUALTIES. THE COLOMBIAN PETROLEUM ENTERPRISE, ECOPETROL, REPORTED THAT THE EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE AT THE 20 KM MARKER OF THE PIPELINE, ONLY 7 KM FROM CARTAGO, IN PEREIRA JURISDICTION. THE SUBVERSIVES PERPETRATED THIS ACTION ON THE SOTARA RANCH OWNED BY HERNANDO ROJAS. UC-ELN MEMBERS DETONATED A POWERFUL DYNAMITE CHARGE CAUSING HEAVY DAMAGE TO THE PIPELINE. THE AUTHORITIES, WHO REPORTED A CONSIDERABLE FUEL SPILL AND EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE RANCH, IMMEDIATELY ORDERED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A PLAN TO COUNTER THE SUBVERSIVES' ACTION.

DEV-MUC3-0317	GUATEMALA CITY, 1 AUG 89 -- GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO SAID TODAY THAT DANILO BARILLAS, FORMER AMBASSADOR AND LEADER OF THE RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY , WAS THE "VICTIM OF THE POLITICAL INTOLERANCE OF GROUPS WHO DO NOT WANT TO LIVE IN DEMOCRACY." IN STATEMENTS TO NEWSMEN, CEREZO SAID THAT THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR KILLING BARILLAS "ARE EXTREME RIGHTIST GROUPS SEEKING TO DESTABILIZE THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS BEGUN ON 14 JANUARY 1986," AFTER 2 DECADES OF MILITARY REGIMES. POLICE SOURCES REPORTED THAT BARILLAS, AMBASSADOR TO SPAIN DURING THE FIRST 2 YEARS OF CEREZO'S ADMINISTRATION, WHICH BEGAN IN 1986, WAS GUNNED DOWN BY UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS AS HE WAS RETURNING TO HIS HOME IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE CAPITAL AFTER TAKING ONE OF HIS DAUGHTERS TO A NEARBY BUS STOP. OFFICIAL REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE ATTACKERS, WHO WERE TRAVELING IN TWO VEHICLES WITH TINTED WINDOWS, HAD BEEN WAITING FOR BARILLAS SINCE VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING. DE POLITICAL LEADER MANAGED TO AVOID THE FIRST SHOTS THAT WERE FIRED AT HIM AND TOOK REFUGE UNDER A PARKED CAR, WHERE THE ASSAILANTS PUMPED 6 ROUNDS INTO HIM. BARILLAS, 50, WAS SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PDC FROM 1970 TO 1974. PRESIDENT CEREZO AND ALFONSO CABRERA, PDC SECRETARY AND PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL FOR THAT PARTY, WENT TO BARILLAS' HOME WHERE THEY VEHEMENTLY CONDEMNED THE CRIME. CABRERA TERMED THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE KILLING "COWARDS," AND SAID THAT THE CRIME IS PART OF A TERRORIST WAVE THAT HAS GRIPPED GUATEMALA FOR OVER 15 DAYS. BARILLAS WAS A MEMBER OF THE GUATEMALAN DELEGATION THAT PARTICIPATED IN A MEETING WITH LEADERS OF THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY HELD IN MADRID, SPAIN, IN OCTOBER 1987, WHEN HE WAS AMBASSADOR TO THAT EUROPEAN COUNTRY. AFTER LEAVING THAT POST LAST YEAR HE WAS APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT CEREZO AS DIRECTOR OF THE SO-CALLED "METROPOLITAN DEVELOPMENT COUNCILS," WHICH PROVIDE REFUGE FOR PEASANTS AFFECTED BY THE COUNTERINSURGENCY STRUGGLE.

AS WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THROUGH OUR URBAN OPERATION, THE PLAN IS NOT AGAINST THE FMLN , BUT AGAINST ALL NATIONAL SECTORS WITH THE AIM OF STIFLING ALL OPPOSITION TO THE ARENA'S PLANS OF PERMANENTLY PLACING IN POWER THE OLIGARCHIC MINORITY IT REPRESENTS. THE FMLN CALLS ON ALL NATIONAL SECTORS TO JOIN EFFORTS TO DEFEAT ARENA'S TOTAL WAR PLANS SO THAT ALL SALVADORANS UNITED AGAINST FASCISM WILL FIND A NATIONAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.

AFTER THE FIGHTING, OUR CAMERAMEN TOOK THESE CLIPS, WHICH SHOW THE HARSHNESS AND CRUELTY OF THIS WAR, WHICH HAS AFFECTED MANY CIVILIANS.

THE COMMAND POST IN SOYAPANGO WAS ALSO ATTACKED ON 30 JULY, AND ONE PERSON WAS KILLED. DURING TODAY'S ATTACK ON SAN RAMON, THE CIVIL DEFENSE UNITS WERE SUPPORTED BY THE RAMON BELLOSO BATTALION, WHICH WAS ABLE TO GAIN CONTROL OF THE SITUATION BY NIGHTFALL.
DEV-MUC3-0322	SAN SALVADOR, 2 AUG 89 -- THE SALVADORAN ARMY IS ON A STATE OF ALERT AND HAS INCREASED ITS SURVEILLANCE IN SAN SALVADOR TO COUNTER A NEW GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE, WHICH HAS CAUSED AT LEAST 48 MILITARY CASUALTIES OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS IN SEVERAL ACTIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

COL HERNANDEZ SAID: "THE GOVERNMENT WANTS WHAT IS BEST FOR THE PEOPLE, SO LAND TRANSPORTATION USERS WILL LOGICALLY BE AFFECTED BY THE INCREASE, BUT BUSINESSMEN ARE ALSO TRYING TO SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS." A CLANDESTINE REBEL STATION ASSERTED THAT THE ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT IN MORAZAN, USULUTAN, METAPAN, SAN MIGUEL, CABANAS, SAN VICENTE, LA PAZ, SAN SALVADOR, AND THE CONFLICT-RIDDEN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT. THE ARMED FORCES CLAIMED THEY HAD NO INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES OR THE CLASHES ANNOUNCED BY THE FMLN AND ASSERTED THAT, CONTRARY TO THE FMLN REPORT, THREE GUERRILLA FIGHTERS HAD DIED AND FIVE HAD BEEN KILLED IN VARIOUS CLASHES THAT OCCURRED IN NORTHERN AND EASTERN TOWNS, AND IN THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL. NEVERTHELESS, THE ARMY RECOGNIZED THAT TWO SOLDIERS AND TWO CIVILIANS HAD DIED, AND FOUR WERE WOUNDED IN ATTACKS ON ARMY POSITIONS AND IN AMBUSHES AGAINST ARMY AND GOVERNMENT VEHICLES. THE REBELS ALSO INCREASED THEIR SABOTAGE ACTIVITIES AGAINST THE ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEM AND BLEW UP A STILL UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF STRUCTURES AND TELEPHONE EXCHANGE BOXES IN SAN SALVADOR. THEY ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAVE PLACED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES ON SOME OF THE COUNTRY'S MAIN HIGHWAYS.
DEV-MUC3-0323	BOGOTA, 2 AUG 89 -- IN AN UNPRECEDENTED MOVE IN COLOMBIA'S RECENT HISTORY, THE PATRIOTIC UNION TOOK OVER THIS EVENING THE MAIN OFFICES OF THE INTERIOR MINISTRY IN BOGOTA AND TOLD THE GOVERNMENT THAT THEY WILL NOT LEAVE UNTIL A GOVERNMENT MEETING IS CONVENED TO ANALYZE THE UPSURGE IN VIOLENCE AGAINST UP MEMBERS. THE UP, THE COUNTRY'S THIRD-RANKING POLITICAL FORCE, LOST ABOUT 950 OF ITS MEMBERS AND LEADERS OVER THE PAST 4 YEARS. THIS MORNING, UP LEGAL ADVISOR ABELARDO DAZA WAS SHOT. THE TAKEOVER IS BY UP PRESIDENT BERNARDO JARAMILLO, VICE PRESIDENT DIEGO MONTANA, SECRETARY CARLOS ROMERO, AND TREASURER OSCAR DUENAS, WHO ASK THAT PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S GOVERNMENT DISCLOSE THE RESULTS OF THE FIGHT TO COMBAT THE RIGHT-WING SQUADS AND THE "TRUE BEHAVIOR" OF SOME MILITARY AND POLICE LEADERS IN SOME AREAS OF THE COUNTRY. JARAMILLO, WHO RECENTLY DENOUNCED BEFORE EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN ENTITIES COLOMBIA'S "DIRTY WAR," SAID THAT "THE UP AND PUBLIC OPINION NEED TO KNOW WHY GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND OTHER WELL KNOWN CRIMINALS HAVE NOT BEEN CAUGHT." JARAMILLO ADDED: "WE DO NOT WANT MORE BODYGUARDS, BUT THE POLITICAL RESOLVE TO DISMANTLE THE GANG OF HIRED GUNMEN AND ARREST THEIR LEADERS."
DEV-MUC3-0324	BOGOTA, 3 AUG 89 -- GUSTAVO GUERRA, COORDINATOR OF THE LEFTIST PATRIOTIC UNITY IN CORDOBA DEPARTMENT IN THE COUNTRY'S NORTHWEST, WAS GUNNED DOWN TODAY. MEANWHILE, THE FOUR TOPMOST UP LEADERS, HEADED BY PRESIDENT BERNARDO JARAMILLO, STILL OCCUPY THE OFFICE OF GOVERNMENT MINISTER ORLANDO VASQUEZ IN BOGOTA TO PROTEST THE MURDERS OF THE ORGANIZATION'S MEMBERS. THE UP LEADER IN CORDOBA WAS MURDERED AT APPROXIMATELY 1500 TODAY, AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE GOVERNMENT DESIGNATED IN BOGOTA GENERAL MIGUEL ALFREDO MAZA MARQUEZ, ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY DIRECTOR, AS THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATE TO MEET WITH THOSE WHO ARE OCCUPYING THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER'S OFFICE. GUERRA IS THE THIRD UP MEMBER MURDERED WITHIN THE PAST 36 HOURS. HIS DEATH RAISES TO 384 THE NUMBER OF THE ORGANIZATION'S MEMBERS AND LEADERS MURDERED SINCE IT WAS FOUNDED IN 1985. MAZA MARQUEZ IS EXPECTED TO MEET WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS WITH JARAMILLO AND THE THREE OTHER UP LEADERS WHO ARE IN THE MINISTER'S OFFICE.
DEV-MUC3-0325	SAN SALVADOR, 31 JUL 89 -- "I DO NOT WANT TO INTERFERE AT ALL. THE JUDGE WILL PRONOUNCE THE VERDICT; MEANWHILE, I WILL WAIT AND KEEP SILENT," MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, SAID YESTERDAY REGARDING HIS BROTHER SHORTLY AFTER ENDING SUNDAY'S HOMILY AT THE CATHEDRAL. THE PRELATE WAS REFERRING TO THE ARREST OF SALOMON ENRIQUE ROSA CHAVEZ, WHO WAS TURNED OVER TO THE FIRST CRIMINAL COURT BY THE NATIONAL POLICE AND ACCUSED OF BELONGING TO THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY ARMY . THE FIRST CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE ORDERED HIS TEMPORARY ARREST FOLLOWING A 72 - HOUR PERIOD, AS ESTABLISHED BY LAW FOR CRIMES OF BEARING COUNTERFEIT DOCUMENTS AND FOR BRIBERY; THESE CRIMES DO NOT REQUIRE A PRISON SENTENCE. THE AUXILIARY BISHOP SAID: "I HAVE REMAINED SILENT OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE LEGAL PROCESS, WHICH IS STILL UNDER WAY. MY BROTHER IS STILL IN PRISON, AND THAT IS WHY I PREFER TO WAIT FOR THE PROCESS TO END," HE SAID. THE PRISONER WAS NOT RELEASED ON SATURDAY, BUT HE WILL BE RELASED ON MONDAY, 7 AUGUST. ASKED BY REPORTERS IF THE CHARGES MADE AGAINST HIS BROTHER WOULD HURT HIS IMAGE OR THAT OF THE CHURCH, HE SAID THAT THE CHURCH'S DUTY TO THE COUNTRY IS DIFFICULT TO FULFILL BUT THAT THE CHURCH'S EFFORTS MUST CONTINUE, BECAUSE THE HUGE NUMBER OF PARISHIONERS WHO COME TO THE CATHEDRAL EVERY SUNDAY TO EASE THEIR PAINS CANNOT BE ABANDONED. "A SHEPHERD SHOULD NEVER LEAVE HIS FLOCK, AND, WHEN THERE ARE PROBLEMS, WE WILL CALMLY DEAL WITH THEM, BECAUSE THAT IS PART OF OUR MISSION," HE SAID. THE PRELATE EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN OVER THE SERIES OF CONTROVERSIES THAT AROSE DURING THE WEEK, SUCH AS THE CHARGES AND THE COUNTERCHARGES. HE SAID THAT THE MOST SERIOUS THING IS THE "CASE OF MSGR ROMERO," WHOSE MEMORY CONTINUES TO INSPIRE MANY AND IS A NIGHTMARE FOR THE MASTERMINDS AND PERPETRATORS OF HIS ABOMINABLE ASSASSINATION. THESE CHARGES WERE MADE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL BY FORMER PRESIDENT DUARTE, CURRENT ADMINISTRATION MEMBERS, AND WELL-KNOWN POLITICAL FIGURES. ROSA CHAVEZ REFERRED TO THE CHARGES FILED BY ATTORNEY GENERAL DR MAURICIO ERNESTO COLORADO, WHO LAST WEEK ASKED THE FIRST TREASURY COURT JUDGE TO DRAW UP AN INDICTMENT AGAINST JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY, AND A CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADER. THE AUXILIARY BISHOP SAID: "I GREATLY REGRET THE FACT THAT THIS ATMOSPHERE IS ONE OF -- I ACCUSE YOU, YOU ACCUSE ME, AND WE ACCUSE EACH OTHER. THAT IS NO WAY TO MAKE PROGRESS, BECAUSE PEOPLE EXPECT THEIR LEADERS TO BE MORE RESPONSIBLE AND SERIOUS. OTHERWISE, WHAT WILL THOSE OF US WHO ARE UNDERLINGS LEARN? THAT IS WHY I HAVE EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR ALL OF US TO HELP CLEAR THE AIR SO THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE THE PEACE FOR WHICH WE ALL YEARN." MSGR ROSA CHAVEZ CONGRATULATED ALL JOURNALISTS IN HIS HOMILY AND SAID: "I REMIND ALL JOURNALISTS -- AS POPE JOHN PAUL II ONCE SAID -- THAT NEWS, IF ONE THINKS ABOUT IT, IS NEVER IMPARTIAL, BECAUSE IT AT LEAST INTENTIONALLY AND IMPLICITLY RESPONDS TO IMPORTANT MATTERS. JOURNALISM PROVIDES AN INTIMATE LINK BETWEEN THE NEWS, EDUCATION, AND ESSENTIAL VALUES. ALMOST ALL MEN AND WOMEN WORKING FOR THE PRESS, RADIO, AND TELEVISION MEDIA MUST TRY TO ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK. HOWEVER, EACH DAY THEY NEED COURAGE AND MUST HAVE MUCH LOVE FOR THIS PEOPLE, WHO HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY, SO THAT THEY WILL REMAIN LOYAL TO THE VALUES OF THEIR PROFESSION. THAT IS WHY OUR CONGRATULATION MESSAGE BECOMES A PRAYER FOR THE LORD TO PROTECT THEM AND HELP THEM NOT TO GIVE IN DURING DIFFICULT TIMES."
DEV-MUC3-0326	GUATEMALA CITY, 4 AUG 89 -- POLICE REPORTED TODAY THAT RENE LOPEZ, AN IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL AND LEADER OF THE RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY , WAS SHOT TO DEATH AFTER HE WAS KIDNAPPED BY UNIDENTIFIED MEN. THE AUTHORITIES DISCLOSED TODAY THAT LOPEZ, WHO WORKED AT THE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT'S IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT, WAS KIDNAPPED ON 2 AUGUST AND HIS BODY WAS FOUND IN SOUTHERN GUATEMALA CITY TODAY. LOPEZ' DEATH IS ONE MORE PDC LEADER MURDERED. DANILO BARILLAS, ANOTHER PDC LEADER, WAS KILLED ON 1 AUGUST, APPARENTLY BY EXTREME RIGHTIST GROUPS. SO FAR, IT IS NOT KNOWN IF THE TWO KILLINGS ARE CONNECTED BECAUSE THE AUTHORITIES HAVE REMAINED SILENT ABOUT THIS CASE WHICH WAS NOT DISCLOSED UNTIL TODAY. UNOFFICIAL SOURCES NOTED THAT IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE TWO LEADERS KNEW TOO MANY DETAILS AND POSSIBLY NAMES OF PEOPLE INVOLVED IN COCAINE TRAFFICKING. HOWEVER, LOPEZ' RELATIVES REJECTED THAT HIS MURDER HAD ANY CONNECTION WITH THE DRUG TRAFFICKING DISCOVERED AT THE AIRPORT THIS WEEK. SECURITY FORCES FOUND 22 KG OF COCAINE IN A SUITCASE OWNED BY JOSE FERNANDO MINRO NAVAS, AN OFFICIAL OF THE PRESIDENCY'S ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT, ON 1 AUGUST. MINRO WAS CAPTURED AND TURNED OVER TO A COURT. POLICE SOURCES STATED THAT THEY HAVE CONTINUED THE INVESTIGATIONS TO GET MORE DETAILS OF THE TWO KILLINGS BUT THEY NEITHER DENIED NOR CONFIRMED ANY CONNECTION OF SUSPECTED DRUG TRAFFICKERS WITH THE MURDER OF THE PDC LEADERS.
DEV-MUC3-0327	LIMA, 4 AUG 89 -- A SEVERE BLOW HAS BEEN DEALT TO THE SHINING PATH TERRORIST ORGANIZATION IN LIMA. IN THEIR TIRELESS STRUGGLE AGAINST SUBVERSION, THE POLICE TODAY PRESENTED TO THE PRESS 29 SHINING PATH MEMBERS WHO WERE ARRESTED IN DIFFERENT OPERATIONS. THE TERRORISTS WERE PRESENTED AT THE DIRCOTE FACILITIES. INTERIOR MINISTER AGUSTIN MANTILLA HAS SAID THAT WITH THESE ARRESTS THE POLICE HAVE DISMANTLED A MAJOR SHINING PATH NETWORK.
DEV-MUC3-0328	TEGUCIGALPA, 3 AUG 89 -- RAMON CUSTODIO LOPEZ, PRESIDENT OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENSE COMMITTEE HAS PREDICTED THAT THE TELA SUMMIT WILL BE CHAOTIC BECAUSE, IN HIS OPINION, THE HONDURAN AND SALVADORAN GOVERNMENTS WILL INTERFERE. THE CODEH PRESIDENT ALSO REVEALED THAT THE BATTALION 3-16'S NEW NAME IS THE COUNTERINSURGENCY BATTALION AND ITS COMMANDER IS COLONEL ALBERTO ANDINO BENITEZ. CUSTODIO SAID THIS DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE HE HELD 2 AUGUST. WE HAVE CALLED THIS NEWS CONFERENCE BECAUSE WE WANT TO WARN THE PEOPLE, THE FOREIGN JOURNALISTS WHO ARE HERE, AND THE OTHER CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ABOUT THE ATMOSPHERE OF INSECURITY WHICH AFFLICTS THE HONDURAN PEOPLE. FIRST OF ALL, WE WILL MENTION THE ASSASSINATIONS WHICH OCCURRED IN JULY AT SAN PEDRO SULA: EDUARDO HERRERA, SALOMON VALLECILLO, AND DR RAMON ROBERTO GARAY. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ASSASSINATIONS WERE PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS SO WE WOULD LIKE A JUDGE TO CALL THE NEW COMMANDER OF BATTALION 3-16 -- NOW CALLED COUNTERINSURGENCY BATTALION -- COLONEL ALBERTO ANDINO BENITEZ TO TESTIFY. THERE ARE REPORTS THAT A MEMBER OF THE 3-16TH BATTALION CONTACTED SALOMON VALLECILLO PRIOR TO HIS DEATH. LIKEWISE, I WANT TO MENTION HOW THE CITIZENRY IS EXPOSED TO POLICE BRUTALITY. THERE IS THE CASE OF JUSTO PASTOR ESCOBAR SILVA, WHO WAS ASSASSINATED BY A FUSEP AGENT WHO IS NOW SERVING A PRISON SENTENCE. FURTHERMORE, PEOPLE FEEL INSECURE IN THE COUNTRY, AND I WILL MENTION A CASE WHICH OCCURRED 3 WEEKS AGO. DR MARCO ANTONIO BOGRAN WAS TAKEN WITH ALL HIS HOUSEHOLD EMPLOYEES TO THE DNI AND HELD FROM 0800 TO 1500. HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO CALL HIS LAWYER OR HIS RELATIVES, AND HE WAS HELD IN ISOLATION. HE WAS NATURALLY AFRAID THE WORST WOULD HAPPEN. NO ONE EXPLAINED ANYTHING UNTIL THE END. HE WAS TOLD THAT SOMEONE HAD REPORTEDLY MADE A SUBVERSIVE PHONE CALL FROM HIS HOUSE. THIS MEANS THAT HIS TELEPHONE IS BEING ILLEGALLY TAPPED BECAUSE NO ONE HERE HAS THE RIGHT TO CONTROL ANYONE'S CALLS. THE MILITARY MEN IN CHARGE OF HONDUTEL ILLEGALLY ABUSE THEIR POWER WHEN THEY HEAR AND CONTROL TELEPHONE CALLS BECAUSE THIS SHOULD BE HANDLED BY THE CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES. COLONEL MANUEL ENRIQUE SUAREZ BENAVIDES, CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICE, HAS REACTED TO CUSTODIO LOPEZ' STATEMENT. I HAVE HEARD PART OF RAMON CUSTODIO'S NEWS CONFERENCE ON CODEH FOREIGN POLICY, AND WE OBSERVED HIS ANIMOSITY TOWARD THE CONTRAS AND HIS AFFECTION FOR THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT IN EL SALVADOR. WE THOUGHT HE ONLY HANDLED HUMAN RIGHTS BUT WE SEE HE ALSO DELVES IN FOREIGN POLICY. HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT THE MAIN ISSUE. I WANT TO REFER TO THE FACT THAT YEARS AGO WE PUBLICLY PROVED THAT BATTALION 3-16, WHICH HE MENTIONED SO MANY TIMES, HAD BEEN DISMANTLED SO THE UNIT NO LONGER EXISTS. NEVERTHELESS, HE SEEMS TO HAVE FORGOTTEN THIS, OR HE MAY BE INTENTIONALLY FORGETTING THIS. THE UNIT DISAPPEARED BUT THE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE BATTALION HE MENTIONS DOES EXIST AND ITS COMMANDER, WHICH HE MENTIONS, IS A MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES. IN OTHER WORDS, HE HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ACTIVITIES THAT BATTALION 3-16 REPORTEDLY CARRIED OUT. IF CUSTODIO WANTS IT, WE CAN SEND HIM A COPY OF THE AGREEMENTS TO DISMANTLE BATTALION 3-16 AND TO APPOINT THE CURRENT COMMANDER OF THE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE BATTALION, WHICH HAS EXISTED FOR MANY YEARS. THAT IS ALL. I WANTED TO CLARIFY THIS AND I HOPE DR CUSTODIO IS MORE OBJECTIVE IN HIS STATEMENTS. I SOMETIMES BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEM OF BEING ON ONE SIDE THE MIND. COLONEL, WHEN WILL THE ARMED FORCES BE ABLE TO GIVE THE HONDURAN PEOPLE EXACT INFORMATION ON THE LATEST PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN REPORTED MISSING IN OUR COUNTRY? EXCUSE ME, I CAN HARDLY HEAR YOU. I ASKED: WHEN CAN THE HONDURAN PEOPLE HAVE EXACT INFORMATION ON THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN REPORTED MISSING IN THE COUNTRY? LOOK, WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL SHORTLY, AND I AM TALKING ABOUT A SHORT TIME, HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION FOR THE HONDURAN PEOPLE ON THE PERSONS YOU HAVE MENTIONED BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATIONS CONTINUE. THE POLICE ARREST PEOPLE BASED ON THE SUSPICION OR HARD, RATIONAL EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL ACTIONS. I BELIEVE YOU WILL SOON HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION ON THE PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN ARRESTED BY THE POLICE.
DEV-MUC3-0329	PYONGYANG , 4 AUG 89 -- A LETTER TO THE GREAT LEADER PRESIDENT KIM IL-SONG WAS ADOPTED AT A MEETING FOR SOLIDARITY WITH THE KOREAN PEOPLE HELD IN LIMA, PERU, ON JULY 19. IN THE NAME OF THE PERUVIAN PEOPLE, IT CONDEMNED THE U.S. IMPERIALISTS WHO UNLEASHED ON JUNE 25, 1950, A WAR OF AGGRESSION AGAINST THE NEWLY-FOUNDED DPRK WHICH WAS PURSUING A PEACE POLICY. THE U.S. IMPERIALISTS ADOPTED IN THE WAR THE SCORCHED EARTH TACTICS BY INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING, BUT THEY COULD NOT BRING TO THEIR KNEES THE KOREAN PEOPLE GUIDED BY THE RESPECTED MARSHAL KIM IL-SONG, THE FOUNDER OF THE GREAT CHUCHE IDEA AND IRON-WILLED BRILLIANT COMMANDER, THE LETTER NOTED, ADDING: THE U.S. IMPERIALISTS SUFFERED THE MOST SERIOUS DEFEAT AND IGNONIMITY IN THEIR HISTORY OF AGGRESSION, WHILE MARSHAL KIM IL-SONG, THE IRON-WILLED BRILLIANT COMMANDER, DEFEATED THEM AND OPENED A ROAD OF LIBERATION TO THE PEOPLE. IT SUPPORTED THE PROPOSALS FOR THE INDEPENDENT AND PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION OF KOREA ADVANCED BY PRESIDENT KIM IL-SONG AND DEMANDED THAT THE U.S. IMPERIALIST WITHDRAW ARMED FORCES AND NUCLEAR BASES FROM SOUTH KOREA. THE LETTER WISHED PRESIDENT KIM IL-SONG GOOD HEALTH AND LONG LIFE.
DEV-MUC3-0330	TEGUCIGALPA, 7 AUG 89 -- I BELIEVE THAT PRESIDENT BUSH WILL HAVE TO ACCEPT REALITY, WHICH IS THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEOPLES ARE TIRED OF WAR; THEY WANT PEACE. WE CENTRAL AMERICANS ARE THE ONES WHO ARE BEING KILLED, NOT THE U.S. SOLDIERS. THE UNITED STATES HAS THE DUTY TO RESPECT DECISIONS MADE BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEOPLES AND GOVERNMENTS. WHAT ARE THE REAL BASES OF THE AGREEMENT REACHED WITH THE NICARAGUAN OPPOSITION? IT IS A DOCUMENT THAT WAS SIGNED BY ALL POLITICAL PARTIES. OBVIOUSLY, I SIGNED IT MYSELF. THE MAIN POINT IN THE DOCUMENT IS THAT WE PROPOSE THE DISMANTLING OF THE CONTRAS. THAT WAS THE FIRST ISSUE WE DISCUSSED. THE DOCUMENT NOTES THAT ONCE THE CONTRAS ARE DISMANTLED, THERE WILL BE AN AMNESTY, AND PRISONERS REMAINING IN NICARAGUA WILL BE RELEASED. WE ALSO STRESSED THAT FOREIGN FORCES SHOULD NOT MEDDLE IN THE NICARAGUAN ELECTION PROCESS; THE CIA, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED TO MEDDLE IN THE NICARAGUAN ELECTION PROCESS; THIS WAS DISCUSSED AT THE U.S. CONGRESS. THEREFORE, WE ARE AGAINST THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY, WHICH SHOWS DISRESPECT FOR NICARAGUAN SOVEREIGNTY. CONCERNING . HOWEVER, IS IT NOT ALSO NECESSARY TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE CONTRAS? WHAT DID YOU SAY? THAT WE MUST TALK TO THE CONTRAS? IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO TALK TO THE CONTRAS? WELL, WE WILL HAVE TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE CONTRAS TO FIND OUT HOW THEY CAN BE DISLODGED AND RETURN TO NICARAGUA; OR WE MUST DISCUSS WHETHER THEY WANT TO STAY HERE IN HONDURAS -- BECAUSE SOME MAY WANT TO STAY IN HONDURAS AND OTHERS MAY WANT TO GO ELSEWHERE, SUCH AS TO THE UNITED STATES. I BELIEVE THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT TO STAY IN CENTRAL AMERICA, BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES PROMOTED THE CONTRAS. THE UNITED STATES SHOULD NOT PLACE THIS BURDEN ON HONDURAS OR ON THE OTHER CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES. THEREFORE, WE WILL HAVE TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE CONTRAS TO GET THEM OUT OF HERE, TO GET THEM OUT OF HERE IN AN ORDERLY MANNER AND NOT BY SHOOTING AT THEM. MR PRESIDENT, THE CONTRAS ARE DEMANDING GUARANTEES. GUARANTEES ALREADY EXIST IN NICARAGUA. COMMANDER ORTEGA, DO YOU HELP THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT ? WHAT? DO YOU PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THE FMLN? WE ARE IN FAVOR OF A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION. SAID IT HAS EVIDENCE THAT NICARAGUA PROVIDES ASSISTANCE TO THE FMLN. THIS WAS SAID YESTERDAY BY NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER MIGUEL D'ESCOTO. THE STATEMENTS BY COMMANDER DANIEL ORTEGA HAVE BEEN INTERRUPTED BECAUSE THE PLANE THAT BROUGHT HIM TO THE AIRPORT IS ABOUT TO TAKE OFF FROM THE TELA AIRPORT. AT THIS TIME, THE HONDURAN FOREIGN MINISTER IS ASKING MR ORTEGA TO GO TO . THE FOREIGN MINISTER IS TRYING TO CONVINCE ORTEGA TO STOP MAKING STATEMENTS, BUT MR ORTEGA SEEMS VERY WILLING TO CONTINUE TO MAKE STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS. AT THIS MOMENT, PRESIDENT ORTEGA CANNOT ANSWER THE QUESTIONS BEING POSED BY LOCAL AND FOREIGN NEWSMEN BECAUSE THE PLANE IS TAKING OFF. MR ORTEGA... INTERRUPTING CONCERNING YOUR QUESTION A FEW MINUTES AGO REGARDING THE FMLN. I JUST HELD A MEETING; I JUST HELD A MEETING WITH THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND. THEY ARE TOURING THE AREA, AND I HAVE MET THEM. THEY GAVE ME A LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS EXPRESSING THEIR WILLINGNESS TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE WITH THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT, USING AS A BASIS THE DIALOGUE THAT THE FMLN HAS HELD WITH THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES IN EL SALVADOR. THE FLMN RECENTLY MET WITH THE LEGALLY REGISTERED POLITICAL PARTIES IN EL SALVADOR. THE FMLN HAS MET WITH SOCIAL GROUPS, AND, AFTER THESE TALKS, THEY MADE A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL: TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE TO REACH A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE ENDURING. OUR DESIRE IS TO SUPPORT A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION -- AS ESTABLISHED IN THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENTS - - TO FIND A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THIS KIND OF CENTRAL AMERICAN CONFLICT.
DEV-MUC3-0331	TEGUCIGALPA, 4 AUG 89 -- THE HONDURAN ARMY REPORTED TODAY THAT IT DISMANTLED A SALVADORAN GUERRILLA CELL THAT WAS IN CHARGE OF PROVIDING LOGISTICAL SUPPORT AND TRANSPORTATION OF WEAPONS FROM NICARAGUA TO EL SALVADOR THROUGH HONDURAN TERRITORY. DURING MILITARY ACTIONS THAT BEGAN ON 29 JULY, ONE OF THE GUERRILLAS WAS KILLED AND SIX WERE ARRESTED. THREE OF THOSE WHO WERE ARRESTED WERE SALVADORAN CITIZENS AND THE OTHER THREE WERE HONDURANS, ACCORDING TO DOCUMENTS THEY WERE CARRYING. THE DETAINEES WERE MEMBERS OF A CELL THAT TRANSPORTED WEAPONS TO THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT IN NORTHERN EL SALVADOR FROM NORTHERN NICARAGUA THROUGH EASTERN, CENTRAL, AND WESTERN HONDURAS. THE GUERRILLAS, WHO ALSO TRANSPORTED MEDICAL EQUIPMENT, LITERATURE, AND FOOD, RAN SMALL BUSINESSES IN HONDURAS THAT SERVED AS "FRONTS," A MILITARY SOURCE SAID. ACCORDING TO HONDURAN ARMY SPOKESMAN COLONEL MANUEL ENRIQUE SUAREZ, THE DETAINEES ARE IN COURT CUSTODY, AND 71 AK-47 RIFLES, RAMRODS, BAYONETS, AND OTHER EQUIPMENT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED AS PROOF AGAINST THEM. COL SUAREZ CONFIRMED THE EXISTENCE OF "SEVERAL OTHER GROUPS THAT WE ARE INVESTIGATING WITH A VIEW TO DISMANTLING THEM." THE OFFICER SAID THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN PROVEN IF THE WEAPONS ARE SUPPLIED TO THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS BY THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT "BECAUSE SO FAR WE ONLY KNOW THAT THE WEAPONS ARE TRANSPORTED FROM NICARAGUA TO EL SALVADOR THROUGH HONDURAS."
DEV-MUC3-0332	PANAMA CITY , 6 AUG 89 -- PRESIDENT MANUEL SOLIS PALMA HAS SAID IN LA PAZ, BOLIVIA THAT PANAMA IS LIKE A COUNTRY BEING INVADED WITHOUT A SHOT BEING FIRED. THAT IS HOW THE PANAMANIAN PRESIDENT DESCRIBED THE PERMANENT U.S. INVASION ON PANAMANIAN TERRITORY. HE SAID THAT U.S. SOLDIERS PERMANENTLY VIOLATE THE PANAMA CANAL TREATIES AND FREQUENTLY OCCUPY UNAUTHORIZED ZONES WITH TANKS AND SOLDIERS. SOLIS PALMA ALSO SAID PANAMA HAS AVOIDED PROVOCATIONS SO THAT THE INVADERS CANNOT JUSTIFY THEIR ACTIONS, BUT IN CASE OF A CONFRONTATION, THE PEOPLE AND THE PANAMA DEFENSE FORCES ARE PREPARED TO DEFEND THE NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY. AS FOR PANAMA'S INTERNAL SITUATION, SOLIS PALMA SAID HIS GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO ACHIEVE AN UNDERSTANDING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND OTHER SOCIAL AND POLITICAL GROUPS SO THAT A NATIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT CAN BE CREATED BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE CANAL BELONGS TO PANAMA AND NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY CANNOT BE VIOLATED.
DEV-MUC3-0333	TEGUCIGALPA, 7 AUG 89 -- WHAT IS THE PREVAILING ATMOSPHERE NOW? I THINK THAT ALL OF THE PRESIDENTS ARE HOPING THAT AN AGREEMENT WILL BE REACHED. WE HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY WORKING ON THAT AGREEMENT SO THAT A FINAL AGREEMENT CAN BE ISSUED. WE HAVE PREPARED DOCUMENTS ON WHICH, I WOULD SAY, THERE IS A CERTAIN CONSENSUS--SUCH AS ON THE DOCUMENT ON THE OF THE CONTRAS, THE DOCUMENT ON THE HONDURAN-NICARAGUAN AGREEMENT CONCERNING THE SUIT NICARAGUA HAS FILED BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE, THE SALVADORAN ISSUE, AND OTHER POINTS. I THINK THERE IS A POLITICAL RESOLVE ON THE PART OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMETHING POSITIVE EMERGES FROM THIS SUMMIT. I AM SURE THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS HOPING THAT NOTHING WILL RESULT FROM THIS SUMMIT. I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY EXERTING STRONG PRESSURES SO THAT NOTHING WILL COME FROM THIS SUMMIT. MR PRESIDENT: WHAT ARE THE PROCEDURES FOR NICARAGUA'S WITHDRAWAL OF ITS SUIT AGAINST HONDURAS? THIS HAS TO BE LINKED TO COMPLETE COMPLIANCE WITH THE PLAN FOR THE CONTRA WITHDRAWAL. IN OTHER WORDS, THE CONTRAS MUST FIRST LEAVE? OF COURSE. THAT IS OUR INSURANCE. MR PRESIDENT, HAS HONDURAS AGREED TO THIS? WE ARE EXCHANGING VIEWPOINTS ON THIS. THE SUIT REPRESENTS AN INSURANCE FOR YOU, COMMANDER? WHICH GROUPS HAS THE UNITED STATES BEEN PRESSURING? THE CENTRAL AMERICAN GROUPS. THERE HAVE BEEN DIRECT AND INDIRECT CONTACTS. THE UNITED STATES HAS CONTACTED THE CENTRAL AMERICAN DELEGATIONS IN HOPES THAT NO AGREEMENT WILL BE REACHED. THE AMERICANS CONTINUE TO FAVOR THE PRESENCE OF THE CONTRAS. THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT BUSH MET WITH CONTRA LEADERS ON THE EVE OF THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS SUMMIT IS A SLAP IN THE FACE TO THIS MEETING. WHEN YOU MENTION THESE PRESSURES, MR PRESIDENT, TO WHICH COUNTRIES ARE YOU REFERRING? ALL OF THEM, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NICARAGUA. I HAVE NO DOUBTS THAT RIGHT NOW THE UNITED STATES IS EXERTING PRESSURE, BECAUSE IT WANTS TO KILL THIS SUMMIT JUST WHEN WE ARE ABOUT TO REACH AN AGREEMENT. IF NO AGREEMENT IS REACHED AT THIS SUMMIT, THE UNITED STATES WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. BECAUSE WE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES HAVE SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY AND SUFFICIENT SELF-DETERMINATION AND INDEPENDENCE TO DECIDE OUR OWN ACTIONS. AT THIS STAGE, HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE PRESIDENTS SUMMIT? IS THIS SUMMIT A FAILURE OR A SUCCESS? I THINK IT HAS TO BE A SUCCESS, EVEN IF THE UNITED STATES HAS NOT GIVEN UP TRYING TO MAKE IT FAIL. THIS IS THE TIME, AND I AM SURE THAT IT IS TRYING .
DEV-MUC3-0334	SAN SALVADOR, 8 AUG 89 -- A U.S. CITIZEN DIED AT THE DIAGNOSIS HOSPITAL EARLY THIS MORNING. ACCORDING TO REPORTS WE RECEIVED, THE U.S. CITIZEN WAS SHOT LAST NIGHT WHEN UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS TRIED TO ENTER HIS RESIDENCE AT SAN SALVADOR'S VENEZUELA NEIGHBORHOOD, NEAR LAS COROLAS AVENUE. HE RECEIVED TWO BULLET WOUNDS AND WAS TAKEN TO THE DIAGNOSIS HOSPITAL, WHERE HE DIED EARLY THIS MORNING. THE U.S. CITIZEN WAS IDENTIFIED AS BILLY MURPHY. HIS OCCUPATION IS STILL UNKNOWN.
DEV-MUC3-0335	LIMA, 7 AUG 89 -- INTERIOR MINISTRY SOURCES TODAY REPORTED IN LIMA THAT THREE ALLEGED MEMBERS OF THE TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT HAVE DIED IN A CLASH WITH THE NATIONAL POLICE . THE GUERRILLAS WERE TRAVELING IN A STOLEN VEHICLE ON 6 AUGUST, WHEN THEY WERE DETECTED BY A PN PATROL IN CHICLAYO PROVINCE. THE PATROL ORDERED THEM TO STOP, BUT THE GUERRILLAS FLED. THE POLICE PATROL GAVE CHASE AND CAUGHT THE GUERRILLAS 15 KM FROM CHICLAYO, ON THE ROAD TO CHONGOYAPE. A CLASH ENSUED, AND JUAN ZURITA, CESAR ORBEGOZO, AND ERNESTO BENAVIDES WERE KILLED. THE INTERIOR MINISTRY BULLETIN REPORTS THAT THE POLICEMEN SEIZED TWO SUB-MACHINE GUNS, A REVOLVER, AND AN MRTA FLAG FROM THE GUERRILLAS. THE PRO-GUEVARA MRTA STARTED ITS ARMED FIGHT IN 1984, WHEN IT RIDDLED THE U.S. EMBASSY WITH BULLETS. THE MRTA HAS ALSO ATTACKED THE CHINESE, SOVIET, SPANISH, AND ARGENTINE EMBASSIES. IN JANUARY, THE POLICE ARRESTED MRTA'S MAIN LEADER, VICTOR POLAY CAMPOS. AT LEAST 100 MRTA MEMBERS HAVE BEEN KILLED BY THE POLICE THIS YEAR. POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN PERU, WHICH WAS UNLEASHED BY THE MAOIST SHINING PATH IN 1980, HAS KILLED MORE THAN 15,000 PEOPLE AND CAUSED LOSSES TOTALLING SOME $12 BILLION -- SOME 60 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL PERUVIAN FOREIGN DEBT.
DEV-MUC3-0336	SAN SALVADOR, 9 AUG 89 -- I DO NOT SEEK, NOR WILL I SEEK, THE LAURELS OF VICTORY. I DO NOT SEEK HUMILIATING DEFEATS FOR ANYONE. WHAT I SEEK IS PEACE. I SEEK REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY IN OUR HOMELAND. I SEEK TO SOLVE THE SOCIAL PROBLEMS OF OUR PEOPLE BY DEVELOPING AN ECONOMY THAT WILL BENEFIT ALL SALVADORANS. TO THE LEADERS OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES, A VITAL COMPONENT OF REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY AND OUR NATION'S IDEOLOGICAL PLURALISM, WE WISH TO INVITE YOU TO JOIN US SO THAT TOGETHER WE CAN WORK FOR PEACE IN EL SALVADOR. LET US SET THE PARTY BANNERS ASIDE AND PICK UP OUR NATIONAL FLAG. TO THE FMLN LEADERS, I REITERATE MY DETERMINATION AND POLITICAL RESOLVE TO WORK FOR PEACE. I AM TRULY INTERESTED IN PUTTING AN END TO THE BLOODY FRATRICIDAL STRUGGLE. I HOPE THE FMLN WILL HEAR THE CALL MADE BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND CONTRIBUTE TO STRENGTHEN THE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION AND DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESSES AS ESTABLISHED IN THE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENTS. I ALSO HOPE THAT THE FMLN WILL SET ASIDE ITS INTRANSIGENT ATTITUDE AND VOLUNTARILY AGREE TO CEASE ALL HOSTILITIES AND THAT IT WILL DEMONSTRATE ITS PEACEFUL INTENTIONS BY STOPPING ALL TERRORIST ACTIONS AGAINST THE PEOPLE. I HOPE THE FMLN WILL MEET WITH US TO BEGIN THIS PROCESS OF PERMANENT AND FIRM DIALOGUE, WHICH WE ARE WILLING TO BEGIN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AGREEMENTS ADOPTED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF ESQUIPULAS II AT THE RECENT PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT. THIS DIALOGUE SHOULD BE HELD WITHOUT CONDITIONS AND WITHOUT ANY PROPAGANDA. TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WHO FOR YEARS HAVE BEEN SUFFERING THE HARD AND SAD CONSEQUENCES OF A WAR AND WHO ARE ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PEACE, I ASSURE YOU THAT MY GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO WORK FOR PEACE BY SETTING ASIDE ALL POLITICAL, PERSONAL, OR PARTISAN INTERESTS. I WANT ALL SALVADORANS TO CONTRIBUTE TO ACHIEVING A CIVILIZED END TO THE CONFLICT, AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ALL ATTITUDES THAT HINDER THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PEACE SET ASIDE. PEACE MUST NOT BE AN INSTRUMENT FOR AN IDEOLOGICAL OR PARTISAN STRUGGLE. LET US SWITCH THE ROLES. LET US BE THE INSTRUMENTS FOR ACHIEVING PEACE. THE SELFISH ATTITUDE THAT HAS HURT THE HOMELAND DEEPLY MUST BE SET ASIDE, AND WE MUST PLACE THE SACRED INTERESTS OF OUR BELOVED EL SALVADOR ABOVE ALL ELSE. PEACE CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED WITH THE HELP OF EVERYONE. WE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT ACHIEVING PEACE WILL BE THE BIGGEST VICTORY OF THE PEOPLE, AND THIS DOES NOT MEAN IDEOLOGICAL SURRENDER. WE ALL HAVE OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF OUR CONSTITUTION. THE CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES US IDEOLOGICAL PLURALISM AND REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY. SALVADORAN BROTHERS, LET US PRAY THAT GOD WILL OVERSEE THIS EFFORT FOR PEACE. MAY THE SAVIOR OF THE WORLD GUIDE AND ENLIGHTEN US. THANK YOU AND MAY GOD BLESS YOU.
DEV-MUC3-0337	LIMA, 9 AUG 89 -- TODAY, THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT DECLARED A 30-DAY STATE OF EMERGENCY IN HUAROCHIRI PROVINCE, LIMA DEPARTMENT, DUE TO THE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES IN THIS PROVINCE. ACCORDING TO THE PERTINENT DECREE PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL GAZETTE, "INDIVIDUALS TRYING TO DISRUPT PUBLIC ORDER ARE CARRYING OUT ACTS OF VIOLENCE IN MINING CENTERS, CAUSING SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC LOSSES, BOTH TO PRIVATE ENTERPRISES AND TO THE STATE." ON 1 JULY 1989, THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT DECLARED A 60-DAY STATE OF EMERGENCY IN ANDAHUAYLAS PROVINCE, APURIMAC DEPARTMENT, IN SOUTHERN PERU, AND ALSO EXTENDED FOR 60 DAYS THE STATE OF EMERGENCY IN SEVEN PERUVIAN DEPARTMENTS. THE STATE OF EMERGENCY, INVOLVING AT LEAST HALF OF THE 22-MILLION PERUVIAN POPULATION AND ONE-THIRD OF THE NATIONAL TERRITORY, INVOLVES THE SUSPENSION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND THE MILITARY CONTROL OF THE TERRITORY AFFECTED BY THIS MEASURE.
DEV-MUC3-0338	SAN SALVADOR, 9 AUG 89 -- NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEPUTY MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON SAID TODAY THAT THE POSITION ADOPTED BY EL SALVADOR THROUGH PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AT THE SUMMIT IN TELA, HONDURAS, IS POSITIVE BECAUSE EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA. HOWEVER, HE SAID THAT THE POSITION OF THE FMLN WILL ACTUALLY BE VERY CRITICAL NOW. THE FMLN WILL NOT LOOK GOOD INTERNATIONALLY IF IT REJECTS THE DIALOGUE. HERE IS AN EXCERPT OF D'AUBUISSON'S STATEMENTS, IN WHICH HE ALSO REVEALED THAT COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS HAS OFFERED TO MEDIATE THE DIALOGUE. ... FALLACIES. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE CLAIMED TO WANT SOMETHING AND ENDED UP DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT. THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO IMPROVE THEIR INTERNATIONAL IMAGE AND DO NOT WANT TO LOOK LIKE BEFORE THE LITTLE MANGY-DOGS WHO GO ABOUT PLANTING BOMBS HERE. THEY WANT TO DEMONSTRATE PERHAPS THAT THEY ALWAYS HOLD A HEGEMONIC POSITION HERE AND WILL TRY TO OBTAIN A BETTER NEGOTIATING POSITION FOR THEIR ILLEGAL FORCES, WHICH ARE STILL GOING AROUND AND KILLING PEOPLE . NEVERTHELESS, MAJOR, DO YOU VIEW THIS MEETING AS POSITIVE WITH THE FMLN -- THAT IS, THE DIALOGUE -- NOW THAT SOMETHING TANGIBLE HAS COME OUT OF THE SUMMIT? DO YOU THINK PEACE CAN BE ACHIEVED? THE OBJECTIVE OF ALL SALVADORANS -- AND IN THIS REGARD WE SPEAK FROM THE HEART -- IS TO ACHIEVE PEACE. IF THE FMLN COOPERATES, WE WELCOME ITS COOPERATION. HOWEVER, IF IT DOES NOT COOPERATE, THERE WILL BE FMLN MEMBERS WHO WILL DEMOBILIZE, THE SAME WAY SO MANY PEOPLE FROM THE ARE DESERTING. THESE PEOPLE HAD TO BE GIVEN GUARANTEES. WE WILL SEE LATER IF, AS THEY SAY, THEY ARE TRULY WORKING, OR STRUGGLING, FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE MORE POSITIVE ACTIONS. HOWEVER, WE SEE EVERYTHING AS BEING WELL ON THE WAY TO ACHIEVING PEACE IN A SHORT TIME. D'AUBUISSON SAID THAT IF THE FMLN DOES NOT AGREE TO THE DEMOBILIZATION, THE FMLN MEMBERS WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE IF PEACE IS NOT ACHIEVED. REGARDING THE COMMISSION, HE SAID IT IS ALREADY BEING ORGANIZED AND WILL BEGIN A DIALOGUE SOON. ...A CONTINUOUS DIALOGUE TO FIND SOLUTIONS. THAT IS WHY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HAS INSTRUCTED THAT IT HAVE NO PRIOR AGENDA BUT THAT IT JUST BEGIN. THEIR FIRST STEP SHOULD BE TO SIT DOWN AT A TABLE TO TALK, TO NEGOTIATE, TO ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE. AND THIS IS TO GO ON CONTINUOUSLY UNTIL SOLUTIONS ARE FOUND AND THEY ACHIEVE SOMETHING TANGIBLE, WHICH IS THE FINAL SOLUTION. WELL, FOR EXAMPLE, COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT ARIAS HAS OFFERED TO ACT AS MEDIATOR OR INTERMEDIARY. HE SAID THAT IF THE COMMISSION GOES TO SAN JOSE, HE WILL TAKE IT UPON HIMSELF TO INVITE THESE GENTLEMEN TOO AND TO GIVE THEM WHATEVER THEY NEED FOR THIS MEETING TO BEGIN. AFTER THAT, THEY THEMSELVES WILL DEVELOP THE MECHANISMS. MAJ D'AUBUISSON SAID THE COMMISSION WILL BE SWORN IN AND WILL MAINTAIN AN ONGOING DIALOGUE WITH THE FMLN REPRESENTATIVES. COMMENTING ON LEGISLATIVE WORK, HE SAID THAT TODAY THE POLITICAL COMMITTEE WILL MEET TO ELECT THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMMISSION ON CORRUPTION, WHICH HAD BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY NEGLECTED BY DR JAIME VENTURA. THE ONLY CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE COMMISSION ON CORRUPTION IS DEPUTY ROBERTO ANGULO, VICE PRESIDENT AND ACTING PRESIDENT OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY.
DEV-MUC3-0339	BOGOTA, 7 AUG 89 -- SIMON BOLIVAR AND FRANCISCO DE PAULA SANTANDER GAVE OUR ARMED FORCES THE MISSION OF DEFENDING FREEDOM, INDEPENDENCE, AND DEMOCRACY. THROUGHOUT HISTORY, THE NATIONAL ARMY HAS COMPLIED WITH THAT MANDATE. IT HAS NOT BEEN AN EASY TASK, EVEN LESS SO DURING THE TIMES WE ARE LIVING. VERY FEW NATIONS HAVE HAD TO CONFRONT SIMULTANEOUSLY SO MANY DIFFICULT CHALLENGES. CONFRONTED BY A COMBINATION OF SOURCES OF DISRUPTION, THE ARMED FORCES HAVE NOT LOST THEIR DETERMIANTION AND OPTIMISM, NOR HAVE THEY STOPPED FOR 1 MINUTE TO STRUGGLE FOR THE REESTABLISHMENT OF TRANQUILLITY FOR THE CITIZENS, AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF LIFE, HONOR, AND PROPERTY OF COLOMBIANS. AS THE VIOLENCE INCREASES, OUR COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY AND COLOMBIA IS STRENGTHENED. THE PRICE OF COURAGE AND FIRMNESS HAS BEEN HIGH. MANY SOLDIERS, OFFICERS, AND NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS HAVE BEEN KILLED, BUT THEY ARE THE HEROES OF DEMOCRACY. ON THE OCCASION OF ARMY DAY, I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE VAST NATIONAL MAJORITY AND CONVEY TO THEIR FAMILIES, FRIENDS, AND FELLOW SOLDIERS OUR MESSAGE OF ENCOURAGEMENT, APPRECIATION, AND HOPE. THEIR EFFORTS HAVE NOT BEEN IN VAIN. THE BATTLE TO PRESERVE DEMOCRACY AND DEFEAT VIOLENCE CONTINUES. THE DETERMINATION OF COLOMBIANS DOES NOT WEAKEN. OUR ENEMIES ARE ALONE, AS NEVER BEFORE, AND THIS WE OWE TO PERMANENT ACTIONS BY OUR ARMED FORCES. IN THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN, I OFFERED THE COLOMBIANS A POLICY OF RECONCILIATION BASED ON DEFINED GUIDELINES AND CLEAR PRINCIPLES. THIS WAS THE DEMOCRATIC MANDATE THAT WE RECEIVED FROM THE PEOPLE. NOW, WHEN WE ARE HARVESTING THE RESULTS OF THAT STRATEGY, WE WILL NOT GIVE UP. THE PEACE INITIATIVE HAS SHOWED THAT IT CAN OPERATE AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH WE WILL CONDUCT POLITICAL ACTION FOR NATIONAL RECONCILIATION. SOME BELIEVE THAT TO PRESERVE DEMOCRACY, IT IS NECESSARY TO LEAVE IT IDLE, AT THE MERCY OF VIOLENCE. OTHERS ARGUE THAT PEACE CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED IF WE DISMANTLE OUR CAPABILITY TO DEFEND DEMOCRACY. WE DO NOT AGREE. THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONFIRMED THAT STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY AND THE QUEST FOR PEACE ARE NOT ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH IMPROVING AND STRENGTHENING THE ARMED FORCES, BUT THAT THIS IS INDISPENSABLE FOR ADVANCING THE POLITICAL HANDLING OF VIOLENCE. EFFICIENT, PROFESSIONAL ARMED FORCES THAT SERVE THE COUNTRY ARE A DEFINITE GUARANTEE OF THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS AND OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE. THAT IS WHY THIS GOVERNMENT HAS MADE A GREAT ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL EFFORT TO RETURN TO THE MILITARY INSTITUTIONS COMPLETE FREEDOM OF ACTION. THIS COMMEMORATION OF THE 170TH ANNIVERSARY OF OUR INDEPENDENCE IS A SUITABLE TIME TO PONDER OUR DUTY TO THE HOMELAND. I AM NOT REFERRING TO DAILY CIVIC DUTIES, WHICH ARE PROPER TO ALL OF US COLOMBIANS, BUT TO SOMETHING MUCH DEEPER -- LOYALTY TO DEMOCRACY AND OUR INSTITUTIONS. DEMOCRACY'S BOUNDARIES ARE BROAD, BUT PRECISE. WHEN VIOLENCE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT IS TOLERATED, MORE VIOLENCE IS CREATED, THERE IS A CONSPIRACY AGAINST PEACE, AND CONFLICTS ARE AGGRAVATED. THE ENTIRE SOCIETY HAS SUFFERED BECAUSE OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ENEMIES OF COLOMBIA. I CONGRATULATE THE OFFICERS, CIVILIAN PERSONALITIES, SERGEANT AMAYA ALVAREZ, AND PRIVATE MALAMBO TIQUE, WHOSE MERITS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED TODAY IN THE NAME OF THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN AND THE GOVERNMENT. THIS CEREMONY, IN WHICH WE HONOR THE HEROES OF INDEPENDENCE AND THE ARMY, IS A SUITABLE OCCASION TO MAKE KNOWN TO OFFICERS, NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND SOLDIERS ALIKE THE NATION'S RECOGNITION OF THEIR COURAGEOUS AND PROFESSIONAL FULFILLMENT OF THEIR DUTIES. WHEN THE ARMED FORCES ACADEMIES PARADE BEFORE US, SO WILL THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO SERVING THE HOMELAND AND THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN. EVERY HONEST COLOMBIAN SUPPORTS THEM. SOLDIERS: YOU, WHO WIELD THE NATION'S ARMS, REPRESENT THE BASIC GUARANTEE THAT PRESERVES SOVEREIGNTY, LIBERTY, AND OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. THANK YOU.
DEV-MUC3-0340	GUATEMALA CITY, 10 AUG 89 -- THREE EXPLOSIONS ROCKED GUATEMALA CITY TODAY, LEAVING AT LEAST ONE DEAD, FIVE WOUNDED, AND VEHICLES AND STORES DAMAGED. THE MOST SERIOUS INCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS WHO THREW A GRENADE AT A PRIVATELY OWNED PASSENGER BUS ON KILOMETER 6 OF THE ROAD LINKING GUATEMALA CITY WITH PUERTO BARRIOS, ON THE ATLANTIC COAST. ONE PERSON WAS KILLED AND AT LEAST FIVE WERE WOUNDED IN THE ATTACK. THE FATALITY WAS AN UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN. ANOTHER EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE SIMULTANEOUSLY IN ZONE 5 OF GUATEMALA CITY, IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY PRIEST OF ARS, WHOSE PARISH PRIEST, JOSE MARIA RUIZ , WAS PREPARING TO SAY MASS. THREE VEHICLES WERE DAMAGED BY THIS EXPLOSION. THIS WEEK FATHER CHEMITA, FORMER CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR OF GUATEMALA CITY, ACCUSED ALFONSO CABRERA, FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER AND CURRENT SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY , OF "HAVING ORDERED" THE KILLING OF PDC LEADER DANILO BARILLAS. A THIRD EXPLOSION OCCURRED ON THE FIRST FLOOR OF A BUILDING IN GUATEMALA CITY'S ZONE 9. SEVERAL STORES WERE DAMAGED BY THE BLAST.
DEV-MUC3-0341	SANTIAGO, 11 AUG 89 -- PRESIDENT AUGUSTO PINOCHET HAS REQUESTED ALL HIS MINISTERS OF STATE TO RESIGN. THESE RESIGNATIONS WERE TENDERED IN A DOCUMENT SIGNED BY EACH MINISTER AND DELIVERED TO CABINET CHIEF CARLOS CACERES. THIS INFORMATION WAS DISCLOSED BY MINISTER SECRETARY GENERAL OF GOVERNMENT OSCAR VARGAS, WHO HAS ALSO RESIGNED, AT THE END OF A COUNCIL OF MINISTERS. VARGAS NOTED THAT THE NEW CABINET WILL BE SWORN IN ON WEDNESDAY, 16 AUGUST, AT 1800. THE FOLLOWING MINISTERS HAVE RESIGNED IN ORDER TO RUN AS SENATORIAL CANDIDATES DURING THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS: LABOR MINISTER GUILLERMO ARTHUR, WHO PLANS TO REPRESENT THE EIGHTH REGION, AND PUBLIC WORKS MINISTER BRUNO SIEBERT, WHO INTENDS TO REPRESENT THE TENCH REGION. ECONOMY MINISTER PABLO BARAONA WILL PROBABLY ALSO RUN FOR A CONGRESSIONAL SEAT. MINISTER VARGAS ALSO SAID THAT DURING THE MEETING THEY HAD DISCUSSED THE PUBLIC ORDER. HE ASSERTED THAT THE COUNTRY IS CALM, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TERRORIST ACTIONS BY THE LAUTARO MOVEMENT.
DEV-MUC3-0342	LIMA, 13 AUG 89 -- A SPOKESMAN FOR THE MINERS TODAY REPORTED IN LIMA THAT PERUVIAN SOLDIERS HAVE ARRESTED AT LEAST 22 MINERS, INCLUDING 4 REGIONAL LEADERS, ON THE EVE OF THE MINERS NATIONAL STRIKE, WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN ON 14 AUGUST. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 100,000 MINERS IN PERU. THE SPOKESMAN TOLD EFE THAT THE SOLDIERS ARRESTED MINERS AT THE LA OROYA, MOROCOCHA, CASA PALCA, AND AUSTRIA-DUVALZ MINING CAMPS IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE MOUNTAIN RANGE. IN LIMA, THE POLICE ARE LOOKING FOR THE MAIN LEADERS OF THE MINERS. THE FEDERATION OF MINERS AND METALWORKERS HAS CALLED A NATIONAL STRIKE FOR 14 AUGUST TO PRESSURE THE COURTS INTO RULING IN FAVOR OF A "SINGLE NATIONAL LIST OF DEMANDS," WHICH WILL ALLOW THE FEDERATION TO REPRESENT ALL PERUVIAN MINERS AT THE DISCUSSIONS OF LABOR AND SALARY ISSUES. ON FRIDAY, 11 AUGUST, THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT ORDERED ARMY SOLDIERS AND NAVY MARINES TO GUARD MINING CAMPS IN ORDER TO PREVENT POSSIBLE ATTACKS AND SABOTAGE DURING THE STRIKE, THE FIRST THIS YEAR. TERRORISTS HAVE ATTACKED SEVERAL MINES LATELY AND HAVE KILLED APPROXIMATELY 12 MINERS, INCLUDING SAUL CANTORAL, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE FEDERATION. THE MINERS WENT ON STRIKE FOR ALMOST 100 DAYS LAST YEAR. THAT STRIKE CAUSED LOSSES ESTIMATED AT $500 MILLION, ONE-THIRD OF PERU'S OVERALL MINING EXPORTS. THE STRIKE WILL AFFECT CENTRAL PERUVIAN MINING ENTERPRISE, THE LARGEST STATE-OWNED CORPORATION; THE U.S. COMPANY SOUTHERN PERU COPPER CORPORATION, WHICH EXPLOITS 75 PERCENT OF THE PERUVIAN COPPER; AND THE ILO REFINERY, THE SECOND LARGEST IN PERU.
DEV-MUC3-0343	NO CITY , NO DATE -- ARTICLE 5 ADDS: ALL MEN FROM 18 TO 50 YEARS OF AGE AND WOMEN FROM 18 TO 45 YEARS OF AGE ARE OBLIGED TO COMPLY WITH THIS LAW, THUS THIS PERIOD OF LIFE IS CALLED MILITARY AGE. THIS MEANS THAT ALL 18- TO 50-YEAR-OLD PERUVIANS ARE OF MILITARY AGE, AND WE ARE OBLIGED TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW, IN THE RESERVE. THEREFORE, ONE NOT ONLY COMPLIES WITH THE MILITARY SERVICE LAW WHEN ONE IS ASSIGNED ON ACTIVE DUTY TO A MILITARY GARRISON FOR 1 OR 2 YEARS, BUT ONE CONTINUES COMPLYING WITH THIS LAW BY REMAINING IN THE RESERVE UNTIL 50 YEARS OF AGE. ARTICLE 272 OF THE MILITARY SERVICE LAW STATES: MEN FROM 18 TO 50 YEARS OF AGE AND WOMEN BETWEEN 18 AND 45 YEARS OF AGE WHO ARE NOT ON ACTIVE MILITARY SERVICE ALL BELONG TO THE RESERVE, AND THEY MUST COMPLY WITH THE OBLIGATIONS ESTABLISHED BY CLAUSE 4 OF THIS LAW. IF THE LAW STATES THIS, I THEN ASK ALL PERUVIANS: ARE NOT TERRORISTS -- WHO ARE PART OF THE ARMED FORCES RESERVES AND WHO TAKE ARMS TO ATTACK THE NATIONAL POLICE AND ARMED FORCES -- VIOLATING THE OBLIGATORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW? IS NOT HE, WHO BY VIOLENT MEANS TRIES TO DESTROY THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM OF WHICH THE ARMED FORCES ARE PART, VIOLATING THE MILITARY SERVICE LAW? THEREFORE, SINCE ARTICLE 282 OF THE CONSTITUTION STATES THAT THOSE WHO VIOLATE THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW CAN BE TRIED BY THE MILITARY CODE OF JUSTICE, THEN TERRORISTS CAN BE TRIED BY MILITARY COURTS. THUS THE IDEA IS THAT ONE LAW, ONE ARTICLE, SHOULD ESTABLISH THAT THE CRIME OF TERRORISM VIOLATES THE MILITARY SERVICE LAW, THEREFORE ENABLING A QUICK AND DRASTIC PUNISHMENT FOR TERRORISTS. IT WILL THEREFORE NOT BE NECESSARY TO AMMEND THE CONSTITUTION. A CORRECT INTERPRETATION OF THE CONSTITUTION IS ALL THAT WILL BE NEEDED. WE MUST ALSO REMEMBER THAT WHEN THE CURRENT CONSTITUTION WAS APPROVED THERE WAS NO SERIOUS TERRORIST PROBLEM. BESIDES, YOU MUST KNOW THAT TO AMMEND THE CONSTITUTION WE MUST WAIT NEARLY 2 YEARS, AND WE HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE. MANY PERUVIANS THINK THAT IF MILITARY COURTS TRY TERRORISTS THEY WILL BE SENTENCED TO DEATH. THIS IS FALSE, IT IS NOT CORRECT. THE MILITARY COURTS WILL ONLY RULE SENTENCES IN KEEPING WITH THE LAW, BUT THESE SENTENCES WILL BE APPLIED FIRMLY. THIS MEANS THAT CRIMINALS WILL NOT GO UNPUNISHED. I ASK ALL PERUVIANS AND ALL INSTITUTIONS TO SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL. TERRORISTS MUST NOT REMAIN UNPUNISHED. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE DO NOT TRUST THE CIVILIAN COURTS. THIS MEANS THAT WE MUST SIMPLY INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION APPROPRIATELY. TERRORISTS REALLY DO VIOLATE THEIR CONDITION AS ARMED FORCES RESERVES WHEN THEY TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES. IT IS THEREFORE OUR PURPOSE TO DO THINGS CORRECTLY. THE CONSTITUTION MUST BE INTERPRETED IN FAVOR OF PERU, SINCE IT CANNOT BE INTERPRETED IN FAVOR OF THE TERRORISTS. I AM SURPRISED THAT ON THE ONE SIDE PEOPLE CRITICIZE THE LITTLE ACTION TAKEN AGAINST TERRORISTS, WHILE ON THE OTHER THEY DO NOT ACCEPT A CONCRETE INITIATIVE LIKE THIS ONE TO PUNISH THEM. THIS IS THE MOMENT TO RESUME THE DISCUSSION ON THIS SUBJECT BEFORE THE ELECTION CAMPAIGNS MAKE US FORGET THAT WE ARE AT WAR AGAINST TERRORISM. ON THE CONTRARY, IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD THE ELECTIONS WE MUST QUICKLY MAKE ALL THE IMPORTANT DECISIONS AND APPROVE STRICT PUNISHMENTS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO LIVE IN DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM, PEACE, AND SAFETY. THANK YOU.
DEV-MUC3-0344	LA PAZ, 12 AUG 89 -- DEFENSE MINISTER HECTOR HORMACHEA HAS REVEALED THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ASKED TO BE WITHDRAWN FROM THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING BECAUSE THAT MISSION HAS THE DIRECT PARTICIPATION OF THE POLICE. ORMACHEA EXPLAINED THAT THE ARMED FORCES' ROLE IN DRUG CONTROL WILL BE EVALUATED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY CHIEFS BEFORE A FINAL DECISION IS MADE. ORMACHEA MADE THESE COMMENTS DURING HIS FIRST NEWS CONFERENCE TO TALK ABOUT THE VARIOUS ISSUES RELATED TO HIS MINISTRY. HE ADDED THAT THE NAVY AND THE AIR FORCE CURRENTLY CARRY OUT A SUPPORT MISSION IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, AS THE ENTIRE TASK IS CARRIED OUT BY THE MOBIL UNITS FOR RURAL AREAS , WHICH ARE UNDER THE POLICE. IN HIS FIRST WEEK AS THE NEW MINISTER, ORMACHEA HELD PRELIMINARY TALKS WITH SEVERAL MILITARY CHIEFS TO GET FAMILIAR WITH THE ARMED FORCES' ROLE IN CONTROLLING DRUG TRAFFICKING. HE SAID: "WE MUST CAREFULLY STUDY AND EVALUATE THE SITUATION TO DETERMINE THE ARMED FORCES' DEGREE OF PARTICIPATION IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING." HE SAID THAT THE ARMED FORCES WANTED TO WITHDRAW FROM THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING WHEN IT INITIALLY BEGAN, BUT THEY THEN DECIDED TO CARRY OUT A SUPPORT MISSION. HE ADDED: WE ARE GOING TO STUDY THIS AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL, WITH THE PRESIDENT MAKING THE FINAL DECISION ON THE ROLE OF THE ARMED FORCES. ORMACHEA ALSO SAID THAT INTERNAL SECURITY IS CLOSELY LINKED TO HOW THE ARMED FORCES ARE EQUIPPED, BUT ALSO TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY IN THE POOREST ZONES AND BORDER AREAS. HE SAID THAT THERE HAS BEEN TALK LATELY ABOUT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, ALTHOUGH THE REPORTS HAVE NOT BEEN VERY CLEAR. THERE WERE APPARENTLY INCURSIONS BY UNIDENTIFIED ARMED GROUPS, MURDER, AND OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT MAY JEOPARDIZE THE COUNTRY'S INTERNAL SECURITY. ORMACHEA SAID THAT INTERNAL SECURITY AND NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE ARMED FORCES' MAIN CONCERN. REGARDING THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN MILITARY ADVISORS INVOLVED IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, ORMAECHEA NOTED THAT "THAT WORK WILL BE USEFUL AS LONG AS IT DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH THE WORK OF BOLIVIAN ORGANIZATIONS." HE CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT CHANGING THE PREVIOUS DEFENSE MINISTRY'S POLICY OF ADMINISTRATIVE CENTRALIZATION OF ECONOMIC RESOURCES IS A POSITIVE STEP.
DEV-MUC3-0345	BOGOTA, 16 AUG 89 -- A FEW MINUTES AGO, THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT ON THE LIFE OF CARLOS ERNESTO VALENCIA GARCIA, SUPERIOR CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE OF BOGOTA. HE IS IN CHARGE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS OF THE DEATHS OF GUILLERMO CANO, DIRECTOR OF THE NEWSPAPER EL ESPECTADOR, AND JAIME PARDO LEAL, THE PRESIDENT OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION. AT THIS TIME, HE AND ONE OF HIS BODYGUARDS ARE RECEIVING MEDICAL ATTENTION AT THE SAN PEDRO CLAVER CLINIC. WE HAVE RECEIVED A REPORT FROM DIANA MONTOYA FROM THE SCENE OF THE ATTACK IN DOWNTOWN BOGOTA. JUDGE VALENCIA GARCIA WAS SHOT A FEW MINUTES AGO HERE ON 13TH STREET AND 16TH AVENUE. JUDGE VALENCIA GARCIA WAS APPARENTLY TRAVELING HOME WHEN HE WAS INTERCEPTED BY FOUR INDIVIDUALS ON TWO MOTORCYCLES. THEY FLED AFTER THE ATTACK TOWARD WESTERN BOGOTA. THE DOCTORS TREATING JUDGE VALENCIA GARCIA HAVE SAID THAT HE IS IN CRITICAL CONDITION AFTER BEING SHOT THREE TIMES IN THE HEAD.
DEV-MUC3-0346	BOGOTA, 16 AUG 89 -- SUPERIOR CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE CARLOS VALENCIA GARCIA DIED AFTER HE WAS SHOT TODAY NEAR DOWNTOWN BOGOTA BY TWO MEN TRAVELING ON TWO MOTORCYCLES, POLICE SOURCES REPORTED. TWO MEMBERS OF THE JUDGE'S ESCORT, MEMBERS OF THE SECRET POLICE, WERE WOUNDED DURING THE ATTACK, THE SOURCES ADDED. THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE AT APPROXIMATELY 1845 AT THE INTERSECTION OF TWO VERY CROWDED AVENUES. THE JUDGE, 45 YEARS OLD, MARRIED, AND THE FATHER OF THREE CHILDREN, WAS INVESTIGATING THE ASSASSINATIONS OF EL ESPECTADOR DIRECTOR GUILLERMO CANO, PERPETRATED IN DECEMBER 1986, AND OF JAIME PARDO LEAL, FORMER PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER OF THE LEFT-WING PATRIOTIC UNION, KILLED ON 11 OCTOBER 1987. KINGPINS FROM THE DRUG TRAFFICKING MEDELLIN CARTEL AND FROM FAR RIGHT-WING ARMED ORGANIZATIONS WERE INVOLVED IN THESE TWO CRIMES.
DEV-MUC3-0347	BOGOTA, 17 AUG 89 -- COLOMBIA IS IN UTTER CHAOS TODAY. THE COUNTRY'S MAGISTRATES RESIGNED TODAY TO PROTEST THE MURDER OF COLOMBIAN JUSTICE CARLOS VALENCIA, AND A FEW MINUTES AGO THE ASONAL JUDGES ALSO TENDERED THEIR RESIGNATIONS. MEANWHILE, THE GOVERNMENT IS DESPERATELY ATTEMPTING TO CONVINCE THEM TO GO BACK TO THEIR JOBS. TODAY, THE 54 MAGISTRATES WHO COMPOSE THE CIVIL, LABOR, AND PENAL COURTS OF THE BOGOTA SUPERIOR TRIBUNAL TENDERED THEIR RESIGNATIONS UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES THEM SAFETY AND PROTECTION FOR THEIR LIVES SO THAT THEY CAN DISPENSE JUSTICE IN COLOMBIA. THE MURDER OF JUSTICE CARLOS VALENCIA GARCIA LED THE COLOMBIAN MAGISTRATES TO SUSPEND ALL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. THE MAGISTRATES OF THE BOGOTA SUPERIOR TRIBUNAL SAID THEY DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY BUT ADDED THAT THEY DO NOT WANT TO BE THE NEXT VICTIMS EITHER. WE FEEL WE ARE WAGING A USELESS STRUGGLE. WE ARE FIGHTING FOR IDEALS THAT NOBODY SHARES. WHAT WE WANT IS FOR THE COUNTRY TO BEGIN TO SHARE THOSE IDEALS. WHEN THAT HAPPENS, WE, THE COLOMBIAN JUDGES, WILL BE WILLING TO GIVE UP OUR LIVES FOR THOSE IDEALS AS CARLOS VALENCIA GARCIA DID. THE 22,000 JUDICIAL BRANCH EMPLOYEES JOINED THE MAGISTRATES' PROTEST. THE JUDICIAL BRANCH PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION CALLED FOR AN INDEFINITE STRIKE, BEGINNING TODAY. THE GOVERNMENT'S PROMISES HAVE BEEN ONLY THAT, PROMISES. THE TRUTH IS THAT THE PLAN TO PROVIDE PROTECTION, ESCORTS, AND ARMORED VEHICLES HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE THAT TO END THIS WAVE OF MURDERS THE GOVERNMENT MUST SHOW THE POLITICAL RESOLVE TO ERADICATE IT. THE GOVERNMENT MUST CONFRONT THIS PROBLEM BY USING OUR ARMED FORCES WITH DUE RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. AS LONG AS THAT IS NOT DONE, NOT ONLY JUDGES, BUT THE BEST CHILDREN OF COLOMBIA, WILL CONTINUE TO DIE. THE WIFE OF THE MURDERED MAGISTRATE ARRIVED FROM GUATEMALA TODAY FOR THE FUNERAL.
DEV-MUC3-0348	BOGOTA, 18 AUG 89 -- MEDELLIN -- ANTIOQUIA POLICE DEPARTMENT CHIEF WALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO WAS MURDERED THIS MORNING ON THIS CITY'S WEST SIDE. THE GUNMEN FIRED ON THE POLICE COMMANDER WHEN HIS VEHICLE STOPPED FOR A RED LIGHT AT ROAD 80 AND 48TH STREET, NEAR MARTIN RODRIGUEZ VELODROME, A FEW BLOCKS AWAY FROM WHERE THE GOVERNOR OF ANTIOQUIA WAS MURDERED ON 4 JULY. THE AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE, WHICH LASTED OVER 3 MINUTES, ALSO SERIOUSLY WOUNDED ONE OF THE AGENTS ACCOMPANYING COL QUINTERO. ACCORDING TO POLICE SOURCES, THE POLICE CHIEF'S WHITE NISSAN PICKUP, WITH LICENSE PLATES ME-7847, WAS INTERCEPTED BY ASSASSINS' GRAY MAZDA, LICENSE PLATES MI-1630. A CRIMINAL COURT JUSTICE IDENTIFIED THE BODY OF THE POLICE COMMANDER MURDERED THIS MORNING IN SALASAN, ON THIS CITY'S WEST SIDE. THE POLICE CHIEF WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD SEVERAL TIMES. POLICE UNITS AND SECURITY CORPS AGENTS HAVE REINFORCED STRATEGIC POINTS IN MEDELLIN AND POLICE CHECKPOINTS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN THE SEARCH FOR THE CRIMINALS. A METROPOLITAN POLICE OFFICER HAS REPORTED THAT FOR THE PAST WEEK, POLICE CHIEF QUINTERO HAD BEEN WITHOUT A PERSONAL ESCORT. THE POLICE CHIEF HAD EXPLAINED THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO RISK OTHER POLICEMEN'S LIVES. HE DISMISSED HIS PERSONAL ESCORTS, APPOINTING THEM TO OTHER DUTIES. THE POLICE COMMANDER'S ASSASSINATION HAS CREATED A LOT OF COMMOTION IN COLOMBIAN SOCIETY. ANTIOQUIA GOVERNOR ELENA MONTOYA HAS STATED HER CONCERN OVER THIS NEW EPISODE OF SELECTIVE VIOLENCE AND POINTED OUT THE EFFORTS THAT THE POLICE COMMANDER HAD BEEN MAKING TO PROVIDE SECURITY TO THE CITIZENS OF THIS REGION. METROPOLITAN POLICE CHIEF ANTONIO SANCHEZ HAS REJECTED THIS NEW ACT OF VIOLENCE AGAINST THE POLICE AS AN INSTITUTION. THE MEDELLIN SECURITY COUNCIL WILL INITIATE A SPECIAL MEETING IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES TO ANALYZE THE SITUATION. COMMANDER QUINTERO FOUGHT DRUG-TRAFFICKING AND SUBVERSION IN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT. FROM THE MOMENT HE BECAME ANTIOQUIA POLICE COMMANDER, QUINTERO BECAME KNOWN FOR HIS EXERCISE OF AUTHORITY AND FOR DESIGNING STRATEGIES DESIGNED TO PROVIDE PUBLIC ORDER. ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS HE PARTICIPATED IN REGIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL MEETINGS WHERE WAYS TO FIGHT CRIME IN ANTIOQUIA WERE DISCUSSED. LAST WEDNESDAY HE ACCOMPANIED GOVERNOR MONTOYA TO TOLIMA FOR A SECURITY MEETING TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION IN THE REGIONS. AT THAT MEETING, MEASURES WERE ESTABLISHED TO FIGHT SUBVERSION AND COMMON CRIMINALS.
DEV-MUC3-0349	BOGOTA, 18 AUG 89 -- IT WAS OFFICIALLY REPORTED TODAY THAT 800 COLOMBIAN ARMY AND POLICE MEMBERS WERE TAKEN FROM BOGOTA ON BOARD FOUR PLANES TODAY AND DEPLOYED IN THE CITY OF MEDELLIN TO REINFORCE THE MEDELLIN AUTHORITIES. A NATIONAL POLICE SOURCE TOLD EFE THAT THE 800 MEN "ARE PART OF A GROUP CHOSEN BY THE POLICE AND ARMY TO COUNTERATTACK CRIME IN MEDELLIN." THE DEPLOYMENT WAS ORDERED BY THE POLICE AND ARMY HIGH COMMAND AS A RESULT OF THE MURDER OF ANTIOQUIA POLICE CHIEF COLONEL WALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO TODAY IN MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA'S SECOND LARGEST CITY. ACCORDING TO EYE WITNESSES, QUINTERO WAS FIRED AT "INCESSANTLY" IN A DOWNTOWN MEDELLIN STREET AT 0600 LOCAL TIME AFTER HIS CAR WAS INTERCEPTED BY ANOTHER VEHICLE FROM WHICH VARIOUS UNIDENTIFIED MEN GOT OUT TO COMMIT THE CRIME. COL FRANKLIN QUINTERO, CONSIDERED BY HIS SUPERIORS AS AN IMPLACABLE ENEMY OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND ORGANIZED CRIME, WAS KILLED IN THE ACTION. THE COLOMBIAN DEPUTY POLICE DIRECTOR, GENERAL CARLOS ARTURO CASADIEGO, SAID: "IT IS NO SECRET THAT THE MEDELLIN MAFIA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE CRIMES" TAKING PLACE IN THE COUNTRY. QUINTERO'S MURDER JOINS THAT OF MAGISTRATE CARLOS VALENCIA GARCIA. WHO WAS MURDERED IN BOGOTA ON 16 AUGUST. AT THE TIME OF HIS MURDER, VALENCIA WAS INVESTIGATING THE MEDELLIN CARTEL'S CHIEFS' LINKS.
DEV-MUC3-0350	BOGOTA, 18 AUG 89 -- FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: I AM ADDRESSING YOU TO EXPLAIN THE MEASURES UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE STATE OF SIEGE WHICH HAVE BEEN ADOPTED AT A TIME WHEN THE NATION HAS JUSTIFIED REASONS TO FEEL ANGRY AND MOVED BY THE SERIOUS ACTIONS OF VIOLENCE THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN RECENT DAYS. UNFORTUNATELY, LUIS CARLOS GALAN, THE LIBERAL PARTY PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL, WAS THE VICTIM OF ANOTHER ATTACK TONIGHT. SENATOR GALAN HAS BEEN TAKEN TO A HOSPITAL. LET US PRAY TO GOD THAT HE WILL RECOVER FROM HIS WOUNDS. THE CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS AND THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS HAVE UNLEASHED A WAVE OF ASSASSINATIONS AND DEATHS. THERE HAVE BEEN ATTACKS AGAINST REPRESENTATIVES AND LEADERS FROM ALL SECTORS OF THE COUNTRY AND FROM ALL INSTITUTIONS. HIGH-RANKING GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, SEVERAL JUDGES, POLITICAL LEADERS, SOLDIERS, CITIZENS, AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN THE VICTIMS OF THIS BARBARISM. VIOLENCE AFFECTS ALL. IT IS NOT AN OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OR AGAINST JUSTICE; IT IS A WAR AGAINST THE COUNTRY. THEREFORE, THE ENTIRE COUNTRY MUST RESPOND. I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THE MURDER OF MAGISTRATE CARLOS VALENCIA LED THE JUDGES OF THE REPUBLIC TO PROTEST AND TO REQUEST MORE PROTECTION, BUT FOR THE MAGISTRATES AND JUDGES TO RESIGN ONLY CONTRIBUTES TO WORSENING THE SITUATION WHICH WE MUST ALL SOLVE BY WORKING TOGETHER. THIS IS ALSO EQUIVALENT TO YIELDING TO THE TERRORISTS WHO ARE TRYING TO PARALYZE THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. TRUE HEROES SUCH AS CARLOS VALENCIA, WALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO, AND OTHER JUDGES, POLICEMEN, SOLDIERS, AND BODYGUARDS HAVE PREVENTED THIS BY FULFILLING THEIR DUTIES WITHOUT YIELDING TO INTIMIDATION OR BRIBERY. I INVITE ALL JUDGES OF THE REPUBLIC TO RESUME THEIR WORK. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ADOPTED MORE MEASURES TO PROTECT THEM, AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO RENDER ALL THE COOPERATION THEY REQUIRE AND WHICH IS AVAILABLE. ALL GOOD COLOMBIANS MUST JOIN THE EFFORTS. NO MORE LAMENTATIONS WITHOUT TRUE ACTION OF COOPERATION WITH THE AUTHORITIES. IT IS NECESSARY THAT ALL FORCES OF THE STATE AND OF SOCIETY -- POLITICAL PARTIES, UNIONS, MEDIA, CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS -- ALL SERVE JUSTICE AND THE STRUGGLE AGAINST CRIME. WE MUST BE PREPARED TO ENDURE MORE SORROW AND SUFFERINGS. ONLY IF ALL COLOMBIA PERSEVERES IN A TRULY STRONG AND SOLID MANNER -- BUT NOT JUST WITH WORDS -- IN THE DIFFICULT BATTLE AGAINST CRIME, WILL WE BE ABLE TO BANISH VIOLENCE.
DEV-MUC3-0351	BOGOTA, 18 AUG 89 -- SENATOR LUIS CARLOS GALAN, LIBERAL PARTY PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL, WAS SHOT THIS EVENING WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TO GIVE A SPEECH AT MAIN SQUARE OF SOACHA, 15 KM SOUTH OF BOGOTA, IT WAS CONFIRMED BY POLICE AND HEALTH AUTHORITIES. ACCORDING TO THE FIRST REPORTS, AT LEAST ONE MAN FIRED ON THE SENATOR FROM AMONG THOSE GATHERED. THE SENATOR IS CURRENTLY AT THE EMERGENCY ROOM OF A HOSPITAL IN BOSA, CLOSE TO SOACHA. TWO OTHER PERSONS WERE WOUNDED DURING THE ATTACK.
DEV-MUC3-0352	BOGOTA, 18 AUG 89 -- THE MEDICAL AUTHORITIES HAVE REPORTED THAT LUIS CARLOS CARLOS GALAN, SENATOR AND PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL, DIED TONIGHT 2 HOURS AFTER HAVING BEEN SHOT IN AN ATTACK. GALAN, 46, WAS MACHINEGUNNED TOGETHER WITH FIVE OTHER PERSONS WHO WERE WOUNDED WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TO DELIVER A SPEECH TONIGHT IN SOACHA, NEAR BOGOTA.
DEV-MUC3-0353	BOGOTA, 19 AUG 89 -- THAT MEASURE WILL BE COMPLEMENTED WITH A DECREE -- WHICH FALLS UNDER THE PROVISION OF THE STATE OF SIEGE -- ACCORDING TO WHICH THOSE WHO WITH THE EXCUSE OF CARRYING OUT POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS OR OTHER ELECTION ACTIVITIES USE WEAPONS OR THREATEN PEOPLE BY OTHER MEANS TO OBTAIN SUPPORT OR VOTES FOR A SPECIFIC CANDIDATE OR LIST OF CANDIDATES AND ACCORDING TO WHICH THOSE WHO USING THOSE SAME MEANS PREVENT A CITIZEN FROM EXERCISING HIS RIGHT TO VOTE, WILL BE IMPRISONED FOR 3 TO 6 YEARS AND WILL HAVE TO PAY A FINE EQUIVALENT TO 10 TO 50 TIMES THE LEGAL MONTHLY MINIMUM WAGE. AS FOR THE MEDIA, WHOSE ROLE IS ESSENTIAL IN THE MAINTENANCE OF PUBLIC ORDER IN THE COUNTRY, I WOULD ONLY STATE THAT THE CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES THEM FULL FREEDOM IN TIMES OF PEACE, BUT THEY WILL BE HELD RESPONSIBLE BEFORE THE LAW WHEN THEY ATTACK PEOPLE'S HONOR, SOCIAL ORDER, OR PUBLIC TRANQUILLITY. THE GOVERNMENT WILL THEN ENFORCE THOSE LAWS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONSTITUTION. BASED ON SPECIAL POWERS, TODAY THE GOVERNMENT ISSUED OTHER DECREES THAT THE NATIONAL CONGRESS APPROVED ON A GOVERNMENT REQUEST. I WILL MENTION ONLY ONE OF THOSE DECREES. THIS DECREE AMENDS OUR PENAL CODE. THE PUBLIC NAMING OF JURORS WILL BE ELIMINATED. ORGANIZED CRIME TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT JURY APPOINTMENT SYSTEM AND AVOIDED THE ACTION OF JUSTICE BY INTIMIDATING JURORS. THE NEW DECREE REDUCES FORMALITIES AND CREATES ROVING JUDGES WHO WILL HAVE AUTHORITY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, THUS INCREASING THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. THOSE JUDGES WILL JUDGE ANY CRIME THAT WILL BE GIVEN SPECIAL IMPORTANCE FOR REASONS OF PUBLIC ORDER. THESE MEASURES HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY STUDIED. THAT, HOWEVER, DOES NOT MEAN THEY CANNOT BE SUPPLEMENTED IN THE FUTURE IF NECESSARY. WHEN DRAFTING THESE DECREES WE, AS USUAL, PAID DUE ATTENTION TO THE HONORABLE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE'S DECISIONS SO THAT THE CURRENT DECREES FOLLOW ALONG WITH THE GUIDELINES OF THE CONSTITUTION. THE THREAT THAT DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND ORGANIZED CRIME REPRESENT JUSTIFIES THE SEVERITY OF THE MEASURES WE HAVE ADOPTED. COLOMBIANS CAN BE SURE WE WILL CONTINUE MAKING ALL THE NECESSARY EFFORTS TO REGAIN TRANQUILLITY IN COLOMBIA. I AM SURE WE WILL OVERCOME THESE DIFFICULTIES. A HANDFUL OF CRIMINALS WILL NOT DEFEAT A UNIFIED NATION THAT IS WILLING TO STRUGGLE AGAINST CRIME. WE ARE CERTAINLY EXPERIENCING A DIFFICULT TIME. HOWEVER, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED EVEN MORE DIFFICULT SITUATIONS AND COLOMBIA OVERCAME THEM. WE MUST NOT STRAY FROM OUR PATH, BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THE CRIMINALS WANT. BY FALLING INTO DESPAIR WE WILL BE PLAYING THE TERRORISTS' GAME. IF WE CONTINUE AHEAD FIRMLY AND DECISIVELY, WE WILL HAVE MUCH BETTER RESULTS. INSTEAD OF WASTING OUR TIME IN DISPUTES AND RECIPROCAL REPROACHES, LET US UNITE OUR ACTIONS AGAINST OUR COMMON ENEMY. WE MUST WIN THIS WAR. I AM SURE WE WILL SUCCEED. GOOD EVENING AND SEE YOU SOON.
DEV-MUC3-0354	BOGOTA, 19 AUG 89 -- COLOMBIAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HAVE ANNOUNCED THE SUSPENSION OF THEIR POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS. ALL THE POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE UNANIMOUSLY REJECTED THE MURDER OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN. THE WAVE OF POLITICAL MURDERS HAS LEFT THE COUNTRY IN A STATE OF SHOCK. FOLLOWING ARE SOME REACTIONS VOICED TODAY AT THE WAKE FOR THE MURDERED LIBERAL CANDIDATE: THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN ATTACKED FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS AND IT HAS NOT ACCEPTED THIS FACT. I HAVE REPEATEDLY ASKED FOR A STATE OF SIEGE TO BE IMPLEMENTED. AT LAST, THE STATE OF SIEGE WAS DECLARED YESTERDAY. I HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR THIS FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS. GALAN WOULD NOT BE DEAD TODAY IF THE PROPOSAL WE MADE 3 YEARS AGO WOULD HAD BEEN ACCEPTED. IT WAS RIGHT TO CALL FOR A REACTION FROM THE COUNTRY; WE HAVE TO LEARN TO REACT, AND IT IS NECESSARY TO DO SO.
DEV-MUC3-0355	BOGOTA, 19 AUG 89 -- GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA, CHIEF OF THE COLOMBIAN SECRET POLICE, WARNED THE COUNTRY TODAY THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS "WILL CONTINUE TO SHOOT," AND ANNOUNCED AN ALL-OUT DECLARATION OF WAR AGAINST THEM. MAZA, WHO 1 MONTH AGO ESCAPED MIRACULOUSLY FROM A CAR BOMB ATTACK STAGED BY THE DRUG MAFIA, WARNED ABOUT THE "WAR" THAT THE "DRUG LORDS" HAVE UNLEASHED AGAINST THE COUNTRY, NOTING THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO FIRE THEIR WEAPONS. THE POLICE CHIEF DECLARED THAT THE STATE ORGANIZATIONS FIGHTING CRIMINALITY WILL STRUGGLE AGAINST THOSE WHO SEEK BY THEIR CRIMINAL ACTIONS TO IMPOSE THEIR OWN LAWS. ALSO, MAZA DIRECTLY ACCUSED THE DRUG CARTELS OF BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CHAIN OF ASSASSINATIONS THAT HAVE SHAKEN THE COUNTRY OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS. "WE ALL KNOW WHO THEY ARE AND WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT THEM," HE WARNED. THE SEVERE MEASURES ADOPTED LAST NIGHT BY THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBERAL PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, AFTER THE KILLINGS DURING THE PAST 72 HOURS OF A JUDGE, A POLICE COMMANDER, AND PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LUIS CARLOS GALAN, WILL PERMIT THE SECURITY CORPS TO FORCEFULLY CONFRONT THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE THAT HAS GRIPPED COLOMBIA, HE DECLARED.
DEV-MUC3-0356	MONTEVIDEO , 17 AUG 89 -- ARGENTINA HAS REQUESTED THE ARREST OF TWO WELL KNOWN LEADERS OF THE MONTONEROS TERRORIST GROUP, WHO ARE THOUGHT TO BE LIVING IN MONTEVIDEO. THEIR NAMES ARE: ROBERTO PERDIA AND FERNANDO VACA NARVAJA, WHO TOGETHER WITH THE IMPRISONED LEADER MARIO FIRMENICH WERE THE TOP CHIEFS OF THE MONTONEROS GROUP IN ARGENTINA.
DEV-MUC3-0357	CARACAS , 20 AUG 89 -- THE COLOMBIAN-VENEZUELAN BORDER HAS BEEN DECLARED AN EMERGENCY AREA BY THE COLOMBIAN SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS, WHILE THE ENTRY OF VENEZUELANS TO THE NEIGHBORING TERRITORY HAS BEEN RESTRICTED AS A RESULT OF THE SECURITY CRISIS AFFECTING COLOMBIA, A CARACAS NEWSPAPER HAS REPORTED. WHILE THE VENEZUELAN NEWSPAPERS REPORTED THE INDIGNATION OF ALL THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND PEOPLE IN GENERAL CAUSED BY THE ASSASSINATION OF COLOMBIAN POLITICAL LEADER LUIS CARLOS GALAN, NEWSMEN WAITED TO BE ALLOWED TO ENTER COLOMBIA.
DEV-MUC3-0358	BOGOTA, 20 AUG 89 -- AFTER THE ASSASSINATION OF LIBERAL LEADER LUIS CARLOS GALAN, THE 4,015 JUDGES OF THE COUNTRY DECIDED TO LIFT THE STRIKE THEY HAD CALLED ON 17 AUGUST, FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION OF A MAGISTRATE, AND WITHDREW THEIR RESIGNATIONS. IT IS NOT THE MOMENT TO GO ON STRIKE OR TO RESIGN, JOSE GABRIEL SALOM, PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME TRIBUNAL OF BOGOTA, STATED. HE AND 47 COLLEAGUES HAD PRESENTED THEIR RESIGNATION LAST FRIDAY TO PROTEST THE ASSASSINATION OF MAGISTRATE CARLOS VALENCIA GARCIA, PRESUMABLY BY PAID ASSASSINS OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS. VALENCIA GARCIA HAD REJECTED THE APPEALS TO EXONERATE PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA AND GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, KINGPINS OF THE COCAINE TRAFFICKING GROUP OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, FROM THE CHARGE THAT THEY HAD MASTERMINDED THE ASSASSINATION OF JOURNALIST GUILLERMO CANO, DIRECTOR OF THE NEWSPAPER EL ESPECTADOR, AND JAIME PARDO LEAL, PRESIDENT OF THE OPPOSITION PARTY PATRIOTIC UNION. ANTONIO SUAREZ, PRESIDENT OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION, ANNOUNCED THAT THE STRIKE HAS BEEN CALLED OFF AND THAT NINE JUDGES ARE INVESTIGATING THE ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR GALAN. THE JUDICIAL BRANCH WILL RESUME ACTIVITIES ON TUESDAY. THE STRIKE OF THE JUDGES, COMPOUNDED BY THE RESIGNATION OF SOME OF THEM, INTERRUPTED THE CONSIDERATION OF THREE CASES. THE STRIKE WAS ALSO CALLED TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO TO ADOPT MEASURES TO PROTECT THE MAGISTRATES WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN THREATENED BY ORGANIZED CRIME. AMONG THE EMERGENCY MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT ARE SOME THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO HELPING THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO CONFRONT THE THREAT POSED BY THE DEATH SQUADS OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS.
DEV-MUC3-0359	SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE -- THIS OFFICIAL TOLD YOU THAT? DOES THIS OFFICIAL, WHOSE NAME YOU DO NOT DISCLOSE, HAVE CREDIBILITY WITH THE GOVERNMENT? ALLOW ME TO RESERVE THE IDENTITY OF THE SOURCE, BUT HE DOES HAVE MUCH CREDIBILITY. HE IS SOMEONE WHO IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT MOVEMENT, AND HE DOES HAVE CREDIBILITY. THE INTERESTING ASPECT OF THIS IS THE WAY THIS BIG MANGY DOG, THIS MR VILLALOBOS, THINKS. IF HE WANTS TO COME HERE AND PARTICIPATE, WE'LL TAKE HIS WORD, AND LET US SEE IF HE WILL REALLY HAVE A LANDSLIDE VICTORY. WOULD THERE BE ANY GUARANTEES FOR HIS PARTICIPATION? DIDN'T I JUST TELL YOU THAT THE FIRST MANGY DOGS, UNGO AND ZAMORA, ARE ALREADY HERE? WE DO HAVE THE BEST OF INTENTIONS; THERE IS A WILLINGNESS TO DO THIS. NOW, IF THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO DO IT, THAT IS A DIFFERENT STORY. I AM JUST TELLING YOU ABOUT THE FIRST INDICATIONS WE HAVE HAD, IN ADDITION TO SOME NOTES ON THE ELECTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SENT BY SOME WHO CLAIM TO BE COMMANDERS. THE OVERALL PICTURE HAS CHANGED SOMEWHAT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. WHAT IS THAT CHANGE, MAJOR? IN PRACTICALLY ALL OF THE NOTES THEY HAVE SENT, INCLUDING THE ONES SENT PRIOR TO THE ELECTIONS, THEY SAID THAT IF THE ELECTIONS WERE POSTPONED THEY WOULD PARTICIPATE. THAT IS AN INDICATION THAT THEY DO HAVE PLANS TO JOIN THE PROCESS. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN, MAJOR? IT MEANS TWO BASIC THINGS: ONE, THEY ARE LOST. THE OPTION TO SEIZE POWER THROUGH VIOLENT MEANS NO LONGER EXISTS. IN OTHER WORDS, THEY ARE LOST IN THE MILITARY FIELD? THEY ARE LOST BOTH IN THE MILITARY FIELD AND IN THE OPTION TO SEIZE POWER THROUGH VIOLENT MEANS. SECOND, THEY NO LONGER HAVE THE SUPPORT, AND WE HAVE BEEN ANALYZING THAT FOR SOME TIME NOW. THERE IS NO LONGER ANY SUPPORT FOR THIS TYPE OF REBEL MOVEMENT, FOR THIS TYPE OF ARMED REBEL MOVEMENT TO SEIZE POWER. YOU MEAN SUPPORT FROM THE USSR? THERE IS NO SUPPORT FROM THE COMMUNIST WORLD IN GENERAL. NATURALLY, THIS IS BASED VERY MUCH ON THE SO-CALLED PERESTROYKA. THEREFORE, THEY WILL HAVE TO JOIN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY ARE GOING TO BE LEFT OUT. IF THEY WANT TO CONTINUE SHOOTING BULLETS JUST FOR THE SAKE OF SHOOTING, THEY ARE GOING TO BE LEFT OUT OF EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE. THERE IS MUCH TALK HERE ABOUT FORMING AN INTERNAL OPPOSITION FRONT; I BELIEVE THIS IS PART OF THE "EVERYONE AGAINST ARENA" CAMPAIGN. DO YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THIS AND THE LINE THIS INTERNAL FRONT MIGHT FOLLOW? WELL, NOT EXACTLY. HOWEVER, IT IS LOGICAL THAT AN INTERNAL POLITICAL FRONT COULD BE FORMED. THAT WOULD BE A POLITICAL PROCESS WITHIN A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. IT IS ALL RIGHT TO DO THAT. THEY HAVE ALL THE RIGHT IN THE WORLD TO DO THAT. NOW, THERE ARE SUBVERSIVE THOUGHTS. WE ARE REFERRING TO THOSE BIG MANGY DOGS WHO WANT TO TAKE THE FIRST STEPS IN JOINING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY ARE SUBVERSIVE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DISRUPTING PUBLIC ORDER. IF WHAT THEY WANT IS TO CAUSE HARM AND HINDER THE PROGRAMS PREPARED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI AND HIS CABINET, THEY ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO IT ANYHOW. REMEMBER THAT VERY SIMPLE PHRASE I TOLD YOU AT THE BEGINNING. THEY CLAIM THAT IF ARENA FAILS, THEY ARE THE ALTERNATIVE. THAT IS WHAT THE GROUP OF UNGO, ZAMORA, AND ALL THOSE REALLY THINKS. THERE IS ANOTHER GREAT POSSIBILITY, AND THAT IS WHAT IS REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN HERE: ARENA WILL NOT FAIL. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL NOT FAIL. HOWEVER, THEY ARE GOING TO TRY ALL THE ILLEGAL, SUBVERSIVE ACTIONS THEY CAN TO MAKE US FAIL.
DEV-MUC3-0360	SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE -- ONCE THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT THE SITUATION IN THE RURAL AREAS, HARASSMENTS AND ASSASSINATIONS BEGAN SO AS TO GET OUR ATTENTION. THIS WAS BECAUSE THE COMMUNISTS KNOW THAT THE RURAL AREAS HAVE REACTED FAVORABLY. THEY HAVE ALREADY REACHED THE CONCLUSION THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGRARIAN REFORM, WHICH SHOULD BE PERMANENT. THE AGRARIAN REFORM PROCESS CAN BE MADE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS AND THE CONSTITUTION WITHOUT RESORTING TO VIOLENCE. THE AGRARIAN REFORM CAN BE PRODUCTIVE, AND THAT IS OUR GOAL. THE AGRARIAN REFORM IN OUR COUNTRY WILL BE MADE PRODUCTIVE. THERE WERE REPORTS THAT PEASANTS WERE CONCERNED BECAUSE SIX CASES HAD BEEN DECIDED IN FAVOR OF THE LANDOWNERS AND THE LANDS WERE LEGALLY TURNED OVER TO THE OWNERS. I DO NOT KNOW IF THERE WERE SIX OR MORE CASES. IF WE LOOK AT IT FROM THE LEGAL POINT OF VIEW, SERIOUS MISTAKES WERE MADE WHEN THE LANDS WERE VIOLENTLY OCCUPIED. MANY LANDS WERE IMPROPERLY OCCUPIED. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE POLITICAL ASPECTS OF THIS. WE ARE LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS FOR THESE PEOPLE. IF THEY CANNOT STAY ON THOSE LANDS, THEY CAN TAKE OTHER LANDS, BECAUSE THERE ARE ABOUT 33 LAND TRACTS THAT HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY ABANDONED. REFUGEES AND ARMY FAMILIES MAY BE BROUGHT TO THOSE REGIONS. EVEN THOSE WHO DISAGREE WITH OUR AGRARIAN REFORM PLAN CAN GO THERE. NO ONE WILL BE ABANDONED. WHERE ARE THOSE 33 LAND TRACTS? IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. IN GENERAL TERMS, AND TO END THIS INTERVIEW, DO YOU BELIEVE THIS 5-YEAR PERIOD WILL BE ONE OF PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT IN EL SALVADOR? YES, AND WE ARE SURE THAT WE WILL WIN THE ELECTIONS IN THE FIRST ROUND IN 1994. IN THIS 5-YEAR PERIOD WE WILL ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF HAVING AN HONEST GOVERNMENT AND OF BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS OURSELVES DEMOCRATICALLY. THERE WILL BE PRODUCTIVITY AND THE PEOPLE OF EL SALVADOR WILL ONCE AGAIN FEEL PROUD OF BEING SALVADORANS. WE WILL NO LONGER NEED OTHERS TO DONATE THINGS TO US BECAUSE WE CAN PRODUCE THEM HERE. WE WILL CONTINUE WORKING TO RESCUE THIS SHIP SO THAT IT CAN SAIL EFFICIENTLY. MAJOR, WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR VISITING US TODAY AND FOR DISCUSSING ALL OF THE ISSUES WE COVERED. IT HAS BEEN INTERESTING TO LISTEN TO YOUR POINTS OF VIEW AND THOSE OF YOUR PARTY REGARDING THE VARIOUS ISSUES. THANK YOU. THIS HAS BEEN AN INTERESTING INTERVIEW. I WILL ALWAYS BE WILLING TO COME BACK HERE AND TALK TO YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU, MAJOR, AND WE THANK ALL OUR VIEWERS.
DEV-MUC3-0361	BOGOTA, 21 AUG 89 -- EDUARDO MARTINEZ ROMERO, THE ALLEGED "COMPTROLLER" OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, WAS CAPTURED BY COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES TODAY DURING THE RAID ON A FARM IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY, IT WAS REPORTED IN BOGOTA.

UNOFFICIAL REPORTS IN BOGOTA INDICATE THAT THE WELL-KNOWN MAFIA MEMBER COULD BE THE FIRST TO BE EXTRADITED TO THE UNITED STATES, IN KEEPING WITH THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT'S NEW PROVISIONS ADOPTED IN VIEW OF THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE. THESE PROVISIONS AUTHORIZE THE EXTRADITION OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO OTHER COUNTRIES WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE JUSTICE TRIBUNALS. ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL REPORTS, MORE THAN 11,000 PEOPLE RELATED TO THE MAFIA HAVE BEEN ARRESTED IN THE INTENSE OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE COLOMBIAN ARMY AND POLICE, IN THE LARGEST OFFENSIVE EVER LAUNCHED BY COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKING BANDS. THE ACTIONS ARE BEING CARRIED OUT ESPECIALLY IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF ANTIOQUIA, CUNDINAMARCA, AND VALLE DEL CAUCA, WHERE SO-CALLED ELITE PATROLS HAVE TAKEN OVER EXTENSIVE AND SWANK PROPERTIES OWNED BY PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA AND GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, THE "DRUG LORDS" OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL. REPORTS TODAY INDICATE THAT ONE OF THE PRIVATE HOMES BELONGING TO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, ALIAS "THE MEXICAN," WAS RAIDED IN BOGOTA.

THE OAS HELD A "SPECIAL AND URGENT" SESSION TODAY AT THE REQUEST OF COLOMBIAN AMBASSADOR LEOPOLDO VILLAR, WHO WANTED TO DIRECTLY INFORM HIS COLLEAGUES IN THAT ORGANIZATION ABOUT THE VIOLENT EVENTS IN HIS COUNTRY.

IN EXPRESSING THEIR SOLIDARITY WITH THE PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA AGAINST WHAT THEY CALLED "THIS TRAGIC SITUATION," THE ARGENTINE DELEGATES STATED THAT THE PROBLEM AFFECTING COLOMBIA "IS A PROBLEM FOR THE WHOLE CONTINENT, BECAUSE, AS IT HAS BEEN CORRECTLY STATED, THE WORLD OF DRUG TRAFFICKING HAS NO BORDERS OR FRONTIERS." THE ARGENTINE DELEGATION ALSO STATED THAT THE SOLIDARITY OF THE OAS MEMBERS MUST BE EXPRESSED THROUGH "A CONDEMNATION OF ALL TYPES OF VIOLENCE AND OF ALL CRIMINAL TERRORISM." IT MUST ALSO BE EXPRESSED THROUGH "THE ACTIONS INTENDED TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY, OF WHICH COLOMBIA IS A CLEAR EXAMPLE, THE ESSENTIAL RIGHTS OF MAN, AND SOCIAL JUSTICE IN THE CONTINENT." THE OAS RESOLUTION ALSO REITERATES THE MEMBER COUNTRIES' CONDEMNATION OF ALL ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE CONSUMPTION, PRODUCTION, AND TRAFFICKING OF DRUGS AND PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES. IT ALSO REAFFIRMS THE COMMITMENT TO STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUGS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE RIO DE JANEIRO PROGRAM FOR INTER-AMERICAN ACTION AND THE GUATEMALA DECLARATION . THE AMBASSADORS TO THE OAS ALSO REAFFIRMED THEIR INTENTION "TO INTENSIFY THE PREPARATION FOR THE MEETING OF MINISTERS FROM ALL MEMBER COUNTRIES, WITH THE GOAL OF REEVALUATING THE CURRENT STATE OF THE DRUG PROBLEM AND ADOPTING CONCRETE MEASURES TO ERADICATE THIS PROBLEM ONCE AND FOR ALL."
DEV-MUC3-0363	GUATEMALA CITY, 21 AUG 89 -- THE STAFF REPORTERS OF THE NEW MAGAZINE POR QUE RESIGNED THEIR POSTS THIS WEEKEND AFTER RECEIVING DEATH THREATS. THE FORMER REPORTERS INDICATED THIS SITUATION COULD MEAN THE MAGAZINE MAY CLOSE THIS WEEK. THE REPORTER INDICATED THAT THE ANONYMOUS THREATS BEGAN ON 18 AUGUST WHEN THEY WERE ORDERED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY IN 72 HOURS. THESE NEWSMEN WERE FORCED TO RESIGN THEIR JOBS, BUT OTHER REPORTERS, WHO ALSO RECEIVED THREATENING TELEPHONE CALLS, DID NOT. THE FORMER REPORTERS INDICATED THAT THIS IS YET ANOTHER ATTACK ON FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AND THOUGHT SINCE 1 AUGUST, WHEN CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT IDEOLOGUE DANILO BARILLAS, WHO WROTE COLUMNS FOR THE MAGAZINE, WAS MURDERED. A FEW DAYS AFTER BARRILLA'S MURDER, ROLANDO PINEDA LAM, POR QUE MAGAZINE PUBLISHER AND SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE CREATION OF THE POPULAR ALLIANCE PARTY-5, FOUNDED BY DANILO BARILLAS UNDER THE NAME FCD-5 , HAD TO GO INTO EXILE. WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE MAGAZINE POR QUE BELONGS TO THE TALENTO EMPRESARIAL COMPANY, IS EDITED BY ASOCIACION LIBRO EXITO, INC, AND APPEARS EVERY TUESDAY. THE EDITORIAL HOUSE DECIDED TO SUSPEND PUBLICATION BECAUSE OF THE DEATH THREATS. SO, IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT THIS NEWS MEDIUM WILL DIE A FEW MONTHS AFTER IT BEGAN. ACTS OF INTIMIDATION AGAINST THE PRODUCTION AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF OF THE AFOREMENTIONED MAGAZINE OCCUR ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH CHARGES BY THE GUATEMALAN CHAMBER OF JOURNALISM THAT THE COUNTRY'S INDEPENDENT PRESS IS BEING HARASSED.
DEV-MUC3-0364	QUITO, 22 AUGUST 89 -- THE ECUADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS REINFORCED ITS BORDER CONTROLS ALONG THE LONG AREA IT SHARES WITH COLOMBIA TO IMPEDE COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS TRYING TO ENTER ECUADOR.

HE DID NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WHOSE OPERATION CENTERS ARE NEAR THE BORDER, COULD TRY TO ENTER ECUADOR TO ESCAPE FROM THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT'S OFFENSIVE AFTER THE MEDELLIN CARTEL'S RECENT MURDERS. VALLEJO, WHO IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE STRONGMAN OF THE ECUADOREAN REGIME, STATED THAT "ECUADOR IS FOREWARNED OF THE DANGER," BUT HE DID NOT, HOWEVER, ANTICIPATE WHAT MEASURES WOULD BE TAKEN BY PRESIDENT RODRIGO BORJA'S ADMINISTRATON TO IMPROVE ITS BORDER CONTROLS. IN THE PAST YEARS, COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE PURCHASED FARMS IN ECUADOR TO ESTABLISH THEIR OPERATION CENTERS, AND IT HAS BEEN NOTICED THAT ECUADORAN PORTS ARE BEING USED INCREASINGLY TO SHIP DRUGS TO THE UNITED STATES AND WESTERN EUROPE. THE MINISTER ADDED "WE ARE FIGHTING DRUG TRAFFICKING VERY STRONGLY."

DEV-MUC3-0367	CARACAS , 23 AUG 89 -- STEPPING UP SURVEILLANCE ALONG THE BORDER WITH COLOMBIA AND PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ' WARNING THAT THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING MUST BE STRENGTHENED ARE VENEZUELA'S VISIBLE REACTIONS TO THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE IN THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRY, WHICH RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF LIBERAL PARTY LEADER LUIS CARLOS GALAN. MEANWHILE, IT WAS LEARNED THAT EDUARDO MARTINEZ ROMERO, RECENTLY ARRESTED IN COLOMBIA AND ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ORGANIZATION'S FINANCES, WAS TRYING TO PURCHASE LAND IN VENEZUELA TO EXPAND THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ORGANIZATION. ACCORDING TO PEREZ, THE ACTIVITIES OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS COULD BE MOVED TO VENEZUELAN TERRITORY. THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT STRESSED THE NEED TO ADOPT STRONG MEASURES AGAINST SUCH A POSSIBILITY. "THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE MUST UNITE IN THIS BATTLE," THE HEAD OF STATE SAID. HE ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT VENEZUELA WILL SUPPORT COLOMBIA BY STEPPING UP SURVEILLANCE ALONG THE BORDER.

THESE TASK FORCES WILL CARRY OUT INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES AND SUPPORT THE MILITARY UNITS STATIONED IN THE AREA. THE MINISTER REJECTED THE POSSIBILITY OF PARAMILITARY PERSONNEL BEING RECRUITED TO FORM THE "TASK FORCES" AND ADDED THAT INCIDENTS LIKE THE ONE THAT OCCURRED IN EL AMPARO ON THE BORDER WITH COLOMBIA LAST YEAR WHEN A GROUP OF SOLDIERS MURDERED 17 FISHERMEN WILL NOT BE REPEATED. "WE ARE TRYING TO KEEP DRUG TRAFFICKERS FROM ENTERING THE COUNTRY TO CONTINUE THEIR CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES, THE MINISTER SAID. ACCORDING TO STATEMENTS MADE BY SOURCES STATIONED ALONG THE COLOMBIAN - VENEZUELAN BORDER, AND CARRIED IN TODAY'S EDITION OF EL NACIONAL, MEDELLIN CARTEL TREASURER MARTINEZ ROMERO WANTED TO BUY LAND IN ZULIA AND TACHIRA, TWO VENEZUELAN STATES, TO EXPAND THE ORGANIZATION'S CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES. ACCORDING TO ZULIA STATE GOVERNOR ISMAEL ORDAZ, THE SECURITY CORPS HAVE BEEN ALERTED IN LIGHT OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKING "CAPOS" MAY HAVE FLED INTO VENEZUELA AS A RESULT OF THE PERSECUTION UNLEASHED IN COLOMBIA FOLLOWING THE MURDER OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN ON 18 AUGUST.
DEV-MUC3-0368	BOGOTA, 23 AUG 89 -- THE GOVERNMENT'S STRUGGLE AGAINST THE DRUG CARTELS CONTINUES. THE OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE AUTHORITIES IN MEDELLIN HAVE RESULTED IN 70 RAIDS. HOUSES, FARMS, DISCOTHEQUES, AND APARTMENTS REPORTEDLY OWNED BY PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA HAVE BEEN SEIZED BY THE AUTHORITIES; 921 PERSONS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED, 2 OF WHOM FACE CHARGES THAT MERIT THEIR EXTRADITION. THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT. HOURS AFTER LEARNING ABOUT THE MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO COUNTER DRUG TRAFFICKERS, REGIONAL AUTHORITIES LAUNCHED A LARGE-SCALE PLAN TO CARRY OUT RAIDS AND CONFISCATIONS, AND TO SET UP ROAD BLOCKS. TWENTY-TWO PROPERTIES -- INCLUDING FARMS, DISCOTHEQUES, BUILDINGS, AND RESTAURANTS -- WERE SEIZED UNDER THE CHARGES THAT THEY WERE OWNED BY MEMBERS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL. THE MOST OUTSTANDING CASES INCLUDE THE MONACO BUILDING -- WHICH WAS ALMOST DESTROYED DURING A DYNAMITE ATTACK LAST YEAR, WAS BEING REPAIRED, AND HAD PRACTICALLY BEEN RESTORED TO ITS FORMER SPLENDOR -- GAMA BUILDING, INTERNATIONAL DISCOTHEQUE, CAMA SUELTA DISCOTHEQUE FORTALEZA DEL LAURO DISCOTHEQUE, AND DON MATEO DISCOTHEQUE, UNDOUBTEDLY THE MOST LUXURIOUS IN THE CITY. SEVERAL FARMS WERE ALSO SEIZED, INCLUDING EL BIZCOCHO FARM, WHERE SEVERAL WEAPONS CACHES WERE FOUND, AND LAS AGUILAS FARM, BECAUSE THE VALUE OF ITS FURNITURE AND APPLIANCES SURPASS 3 BILLION PESOS. THE MAIN CHARACTERISTIC IN ALL THE CONFISCATED PROPERTIES IS THEIR LUXURY AND ECCENTRICISM, THUS MAKING THEIR TOTAL VALUE INCALCULABLE. THE AUTHORITIES ALSO SEIZED WEAPONS, VEHICLES, AND COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT. THE FIRST REPORT INDICATES 921 PERSONS WERE ARRESTED BUT THE FIGURE COULD BE HIGHER, GIVEN THE OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT IN RECENT HOURS. THE ARRESTED PERSONS INCLUDE TWO WHO REPORTEDLY FACE ENOUGH CHARGES TO GUARANTEE THEIR EXTRADITION. MEANWHILE, ANOTHER PERSON HAS BEEN ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH INTERNATIONAL DRUG TRAFFICKING OPERATIONS. SHE IS ANA ELENA BEATRIZ RODRIGUEZ, WHO IS THE THIRD EXTRADITABLE PERSON SOUGHT BY U.S. AUTHORITIES IN CONNECTION WITH MONEY LAUNDERING. SHE WAS CAPTURED IN CARTAGENA. THE COLOMBIAN ARMY'S RAIDS ON PROPERTIES REPORTEDLY OWNED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS STILL CONTINUE. TWO NEW FARMS LOCATED WITHIN THE MOUNTAIN RANGE IN PALMIRA MUNICIPALITY JURISDICTION WERE RECENTLY SEIZED BY THE ARMED FORCES. LA RUIZA FARM, A SYNONYM FOR OSTENTATION AND LUXURY, IS A RECREATION CENTER OWNED, ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES, BY RAMIRO CORREA. PEOPLE VISITING THE FARM COULD ENJOY THE POOLS, SURROUNDED BY LUXURY RUGS, JACUZZIS, A TENNIS COURT, BARS, EXOTICALLY DECORATED BEDROOMS, AND A FOUNTAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LIVING ROOM. THE AUTHORITIES SEIZED A SIZEABLE AMOUNT OF WEAPONS, COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT, BULLET-PROOF VESTS, AMMUNITION FOR RIFLES, GRENADES BROUGHT FROM ISRAEL, MILITARY UNIFORMS, AND INFRA-RED SIGHTS -- WHICH NOT EVEN THE ARMY HAS -- AT EL ROSAL FARM, LOCATED IN THE AREA OF POTRERILLOS. THE AUTHORITIES ALSO SEIZED MOTORCYCLES SMUGGLED INTO THE COUNTRY. MOST OF THE VALLEY WAS VISIBLE FROM A LOOKOUT TOWER, PROBABLY FOR SECURITY REASONS OR FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES. THE MAIN ATTRACTION AT THE FARM WERE TRAINED HIGH- STEPPING COLOMBIAN HORSES. THE OWNERS OF THESE FARMS HAVE YET TO BE ARRESTED, AND THERE IS STILL NO INFORMATION ON THEIR WHEREABOUTS. THE VALUE OF THESE PROPERTIES IS CALCULATED IN MORE THAN 100 BILLION PESOS. THE AUTHORITIES CONTINUE TO DEAL BLOWS TO THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN ATLANTICO DEPARTMENT. BERNARDO LONDONO QUINTERO, A NATIVE OF PEREIRA AND ACCUSED OF BEING A MEMBER OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, WAS CAPTURED EARLY THIS MORNING NORTH OF BARRANQUILLA. THE AUTHORITIES ARE CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING LONDONO'S ACTIVITIES BECAUSE HE IS APPARENTLY SOUGHT BY THE U.S. AUTHORITIES. FURTHERMORE, THE BARRANQUILLA AUTHORITIES HAVE ARRESTED ALBERTO ORLANDES GAMBOA, A 34-YEAR-OLD NATIVE OF BARRANQUILLA WHO IS CONSIDERED ANOTHER EXTRADITABLE PERSON. THE AUTHORITIES CONFISCATED HIS WINE-COLORED TOYOTA LAND CUISER AND A BROWNING 9-MM PISTOL.S EVERAL RAIDS ARE CURRENTLY UNDER WAY IN NORTHERN BARRANQUILLA AT RESIDENCES PRESUMABLY OWNED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

GAVIRIA, WHO BECAME ONE OF THE MAJOR CONTENDERS FOR THE PRESIDENCY OVERNIGHT, SPOKE TODAY. GAVIRIA EXPERIENCED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENTS OF HIS POLITICAL CAREER WHEN HE WAS NOMINATED CANDIDATE OF THE NEW LIBERALISM MOVEMENT. IT IS ALSO PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT TIMES IN HIS PERSONAL LIFE BECAUSE HE RECEIVED THE BANNERS OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN, WHO WAS KILLED LAST FRIDAY. HE SAID THE DEATH OF THE LEADER CANNOT BE USED TO ELIMINATE THE SYSTEM OF CONSULTING WITH THE PEOPLE, WHICH WAS HIS GREATEST POLITICAL ACHIEVEMENT. HE SAID FORMER PRESIDENT JULIO CESAR TURBAY AYALA IS WILLING TO ISSUE SPECIAL A RESOLUTION TO ALLOW THE REGISTRATION OF THE NEW CANDIDACY. IF YOU ALL SUPPORT ME IN THIS EFFORT, IN THE MIDST OF THIS GREAT RESPONSIBILITY, IN THE MIDST OF THE CRISIS IN OUR INSTITUTION THAT IS ENDANGERING OUR DEMOCRACY, I AM SURE JUST AS YOU ARE THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL. I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT THE ELECTIONS, BUT I AM TALKING ABOUT MAKING COLOMBIA SUCCESSFUL. LUIS CARLOS GALAN WILL GUIDE US FROM HEAVEN SO THAT WE CAN MAKE COLOMBIA BETTER. HE SAID THAT EVEN THOUGH HE IS AFRAID HE WILL STILL GO OUT TO PUBLIC PLACES TO FIGHT TERRORISM. HE SAID HE IS WILLING TO RESPECT THE RULES OF THE GAME OF THE NEW LIBERALISM. GAVIRIA WILL NOW HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO APPOINT MEMBERS OF HIS CAMPAIGN. EVEN THOUGH IT WAS NOT EASY FOR SOME OF GALAN'S FRIENDS TO ACCEPT THE NEW LEADER OF THEIR MOVEMENT, THEY KNOW THAT GALAN IS NO LONGER HERE, AND GAVIRIA IS THE NEW LEADER.

WE HAVE BEEN ASKING THE GOVERNMENT FOR PEACE SINCE THE TALKS IN PANAMA IN 1984. A LOT OF VIOLENCE COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. 2. WE ACCEPTED THE PEACE PLAN PROPOSED BY PRESIDENT BARCO BUT WE RECEIVED NO REPLY FROM THE GOVERNMENT. 3. THE ONLY REPLY WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN REPRESSION, ARBITRARY UNJUST ARREST OF OUR RELATIVES, LOOTING OF OUR HOUSES. 4. ALL KINDS OF JURIDICAL VIOLATIONS HAVE BEEN PERPETRATED AGAINST US. 5. THE GOVERNMENT HAS BRIBED JUSTICE WITH , DIPLOMATIC SINECURES, AND TRIPS ABROAD. 6. THE ACTIONS OF CONFISCATION ARE NOTHING NEW; THEY HAVE ALWAYS PREVAILED IN OUR COUNTRY. WERE UNJUSTLY ARRESTED AND IMPRISONED, EVEN THOUGH NO ARREST WARRANTS HAD BEEN ISSUED AGAINST THEM, AND MANY OF OUR PROPERTIES AND POSSESSIONS WERE ARBITRARILY CONFISCATED OR USURPED. 7. COLOMBIAN CITIZENS CHARGED WITH MONEY LAUNDERING HAVE BEEN EXTRADITED AND WILL BE EXTRADITED, ALTHOUGH THIS REPRESENTS A VIOLATION OF COLOMBIAN LAWS. 8. WE ALWAYS WERE, ARE, AND WILL BE WILLING TO ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE BUT WE WILL NOT LOWER OUR GUARD AND WE WILL CONTINUE OUR STRUGGLE AND WIDESPREAD WAR AGAINST TRAITORS AND TURNCOATS. 9. WE DECLARE A WIDESPREAD AND TOTAL WAR ON THE GOVERNMENT, THE INDUSTRIAL AND POLITICAL OLIGARCHY, THE JOURNALISTS WHO HAVE ATTACKED AND MISTREATED US, JUDGES WHO HAVE BEEN BRIBED BY THE GOVERNMENT, THE EXTRADITING MAGISTRATES, THE BUSINESS ORGANIZATION PRESIDENTS, AND ALL THOSE WHO HAVE PERSECUTED US IN THE PAST. 10. WE WILL NOT RESPECT THE FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO HAVE NOT RESPECTED OUR FAMILIES. WE WILL KILL THEM, AND WE WILL BURN AND DESTROY THE OLIGARCHY'S INDUSTRIES, PROPERTIES, AND MANSIONS. THE EXTRADITABLES.
DEV-MUC3-0372	BOGOTA, 24 AUG 89 -- POLICE IN THIS CAPITAL TODAY REPORTED THAT FOUR BOMBS EXPLODED IN THE CITY OF MEDELLIN EARLY THIS MORNING, KILLING ONE MAN AND CAUSING DAMAGE ESTIMATED IN THE MILLIONS TO TWO POLITICAL PARTY OFFICES AND TO THE COUNTRY HOMES OF TWO POLITICAL LEADERS OF ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, 500 KM NORTHWEST OF BOGOTA.

THE POLICE SAID THAT THE COUNTRY HOMES OF LEADER IGNACIO VELEZ ESCOBAR AND FORMER CABINET MINISTER EDGAR GUTIERREZ CASTRO IN SABANETA AND EL RETIRO MUNICIPALITIES, RESPECTIVELY, ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, WERE SIMILARLY ATTACKED BY THE TERRORISTS. IN ITS INITIAL REPORT THE POLICE ADMITTED THAT THE WAVE OF BOMBINGS COULD BE LINKED TO THE GOVERNMENT'S WEEK-LONG NATIONWIDE OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKING MAFIA.
DEV-MUC3-0373	GUATEMALA CITY, 24 AUG 89 -- WELL-KNOWN BANKER RAMIRO CASTILLO LOVE WAS MURDERED TODAY BY A GROUP OF UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS WHO RIDDLED HIM WITH MACHINEGUN FIRE AS HE WAS LEAVING HIS RESIDENCE IN AN ELEGANT SUBURB IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THIS CITY. ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, APPROXIMATELY SIX UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS BEARING ARMS WENT TO HIS RESIDENCE THIS MORNING WITH THE INTENTION OF ROBBING OR KIDNAPPING CASTILLO. CASTILLO RESISTED, HOWEVER, AND WAS SHOT TO DEATH. THE ATTACKERS ALSO WOUNDED CASTILLO'S SON. AFTER MURDERING CASTILLO THE ATTACKERS JUMPED INTO ONE OF CASTILLO'S VEHICLES AND FLED. CASTILLO WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE BANCO INDUSTRIAL, THE LARGEST PRIVATE BANK IN GUATEMALA. IT WAS ALSO REPORTED TODAY THAT UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS KIDNAPPED A YOUNG COUPLE, SILVIA AZURDIA AND VICTOR RODRIGUEZ, AS THEY WERE LEAVING THEIR HOME IN GUATEMALA CITY. BOTH AZURDIA AND RODRIGUEZ ARE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. AZURDIA IS THE DAUGHTER OF FREDDY AZURDIA, THE DIRECTOR OF A LOCAL RADIO NEWS PROGRAM CALLED "COMANDO INFORMATIVO."
DEV-MUC3-0374	BOGOTA, 24 AUG 89 -- AS A RESULT OF COLOMBIAN PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LUIS CARLOS GALAN'S MURDER, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES' SECURITY IN PUBLIC APPEARANCES HAS BECOME A MAJOR ISSUE. FOLLOWING ARE THE MINIMUM SECURITY MEASURES THAT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND SAVE THEIR LIVES WHEN ENDANGERED. FROM NOW ON SUPPORTERS OF ANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO ABIDE BY THE FOLLOWING SECURITY MEASURES DURING THEIR CANDIDATES' PUBLIC APPEARANCES. MEASURES FOR CANDIDATES 1. ALL CANDIDATES WILL HAVE TO PLACE THEMSELVES IN THE HANDS OF THEIR GUARDIAN ANGELS, IN OTHER WORDS TO THEIR CHIEF ESCORT. THE CHIEF ESCORT AND THE CANDIDATE WILL JOINTLY PLAN EACH TOUR AND WILL PROGRAM ALL MOVEMENTS IN DETAIL AND FOLLOW THE PROGRAM TO THE LETTER. THE CANDIDATE MUST INFORM THE CHIEF ESCORT OF HIS AGENDA AND OF ANY THREAT OR INDICATION OF DANGER HE RECEIVES. THE CANDIDATE MUST USE HIS ESCORTS EXCLUSIVELY FOR HIS PROTECTION AND FOR NO OTHER USE. 2. A CANDIDATE'S ESCORTS MUST KNOW THE CANDIDATE'S BLOODTYPE, HIS ILLNESSES, AND WHICH MEDICINE HE TAKES. THE ESCORTS MUST ALSO KNOW THE NAMES OF THE CANDIDATE'S CLOSEST FRIENDS. 3. THE CANDIDATE MUST LEARN WHAT TO DO IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION. HIS ESCORTS WILL TEACH HIM WHAT TO DO. 4. NO ONE SHOULD BE SURPRISED IF THE CANDIDATES CHANGE THEIR PLANS AT THE LAST MINUTE. THE CANDIDATE MUST NOT FALL INTO A ROUTINE. HE MUST CHANGE ROUTES, SCHEDULES, AND PROGRAMS ALWAYS IN CONSULTATION WITH HIS CHIEF ESCORT. 5. THE CANDIDATE MUST ALWAYS HAVE A DOCTOR IN HIS GROUP. 6. EACH CANDIDATE WILL HAVE TO BEAR AN EXTRA BURDEN. HE WILL HAVE TO WEAR A HEAVY AND SUFFOCATING BULLET-PROOF VEST. SUPPORTERS, PLEASE TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT. 7. A PUBLIC RALLY IN AN OPEN PLACE AT NIGHT CAN BE DEADLY FOR YOUR CANDIDATE. PLEASE EXCLUDE ANY SUCH RALLIES FROM YOUR PLANS. 8. SAY NO TO THE USE OF FIRECRACKERS AND POWDER KEGS DURING DEMONSTRATIONS. SUCH THINGS CONFUSE ESCORTS AND SECURITY CORPS. 9. SUPPORTERS, PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT CROWDS WHO WANT TO SHAKE CANDIDATES' HANDS OR TOUCH THEM CAN BE DEADLY. ESCORTS SHOULD NOT ALLOW SUCH THINGS. 10. CANDIDATES WILL HAVE TO LIMIT THEIR WALKS IN PUBLIC PLACES AND REDUCE THEIR SOCIAL ACTIVITIES TO THE MINIMUM. CANDIDATES WILL VISIT THEIR FRIENDS AT UNUSUAL HOURS. THIS IS HOW SECURITY WILL BE HANDLED FROM NOW ON. ALL THESE MEASURES HAVE TURNED CANDIDATES INTO MEN WITH LIMITATIONS. THEIR SUPPORTERS MUST UNDERSTAND THEIR CANDIDATES' SITUATION. CANDIDATES ARE MEN UNDER THE DICTATORSHIP OF THEIR GUARDIAN ANGELS WHO LOOK AFTER THEIR SAFETY IN TIMES OF RAGE.
DEV-MUC3-0375	NO CITY , 25 AUG 89 -- YOU MUST KNOW BETTER THAN I THAT THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT ITSELF, AND NOT ONLY INDIVIDUAL ISRAELI NATIONALS, ARE ACCUSED OF MAKING SECURITY-RELATED DEALS WITH VARIOUS REGIMES WHICH -- TO THE CIVILIZED WESTERN WORLD, AT LEAST -- APPEAR TO BE OF QUESTIONABLE REPUTE. WHAT ARE THE CRITERIA THAT GUIDE ISRAEL'S ACTIONS AS A STATE AND WHEN ISSUING PERMITS TO PRIVATE COMPANIES TO MAKE DEALS WITH SUCH COUNTRIES? I WILL NOT GO INTO THE DETAILS OF THE VARIOUS CRITERIA DETERMINED BY THE DEFENSE MINISTRY, WHICH ARE OFTEN RELATED TO OUR OWN DEFENSE ISSUES. ONE CRITERION, HOWEVER, IS CLEAR: WE DO NOT ALLOW COOPERATION WITH ELEMENTS WHICH ARE NOT STATE-AFFILIATED, SUCH AS CARTELS, GROUPS, OR GANGS. ALL THESE ARE OFF LIMITS. THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT, AND NO GREY AREAS. THEREFORE, IF THE REPORTS FROM COLOMBIA ARE TRUE, THE PEOPLE ACTED COUNTER TO OUR POLICY AND IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW. WHAT ABOUT WORKING WITH OPPOSITION MOVEMENTS TO CERTAIN REGIMES? I REPEAT: STATE MOVEMENTS ONLY, OR, LET US SAY, STATE REGIMES. THIS IS OUR POLICY. ANY OTHER ACTION RUNS COUNTER TO OUR POLICY. WHEN ISRAELI INVOLVEMENT IN DRUG TRAFFICKING IN COLOMBIA IS MENTIONED, DO YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF ISRAELIS REFERRED TO? PERHAPS THE STATEMENT IS EXAGGERATED, AND THERE ARE NO MORE THAN ONE OR TWO, PERHAPS THREE ISRAELIS? THAT IS A GOOD POINT; REPORTS ARE SO OFTEN BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION. WE SEEM TO HAVE SOME KIND OF REPUTATION WHICH OFTEN LEADS TO EXAGGERATED AND FANTASTIC -- I DO NOT WISH TO USE THE TERM ROMANTIC -- REPORTS IN THIS CONTEXT. IN ANY EVENT, THERE ARE MANY REPORTS, AND WE WOULD LIKE TO GET TO THE CORE OF TRUTH BEHIND THEM. AFTER THAT, WE WILL DECIDE WHAT ACTION WE CAN TAKE. WE MAY TAKE LEGAL STEPS, TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S PASSPORTS, AND RESORT TO OTHER METHODS. IN THE PAST, MR NETANYAHU, YOU BELONGED TO AN ARMY UNIT IN WHICH OUR FINEST YOUNG PEOPLE SERVED. HAVE YOU FOUND FORMER ARMY FRIENDS IN ANY OF THE MENTIONED NAMES? NO, AND I HOPE NEVER TO FIND ANY. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE PHENOMENON? IF IT EXISTS! YES, IF IT EXISTS. OUR ENTIRE CONVERSATION IS SUBJECT TO THIS PROVISO, BECAUSE WE HAVE NO SOLID GROUNDS FOR DISCUSSION. IF IT EXISTS, I THINK IT REFLECTS THE MORAL CORRUPTION OF A FEW INDIVIDUALS. THE STATE CANNOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT EACH OF ITS NATIONALS DOES OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY. THESE PEOPLE MAY HAVE SUCCUMBED TO MERCENARY OR OTHER TEMPTATIONS. THE EXPRESSION OF SELLING ONE'S SOUL TO THE DEVIL IS APPROPRIATE IN THEIR CASE. DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER BINYAMIN NETANYAHU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU.
DEV-MUC3-0376	BOGOTA, 25 AUG 89 -- THE SINISTER EXTRADITABLES GROUP TODAY THREATENED TO KILL 10 JUDGES FOR EVERY COLOMBIAN WHO IS EXTRADITED TO THE UNITED STATES. THIS IS A WARNING TO THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO WHO HAS ANNOUNCED THAT INDIVIDUALS LINKED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING CAN BE EXTRADITED. THE CLANDESTINE GROUP, WHICH EARLY THIS MORNING SET FIRE TO THE LLANO GRANDE COUNTRY CLUB IN RIONEGRO MUNICIPALITY, 40 KM NORTH OF MEDELLIN, SENT A LETTER TODAY TO OMAR GARCES, FIRST SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE OF CALI, INFORMING HIM OF THE THREAT TO KILL 10 JUDGES FOR EVERY PERSON EXTRADITED. GARCES, WHO IS ALSO PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF JUDICIAL OFFICIALS IN VALLE DEL CAUCA DEPARTMENT, SAID THAT THE EXTRADITABLES SENT SEVERAL MESSAGES WITH THE THREAT TO VARIOUS JUDICIAL OFFICES IN THAT AREA OF THE COUNTRY, LOCATED 500 KM FROM BOGOTA. AS A RESULT OF THE EXTRADITABLES' THREAT, THE JUDGES ARE HOLDING A MEETING TO WEIGH THE SITUATION AND DETERMINE THE VERACITY OF THE WARNING. HOWEVER, THEY DECIDED THEY WILL NOT STOP WORKING. "THE TIME HAS COME TO UNITE AROUND THE COUNTRY'S FLAG TO RECOVER COLOMBIA'S DIGNITY AND TO PREVENT ITS BAD SONS FROM CONTINUING TO SHAME IT BEFORE THE WORLD," JUDGE GARCES SAID. HE ALSO ASKED FOR PROTECTION FOR HIMSELF AND THE OTHER JUDGES IN THAT AREA OF THE COUNTRY.
DEV-MUC3-0377	SANTIAGO, 25 AUG 89 -- LA SERENA INVESTIGATIVE POLICE HAVE DEALT A HARD BLOW TO DRUG TRAFFICKING BY ARRESTING FOUR PERUVIAN CITIZENS WHO ENTERED CHILE ACROSS THE NORTHERN BORDER WITH 2 KG OF COCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE VALUED AT $160,000. THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE IDENTIFIED AS ROSA DEL CARMEN ZABALA, 35, RESIDING IN MIRAFLORES NEIGHBORHOOD IN LIMA, PERU; ROSENDA LUCRECIA RIBANE, 34, ALSO RESIDING IN MIRAFLORES, LIMA; CHAUFFER OSCAR AUGUSTO PORTOCARRERO, 25, RESIDING IN PUNTA NEGRA, LIMA; AND RUBEN URIEL GARCIA, 36, RESIDING IN LIMA, PERU. THOSE PEOPLE WERE PLACED AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE LA SERENA JUDGE ON DUTY, AND THE COCAINE WAS INCINARATED AT THE LA SERENA REGIONAL HOSPITAL. THE FOUR TRAFFICKERS CARRIED THE COCAINE IN SEALED PACKAGES READY FOR SALE IN LA SERENA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. THE PACKAGES WERE HELD IN ELASTIC CORSETS UNDER THEIR CLOTHS. THE CORSETS HAD BEEN IMPREGNATED WITH PEPPER TO DISGUISE THE COCAINE'S CHARACTERISTIC SMELL.
DEV-MUC3-0378	SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE -- WHEN MUCH TERRORIST VIOLENCE IS CREATED AND WHEN MUCH STREET VIOLENCE IS CREATED, EVERYONE IS ADVERSELY AFFECTED; WE BELIEVE THE ARMED FORCES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING. WE BELIEVE THAT WHEN IT PREVENTS VIOLENCE, IT IS DOING A MORE PROFESSIONAL JOB THAN IF IT ALLOWED IT TO TAKE PLACE, BECAUSE ONCE THE VIOLENCE GETS STARTED, THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS MAY BE A LOT MORE UNFORTUNATE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE POLICY OF TRYING TO PREVENT VIOLENT PLANS BEFORE THEY ARE CARRIED OUT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS PRODUCED GOOD RESULTS. OF COURSE, THE PEOPLE SUSPECTED BY THE ARMED FORCES OF SUPPORTING THE FMLN PLANS ARE ARRESTED AND TURNED OVER TO THE JUDGE ONCE THE EVIDENCE IS GATHERED. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT. UNFORTUNATELY MANY OF THOSE WHO ARE ARRESTED ARE LATER RELEASED. MANY OF THEM TURN OUT TO BE INNOCENT BECAUSE SUSPICIONS MAY TURN OUT TO BE FALSE AND THE JUDGE IS THERE TO PREVENT MISTAKES FROM BEING COMMITTED. HOWEVER, THE ARMED FORCES ARE ACTING WITHIN A LEGAL FRAMEWORK. THERE ARE CASES SUCH AS MR MASARIEGO. WHEN HE WAS RELEASED, IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH HIM, AND WE HAVE HERE DOCUMENTS PROVING THAT. HOWEVER, HE TOURED THE UNITED STATES TO SHOW OFF HIS BURNT KNEE AND TO SAY THAT HE HAD BEEN TORTURED HERE IN EL SALVADOR. IT HAD BEEN PROVEN THAT THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS RELEASED. THE LEFT WANTS TO DISCREDIT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES ABROAD. HOWEVER, I DO NO BELIEVE THE LEFT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL. MR PRESIDENT, AN ANALYST WHO MET WITH US A SHORT TIME AGO GAVE HIS OPINION ON THE POSSIBILITY OF A DIALOGUE AND ITS RESULTS. HE WAS NOT VERY OPTIMISTIC AND HE SAID THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL POINTS THAT COULD BECOME OBSTACLES TO THE DIALOGUE. ONE OF THEM WAS THE ECONOMIC MEASURES. HE SAID THAT THE FMLN COULD NOT HOLD NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT AS LONG AS THE GOVERNMENT MAINTAINED THE ECONOMIC MEASURES IT WAS IMPLEMENTING. WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THE FMLN COMMUNIQUES, WHICH ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO KEEP IMPLEMENTING THE AGRARIAN REFORM PROCESS AND OTHER SERIES OF POINTS CONCERNING THE ECONOMIC MEASURES. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU, WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK, WHAT CAN THE GOVERNMENT NEGOTIATE OR WHAT DOES THE GOVERNMENT UNDERSTAND BY NEGOTIATION? COULD THERE BE POSSIBLE NEGOTIATION ON THE ECONOMIC POLICY? I BELIEVE THE WORD NEGOTIATION HERE IN OUR COUNTRY NO LONGER HAS THAT GENERIC MEANING GIVEN BY THE DICTIONARY. THIS WORD HAS BEEN MANIPULATED BY LEFTIST FORCES IN THE SENSE THAT TO NEGOTIATE IS TO ACCEPT WHAT THE FMLN WANTS. ACCORDING TO THE LEFT, THAT IS WHAT NEGOTIATING MEANS. I BELIEVE THE WORD NEGOTIATION HAS A GENERIC MEANING. A NEGOTIATION IS TO TRY TO FIND JOINT AGREEMENTS TO SOLVE A PROBLEM AND THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN PROPOSING. WE HAVE SOUGHT AGREEMENTS ON THE LARGEST NUMBER OF POINTS POSSIBLE. LOGICALLY, NOT ALL POINTS WILL BE ACCEPTED BY THE OTHER SIDE AND WE BELIEVE THE FMLN IS MAKING A MISTAKE WHEN IT THINKS IT WILL NEGOTIATE ITS ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, OR SOCIAL PLATFORM WITH THE GOVERNMENT. THE FMLN MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE TO NEGOTIATE THEIR PLANS FOR THE COUNTRY WITH THE PEOPLE. THAT IS DONE BY POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS AND BY SHOWING THEIR PROPOSALS TO THE PUBLIC. IF THE PEOPLE ARE CONVINCED THAT THEIR PROPOSALS ARE BEST, THEY WILL GET THE VOTES AND THEY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO IMPLEMENT THEIR PROGRAMS AND THEIR POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL PROGRAMS. IN THIS CASE, UNFORTUNATELY THEY DID NOT PARTICIPATE; IT WAS OUR PARTY PLATFORM THAT WAS CHOSEN BY THE PEOPLE. THIS GIVES THE GOVERNMENT THE RIGHT TO IMPLEMENT WHAT THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE ASK OF THEM. WE DO NOT THINK THE FMLN SHOULD OPPOSE THIS OFFERING. THE FMLN REFUSES TO TALK WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND KEEPS LOOKING FOR EXCUSES AND SETTING CONDITIONS, SUCH AS DEMANDING THAT THE GOVERNMENT DECLARE ITSELF TEMPORARY BEFORE ANY TALKS ARE CONSIDERED. THEY KNOW THEY ARE ASKING THE IMPOSSIBLE. THEIR TRUE PURPOSE IS TO REFUSE TO TALK SERIOUSLY, WHICH THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WANTS THEM TO DO. LORENA, I DO NOT THINK WE SHOULD CONFUSE THE VARIOUS FACTORS INVOLVED. HOLDING A DIALOGUE IS NOT EASY, AS POINTED OUT BY THIS ANALYST, WHOSE NAME I DO NOT KNOW. THE SITUATION IS NOT EASY TO RESOLVE. THIS PROCESS COULD WELL LAST MANY MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS. IT IS NECESSRY TO START NOW WITH A DIALOGUE IN WHICH BOTH SIDES BEGIN TO DISCUSS, NOT WHAT THEY CANNOT AGREE ON, BUT WHAT WE CAN AGREE ON. WE SHOULD BEGIN BY TRYING TO ELIMINATE THE VIOLENCE THAT PREVAILS IN THE COUNTRY. IF THEY FIND THEY CANNOT AGREE ON SOME OF THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSALS, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER AN ALTERNATIVE STANCE. THE FMLN KEEPS SAYING THAT THERE ARE NO PROPER CONDITIONS FOR TALKING.
DEV-MUC3-0379	BOGOTA, 25 AUG 89 -- LAST MINUTE REPORT: IN CONFUSING EVENTS, POLICE LIEUTENANT ALFREDO CORREA AND ONE PRIVATE WERE KILLED IN VALLE DEPARTMENT. NO FURTHER INFORMATION ON THIS INCIDENT HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE, OTHER THAN THAT AUTHORITIES ARE INVESTIGATING THE EVENT. IT HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED THAT 10TH ARMY BRIGADE MEMBERS FOUND AND CONFISCATED 2 METRIC TONS OF HIGH-GRADE COCAINE AT LA MONEDA FARM IN LECHI, CAUCASIA, AT THE BORDER BETWEEN ANTIOQUIA AND CORDOBA DEPARTMENTS. THE DRUG WAS FOUND IN SEALED WATERPROOF PACKAGES IN UNDERGROUND TUNNELS. THIS MAKES AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THE DRUG WAS READY TO BE AIR DROPPED OVER THE SEA TO BE PICKED UP BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS. IN ADDITION, A LARGE NUMBER OF ARMS, A SIZABLE AMOUNT OF AMMUNITION, AS WELL AS AUTOMOBILES AND RADIO SETS WERE CONFISCATED. THE DRUG WAS SET ON FIRE IN THE PRESENCE OF JUDGES AND MILITARY AUTHORITIES. A CLANDESTINE LANDING STRIP WAS ALSO DESTROYED. ARSON SEEMS TO BE THE NEW CRIMINAL STYLE USED IN ANTIOQUIA. IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS, FOUR FARMS HAVE BEEN SET ON FIRE. THREE OF THESE FARMS, LOCATED NEAR MEDELLIN, ARE OWNED BY POLITICAL AND INDUSTRIAL LEADERS EDGAR GUTIERREZ CASTRO, IGNACIO VELEZ ESCOBAR, AND AUGUSTO LOPEZ. THE MOST RECENT OF THESE INCIDENTS OCCURRED AT THE LLANO GRANDE COUNTRY CLUB EARLY THIS MORNING. SEVERAL ARMED MEN SHOWED UP AT THE SITE AND SET THE CLUB ON FIRE AFTER THREATENING AND BEATING UP THE WATCHMEN. THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSSES HAS NOT YET BEEN DETERMINED. THE MANAGER DID NOT ALLOW REPORTERS INTO THE PLACE. IT WAS REPORTED, HOWEVER, THAT THE ATTACKERS IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS EXTRADITABLES WHO SAID THE ACTION WAS BEING TAKEN IN REPRISAL FOR THE GOVERNMENT ACTIONS AGAINST THEM. THE ARMED MEN LEFT THE PLACE SHOUTING THAT THEIR REACTION HAS JUST BEGUN AND THAT THEIR STRUGGLE WILL CONTINUE. FURTHER DAMAGE TO THE CLUB AND THE LOSS OF HUMAN LIFE WERE PREVENTED BY WORKERS WHO REACTED PROMPTLY. THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN MEASURES TO COUNTERACT THESE ACTIONS. THE ARMY THIS AFTERNOON WILL RECEIVE THE INITIAL U.S. TACTICAL SUPPORT AS PART OF THE NEW ANTITERRORIST OFFENSIVE, GOVERNMENT SOURCES HAVE REPORTED. U.S. MILITARY CARGO PLANES WILL FLY TO COLOMBIA ARMED TWIN-TURBINE BELL-212 HELICOPTERS. IN ADDITION, THE PENTAGON WILL SHIP RADIO COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT. THE HELICOPTERS WILL BE FLOWN BY COLOMBIAN MILITARY CREWS, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SOURCES SAID IN WASHINGTON. FOR THE TIME BEING, BOTH GEORGE BUSH'S ADMINISTRATION AND VIRGILIO BARCO'S GOVERNMENT ARE NOT CONSIDERING THE PRESENCE OF U.S. MILITARY MEN IN COLOMBIA. OVER THE PAST 72 HOURS, THE ARMY RAIDED FIVE FARMS, ONE HOME, AND A BAR-RESTAURANT OWNED BY GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, CAMILO ZAPATA, AND PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA. THE RAIDS WERE CONDUCTED BY 13TH BRIGADE TROOPS IN CHIA, PACHO, AND BOGOTA. THIS FARM, KNOWN AS EL CASTILLO DE MARROQUIN, OWNED BY ZAPATA AND ESTIMATED TO BE WORTH MORE THAN 100 BILLION PESOS, WAS RAIDED ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. ACCORDING TO THE ARMY, THIS VERITABLE FORTRESS, LOCATED ON THE EL COMUN BRIDGE, WAS MANAGED BY RETIRED POLICE MAJOR ALVARO TOVAR TOVAR. LUXURIOUS CARS, A GOLD-ORNAMENTED CHAPEL, A SWIMMING POOL FITTED WITH A HEATING SYSTEM, 15 STABLES WITH FINE HORSES, A TENNIS COURT, AND THE IMPRESSIVE CASTLE ALL MAKE UP A FARM WORTH MILLIONS. EXTENSIVE GARDENS, LONG TRAILS, AND AN ATTRACTIVE LAKE COMPLEMENT THE WONDERFUL NATURAL LANDSCAPE OF THE REAL ESTATE RIGHT BY THE BOGOTA NORTHERN FREEWAY. THERE ARE EXOTIC ADORNMENTS ON THE WALLS. FOR INSTANCE, THERE IS A BOTERO PAINTING WORTH 4 MILLION PESOS. IN ONE ROOM, THERE WERE MANY ELECTRIC APPLIANCES AND A FULL RADIO COMMUNICATIONS SET. THE EXORBITANT WEALTH IS INDICATED BY EVEN A WITCHCRAFT ROOM.
DEV-MUC3-0380	SAN SALVADOR, 25 AUG 89 -- MILITARY AND REBEL SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT CLASHES BETWEEN SOLDIERS AND GUERRILLAS IN THE PAST FEW HOURS HAVE RESULTED IN 27 CASUALTIES. THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE REPORTED THAT NINE GUERRILLAS WERE KILLED IN A CONFRONTATION WITH ARMY TROOPS IN A VILLAGE NEAR METAPAN, SANTA ANA DEPARTMENT, IN THE COUNTRY'S WEST. RADIO VENCEREMOS, OFFICIAL VOICE OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT , REPORTED THAT THE REBELS INFLICTED 18 CASUALTIES, ON THE ARMY IN THREE AMBUSHES. ACCORDING TO THE CLANDESTINE RADIO STATION, THE AMBUSHES TOOK PLACE ON THE SAN SALVADOR - SANTA ANA HIGHWAY, CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT, AND IN LOS MASARIEGOS, NEAR SAN JOSE GUAYABAL. THE ARMY REPORTED THAT IN THE PAST FEW HOURS THE FMLN CONTINUED ITS SABOTAGING ACTIONS AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC STRUCTURE WITH EXPLOSIVE CHARGES ON POSTS OF THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM AND TELEPHONE JUNCTION BOXES. IN ADDITION, THE ARMY ADMITTED THAT A UH-1H HELICOPTER WAS DAMAGED BY GUERRILLAS AT CINQUERA, CABANAS DEPARTMENT, BUT THAT NO CASUALTIES RESULTED. ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY REPORT, THE AIRCRAFT WAS HIT BY FIRE WHILE SUPPLYING TROOPS OF MILITARY DETACHMENT 2 IN THE NORTH OF CABANAS DEPARTMENT.
DEV-MUC3-0381	CLANDESTINE, 25 AUG 89 -- SALVADORAN PEOPLE, THIS IS RADIO FARABUNDO MARTI REPORTING A NEW HONDURAN ARMY RAID INTO SALVADORAN TERRITORY.

AT 1400 ON 24 AUGUST, A HONDURAN ARMY PATROL ENTERED 3 KM INSIDE SALVADORAN TERRITORY AT EL MONO HAMLET IN NAHUATERIQUE JURISDICTION, MORAZAN DEPARTMENT. A FEW DAYS AGO, OTHER SALVADORAN ARMY PATROLS ENTERED LAS ARADAS HAMLET IN NAHUATERIQUE. WE REMIND YOU THAT IN THE PAST FEW DAYS WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING THESE RAIDS BY HONDURAN TROOPS IN LAS FILAS BORDER AREA IN WESTERN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT. THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN RAIDS IN ARCATAO, WHERE HONDURAN TROOPS HAVE RANSACKED SCHOOLS, THREATENED TEACHERS, REPRESSED AREA RESIDENTS, SET FIRES, STOLE VILLAGERS' PROPERTY, AND KIDNAPPED SOME CITIZENS. WE REPEAT OUR WARNING TO THE HONDURAN TROOPS, ESPECIALLY TO THE HONDURAN ARMY HIGH COMMAND AND GOVERNMENT. WE WILL NOT PERMIT MORE RAIDS AND OUTRAGES AGAINST CIVILIANS IN OUR TERRITORY. OUR UNITS WILL ATTACK THE HONDURAN TROOPS. AZCONA HOYO, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. WE URGE THE HONDURAN PEOPLE TO TAKE ACTION AND DEMAND RESPECT FOR SALVADORAN SOVEREIGNTY BECAUSE THIS MEDDLING BY THE HONDURAN ARMY AND IN OUR CONFLICT IS OUR CONCERN . HONDURAN TROOPS, IN COMPLICITY WITH THE SALVADORAN ARMY, CARRY OUT ALL SORTS OF OUTRAGES.
DEV-MUC3-0382	BONN , 24 AUG 89 -- FEDERAL CHANCELLOR HELMUT KOHL HAS PROMISED THE PEOPLE OF COLOMBIA THE COMPREHENSIVE SOLIDARITY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE DRUGS TRADE AND TERRORISM. KOHL WROTE THIS TO COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS IN A TELEGRAM, PUBLISHED IN BONN TODAY.

THE SCOURGE OF DRUGS CONSTITUTES A CHALLENGE TO THE WHOLE COMMUNITY OF NATIONS. THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC ATTRIBUTES THE GREATEST POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE TO FIGHTING THIS EVIL AT NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, KOHL WROTE.
DEV-MUC3-0383	SANTIAGO, 24 AUG 89 -- THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER, CNI, REPORTED THIS AFTERNOON THAT ROBERTO NORDENFLYGHT FARIAS, WHO KILLED ARMY LIEUTENANT ROBERTO ZEGERS REED IN AN ARMED CLASH IN SANTIAGO LAST SUNDAY, WAS AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT AND THE STEPSON OF COMMUNIST LEADER VOLODIA TEITELBOIM. IN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE, THE CNI PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICE SAYS THAT A REVIEW OF THE DOCUMENTS SEIZED FROM NORDENFLYGHT'S HOME MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR THE CNI TO CONCLUDE THAT HE WAS THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE FPMR, THE ARMED BRANCH OF THE CHILEAN COMMUNIST PARTY NORDENFLYGHT, WHO WAS KILLED BY A SENTRY IN THE ARMED CLASH AT THE TOBALABA AIR FIELD AFTER KILLING LT ZEGERS, ASSUMED THE LEADERSHIP POSITION WITHIN THE EXTREMIST ORGANIZATION IN SEPTEMBER 1988, THE CNI SAID. IN THIS CAPACITY, NORDEFLYGHT SUPERVISED A 21 OCTOBER ATTACK ON A POLICE DETACHMENT AND RESIDENTS OF THE MOUNTAIN TOWNSHIP OF LOS QUENES, IN THE SEVENTH REGION. THE CNI ADDS THAT NORDENFLYGHT WAS THE SON OF ELIANA DEL CARMEN FARIAS ASSIF, WHO HAS BEEN MARRIED TO PCCH GENERAL SECRETARY VOLODIA TEITELBOIM SINCE JANUARY 1986. THIS WAS PART OF A COMMUNIQUE RELEASED BY THE CNI, THE GOVERNMENT'S SECURITY ORGANIZATION.
DEV-MUC3-0384	BRIDGETOWN , 24 AUG 89 -- WASHINGTON, D.C.--THE BAHAMAS GOVERNMENT IS SUPPORTING COLOMBIA'S FIGHT ON ILLEGAL DRUG TRAFFICKING. "THERE ARE LESSONS TO BE LEARNED FROM THE RECENT EVENTS IN COLOMBIA. WE APPLAUD THE COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT FOR THE BOLD STEPS HE IS TAKING, BUT WE MUST SHOW THE CARTELS THAT HE IS NOT ALONE," BAHAMAS' FOREIGN MINISTER CHARLES CARTER SAID. THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS STEPPED UP THE FIGHT AGAINST THE TRAFFICKERS FOLLOWING THE KILLING OF A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. CARTER SAID THAT "ALL OF US IN THIS HEMISPHERE" MUST SHOW THE DRUG DEALERS THEY ARE "PART OF THE WAR". THE BAHAMAS WANTS TO HOST A MEETING THIS YEAR OF LEADERS OF THE HEMISPHERE TO DEFINE A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR WAGING AN ALL OUT WAR ON THE PRODUCTION, PROCESSING, SHIPMENT, DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF ILLEGAL DRUGS. CARTER TOLD CANA THAT RECENT EVENTS IN COLOMBIA DEMONSTRATED THE NEED FOR A WELL PLANNED, COORDINATED AND IMPLEMENTED PROGRAM WHICH WOULD TACKLE ALL ASPECTS OF THE DRUG PROBLEM. HE SAID HIS COUNTRY HOPED SUCH A SUMMIT COULD BE HELD BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR. THE FOREIGN MINISTER TOLD CANA THAT HIS COUNTRY HAD INDICATED TO THE UNITED STATES IN JANUARY A WILLINGNESS TO HOST THE SUMMIT BUT, TO DATE, THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM THE UNITED STATES ADMINISTRATION. "WE DISCUSSED THE IDEA OF THE SUMMIT AT THE CARICOM FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETING, THE HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MEETING, AT THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES AND WE INFORMED THE UNITED STATES BY DIPLOMATIC NOTE IN JANUARY OF OUR DESIRE TO HOST THE MEETING BUT SO FAR THE UNITED STATES HAS NOT RESPONDED. WHETHER WE WOULD ULTIMATELY GO AHEAD WITH IT I'M NOT SURE," CARTER EXPLAINED. CARTER WAS AGAINST USING UNITED STATES TROOPS IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS, POINT OUT THAT "THE DEMOCRATIC TRADITIONS IN SOME OF OUR COUNTRIES WOULD BE THREATENED IF WE WERE TO RESORT TO THE USE OF FORCE." HE SAID ARRANGEMENTS SUCH AS ONE BETWEEN HIS COUNTRY AND THE UNITED STATES FOR JOINT POLICING COULD EXTENDED TO INVOLVE OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE HEMISPHERE. THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT THREE QUARTERS OF THE DRUGS PRODUCED ARE CONSUMED IN NORTH AMERICA. "WE ARE NOT THE MARKETS. COUNTRIES LIKE THE BAHAMAS, JAMAICA, TRINIDAD, CUBA AND BARBADOS ARE ONLY USED BY THE DRUG LORDS TO REACH THE 3 BILLION DOLLAR UNITED STATES MARKET," HE REMARKED. "WE AREN'T REALLY THE TARGET AND THEREFORE WE MUST FOCUS ON THE QUESTION OF DEMAND. AND WE IN CARICOM, AND SPECIFICALLY IN THE BAHAMAS, ARE READY TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION TO THE UNITED STATES DRUG PROBLEM." CARTER SAID AMONG THE BENEFITS OF SUCH A SUMMIT WOULD BE "A JUDICIAL ATMOSPHERE" THAT WOULD LET THE DRUG BARONS, DEALERS AND USERS "KNOW THAT THEY ARE CRIMINALS WHEREVER THEY ARE OR WHEREVER THEY GO."
DEV-MUC3-0385	HAVANA , 22 AUG 89 -- THE FULL SCOPE OF THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE AND DEATH THAT HAS SWAMPED COLOMBIA OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS IS NOW BEGINNING TO BE ASSESSED. LATIN AMERICA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD HAVE REMAINED ON THE SIDELINES OF THAT SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRY'S DOMESTIC STRIFE, WHERE HUMAN LIFE IS ALMOST WORTHLESS. VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD WHEN HE TOLD COLOMBIAN RADIO CARACOL THAT WE MAY NOT BE DOING WHAT WE MUST CONCERNING CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN COLOMBIA. CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ IS CONCERNED THAT SOME NATIONS MAY BE GETTING USED TO LIVNG IN A CLIMATE OF COLLECTIVE INTIMIDATION. DAILY EVENTS OCCUR IN COLOMBIA AMID A CLIMATE OF NATIONAL UNCERTAINTY. BANDS OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE BUILT AN EMPIRE OF DIRTY MONEY AND BLOODTHIRSTY MAFIAS IN DEATHLY COMPLICITY WITH THE MILITARY DEPLOYMENT OF 140 PARAMILITARY GROUPS. YEARS AGO, WHEN THESE GROUPS ANNOUNCED THEIR GUNS WERE AIMED AT PROGRESSIVE AND LEFTIST PERSONALITIES, THEY OPERATED WITH THE UNSPOKEN COMPLICITY OF MANY SECTORS, INCLUDING THE GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER, FOR SOME TIME NOW, THE MURDER VICTIMS HAVE BEEN LEFTISTS, LIBERALS, CONSERVATIVES, AND EVEN POLITICALLY INDEPENDENT PERSONS WHO OPPOSE THE CHAOS CREATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS, LANDOWNERS, SOME OFFICERS, AND PARAMILITARY GROUPS. LUIS CARLOS GALAN, 46, PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL, LIBERAL SENATOR, LAWYER, AND NEWSMEN IS THE LATEST VICTIM OF THIS DEATHLY SPIRIAL. HIS REMAINS LUIS CARLOS GALAN. DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE SHOWN THEIR HIT LIST IS NEVERENDING. THEY ALSO BRING TO THE FORE THE POWER AND SCOPE OF THE DIRTY WAR THESE PEOPLE BEGAN IN THE COUNTRY AMID THE GOVERNMENT'S INACTION. MANY WONDER HOW THE PARAMILITARY TOP COMMAND CAN GO UNPUNISHED, CONSIDERING THAT ITS CHIEF LEADERS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED, BECAUSE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THE KILLERS DO VERY LITTLE TO COVER THEIR TRACKS. LOOKING AHEAD, THE COLOMBIAN ELECTORAL PROCESS THAT WILL CONCLUDE IN NEXT YEAR'S ELECTIONS HAS BEEN DEALT A HEAVY BLOW WITH GALAN'S MURDER. THE REMAINING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WILL HAVE TO CONDUCT THEIR POLITICAL CAMPAIGN SURROUNDED BY ARMIES OF BODYGUARDS, AN ARRANGEMENT WIDELY USED IN COLOMBIA BY POLITICIANS, LABOR LEADERS, JUDGES, ARTISTS, AND MINOR OFFICIALS. PERPLEXITY OVER WHAT HAPPENED IN COLOMBIA IS ONE OF THE INITIAL REACTIONS IN LATIN AMERICA. LUIS CARLOS GALAN'S MURDER ALSO CALLS FOR CONDEMNATION. PERHAPS IN THE FUTURE IT MAY HELP MAKE THE CONTINENT MEDITATE ON WHETHER OR NOT IT IS ADVISABLE TO BE INDIFFERENT TO THE COLLECTIVE INTIMIDATION THAT PREVAILS IN COLOMBIA.
DEV-MUC3-0386	GUATEMALA CITY, 25 AUG 89 -- THE KIDNAPPING OF FIVE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND THE MURDER OF A PROMINENT BUSINESSMAN IN GUATEMALA CITY THIS WEEK SHOOK THE COUNTRY AND UNLEASHED A WAVE OF CRITICISM AGAINST THE VINICIO CEREZO ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE OF WHAT CRITICS CALLED "ITS INABILITY TO PROVIDE SECURITY TO CITIZENS." SOME OF THE NEWSPAPER HEADLINES TODAY WERE: "RAMIRO CASTILLO'S MURDER CONDEMNED," "CRIME AGAINST BUSINESSMAN CAUSES GENERAL INDIGNATION," "DEPUTIES ASK FOR END TO VIOLENCE," "THE BLOODBATH MUST STOP," AND "CALL FOR GOVERNMENT MINISTER'S RESIGNATION." THE FIVE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WHO DISAPPEARED THIS WEEK ARE VICTOR HUGO RODRIGUEZ JARAMILLO, HIS WIFE, SILVIA MARIA AZURDIA UTRERA, IVAN ERNESTO GONZALEZ FUENTES, CARLOS CONDE, AND HUGO GRAMAJO. THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION OF THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE, WHICH EMERGED FROM THE ESQUIPULAS PEACE AGREEMENT, EXPRESSED ITS CONCERN TODAY OVER THE LATEST VIOLENCE WHICH, IT SAID, IS EVIDENCE OF THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE COUNTRY. THE COMMITTEE ASKED THAT THE LIVES OF THE KIDNAP VICTIMS BE RESPECTED AND IT ADDED THAT SOME OF THEM WERE "ARRESTED BY THE SECURITY FORCES IN THE CAPITAL AND THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR." RAMIRO CASTILLO, THE PRESIDENT OF THE BANCO INDUSTRIAL AND ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT GUATEMALAN BUSINESSMEN, WAS SHOT TO DEATH ON 24 AUGUST BY A GROUP OF ARMED MEN WHO ENTERED HIS HOUSE IN SANTA CATARIAN PINULA, 30 KM SOUTHWEST OF THE CAPITAL. THE AUTHORITIES SAID HE WAS KILLED WHEN HE TRIED TO PREVENT A THEFT FROM OCCURRING IN HIS HOUSE BUT SOURCES CLOSE TO THE FAMILY RULED OUT THAT POSSIBILITY. ONE OF CASTILLO'S CHILDREN, 23-YEAR-OLD RAMIRO, WAS ALSO WOUNDED IN THE INCIDENT. CASTILLO'S MURDER CAUSED ANGER, ESPECIALLY IN THE PRIVATE ENTERPRISE SECTOR. THE COORDINATING COMMITTEE OF FARMING, COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL, AND FINANCIAL ASSOCIATIONS , WHICH HOUSES THE PRIVATE SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS, BLAMED THE CEREZO ADMINISTRATION AND ESPECIALLY THE SECURITY FORCES "FOR THEIR INABILITY TO PROVIDE SECURITY TO CITIZENS, AND IT ASKED FOR GOVERNMENT MINISTER ROBERTO VALLE BALDIZAN'S RESIGNATION BECAUSE "HE HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN INCOMPETENT IN DOING HIS JOB."
DEV-MUC3-0387	MADRID , 28 AUG 89 -- INTERNATIONAL NEWS: WE OPEN THIS SECTION WITH THE CRISIS IN COLOMBIA AND WITH NEWS WHICH HAS JUST REACHED OUR NEWSROOM.

DEV-MUC3-0388	CLANDESTINE, 27 AUG 89 -- 1. ON SUNDAY 20 AUGUST, EIGHT FMLN DISABLED WAR COMRADES OCCUPIED THE CATHEDRAL, WHERE THEY REMAIN STILL TO PROTEST THE VIOLATIONS BY THE ARENA GOVERNMENT OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AS WELL AS NON-COMPLIANCE TO THE COMMITMENTS MADE WHEN THE RELEASE AND EXCHANGE OF COLONEL AVALOS WAS NEGOTIATED IN PANAMA . 2. THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND GREETS THE DISABLED COMRADES AND CONGRATULATES THEM ON DEMANDING THAT THEY BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND OBTAIN ADEQUATE MEDICAL ATTENTION. THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND ALSO CALLS ON THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO OFFER SOLIDARITY AND SUPPORT FOR THE JUST DEMANDS OF THE WAR DISABLED. WE RECOGNIZE AND ENCOURAGE THE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE THAT MSGR ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS IS GIVING IN FINDING A JUST SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM DESPITE THE GOVERNMENT HINDERING HIS WORK AS A MEDIATOR IN SOLVING THE CONFLICT. 3. ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, THE ARMED FORCES HAS ASSAULTED FMLN HOSPITALS, CAPTURED, TORTURED, AND MURDERED MEDICAL STAFF AND PATIENTS. ALSO, THEY HAVE CAPTURED, TORTURED, AND MURDERED DISABLED PERSONS IN VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS BEHAVIOR IS IN SHARP CONTRAST WITH THE FMLN'S STRICT RESPECT FOR THE HOSPITALS, MEDICAL STAFF, AS WELL AS THE ARMED FORCES' DISABLED AND WOUNDED PERSONNEL, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE VULNERABLE TARGETS OF OUR ACTIONS. THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND REITERATES THIS POLICY OF PRINCIPLES AND DEMANDS THE SAME BEHAVIOR FROM THE ARMED FORCES. 4. FOLLOWING THE OCCUPATION OF THE CATHEDRAL BY THE DISABLED, CRISTIANI IS TRYING TO MAKE THE CASE AN OBJECT OF NEGOTIATION, DEMANDING CERTAIN ACTIONS OF THE FMLN. THIS ATTITUDE BY THE ARENA GOVERNMENT MIGHT MAKE THE PROBLEM MORE COMPLEX AND MAKE US REVERT TO CIRCUMSTANCES WE HAD ALREADY SURPASSED. THE DEPARTURE FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE DISABLED IS A RIGHT THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD RESPECT, AND THIS CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AN ISSUE THAT CAN BE USED FOR NEGOTIATIONS OR BLACKMAIL. WE ARE SURE THAT THIS JUST DEMAND WHICH HAS LED THE DISABLED COMRADES TO STAY AT THE CATHEDRAL UNTIL THEY AND THEIR COMRADES CAN LEAVE THE COUNTRY WILL BE SUPPORTED BY ALL OF OUR PEOPLE, WHILE INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY WILL LEAVE IT CLEARLY ESTABLISHED THAT CRISTIANI, ARENA, AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE ACTING IN AN UNJUST AND INCORRECT MANNER. FMLN GENERAL COMMAND, 26 AUGUST 1989.

THE RELEASED POLICEMEN HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO THEIR SUPERIORS YET AND THEREFORE COULD NOT TALK TO THE MEDIA. THE ELN REPORTED THAT IT TREATED THE POLICEMEN WELL AND THAT THIS RELEASE IS AN ACTION IN FAVOR OF A MORE HUMANIZED WAR, WHICH IS A SLOGAN THESE GUERRILLAS HAVE PROCLAIMED IN THE PAST 5 YEARS.

DEV-MUC3-0390	LIMA, 28 AUG 89 -- INTERIOR MINISTER AGUSTIN MANTILLA TODAY SAID THAT BORDER CHECKPOINTS HAVE BEEN PLACED IN A STATE OF ALERT TO CLOSE THE BORDER TO COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WHO MAY SEEK SHELTER IN AN EFFORT TO ESCAPE THE COLOMBIAN POLICE. THE MINISTER ADDED THAT ANTISUBVERSIVE OPERATIONS HAVE FORCED TERRORIST GROUPS TO RETREAT AND TO ESCAPE INTO THE JUNGLE.
DEV-MUC3-0391	BOGOTA, 28 AUG 89 -- COMBINED ARMY AND POLICE FORCES HAVE RAIDED AN OFFICE IN DOWNTOWN BOGOTA THAT APPARENTLY SERVED AS THE "FINANCIAL HEADQUARTERS" OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKING GROUP HEADED BY GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT MEDELLIN CARTEL BOSS. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE TODAY BY THE COLOMBIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY. IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT THE AUTHORITIES DISCOVERED THE NUMBERS OF THE BANK ACCOUNTS THE DRUG TRAFFICKER HAS IN COLOMBIA AND ABROAD. THE AUTHORITIES CONFISCATED 30 SOPHISTICATED COMPUTERS, TELEFAX, AND OTHER ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT. THIS HAS BEEN ANOTHER SEVERE SETBACK FOR RODRIGUEZ GACHA, ONE OF THE MAFIA BOSSES MOST WANTED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. RODRIGUEZ GACHA, ALIAS THE MEXICAN, IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE RIGHT-HAND MAN OF PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, THE MEDELLIN CARTEL'S TOP BOSS. GACHA'S GROUP HAS SUFFERED MANY LOSSES DUE TO THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST COCAINE TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING IN COLOMBIA. OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, ELITE ARMY TROOPS HAVE SEIZED SEVERAL LARGE FARMS OWNED BY RODRIGUEZ GACHA IN THE TOWN OF PACHO, AS WELL AS LUXURIOUS RESIDENCES IN BOGOTA. A SON OF RODRIGUEZ GACHA, FREDDY RODRIGUEZ CELADES, AND THE GROUP'S "CHIEF OF FINANCES," FERNANDO GALEANO BERRIO--WHO IS WANTED BY THE U.S. AUTHORITIES--ARE BEING HELD BY COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES. HOWEVER, DESPITE THE "WAR" THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECLARED ON THE DRUG TRAFFICKING GANGS, A SUPERIOR COURT HAS REVOKED A WARRANT FOR THE ARREST OF ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, RODRIGUEZ GACHA, AND OTHER PERSONS LINKED TO MASSACRES CARRIED OUT BY RIGHTIST MILITARY GROUPS BEING TRAINED BY ISRAELI, BRITISH, U.S., AND WEST GERMAN MERCENARIES, ACCORDING TO THE INVESTIGATIONS. THE RULING WAS MADE KNOWN YESTERDAY. TODAY THE COUNTRY IS STILL AMAZED, CONSIDERING THAT THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT THE MAFIA LEADERS MASTERMINDED THE MASSACRES, AS REPORTED BY JUSTICE MARIA ELENA DIAZ, WHO WAS SHOT TO DEATH LAST MONTH, EVIDENTLY AS A REPRISAL FOR HAVING STATED THIS OPINION. THE ARREST WARRANT ALSO INCLUDED LUIS RUBIO ROJAS, A FORMER MAYOR OF THE TOWN OF PUERTO BOYACA, AN OPERATIONS CENTER OF RIGHTIST PARAMILITARY ELEMENTS, AND SEVERAL ARMY DETACHMENT ELEMENTS WHO REPORTEDLY PROMOTE TERRORIST SQUADRONS. IT HAS BEEN FULLY ESTABLISHED THAT ARMED ULTRA-RIGHTIST GROUPS HAVE BEEN TRAINED BY FOREIGN MERCENARIES, INCLUDING JAIR KLEIN, A FORMER ISRAELI ARMY COLONEL WHO COMMANDED HIS COUNTRY'S ANTITERRORIST CORPS SEVERAL YEARS AGO.
DEV-MUC3-0392	BOGOTA, 28 AUG 89 -- COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO SAID IN A MESSAGE "TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY," WHICH WAS ISSUED THIS EVENING BY THE PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC, THAT "THE SURVIVAL OF COLOMBIA, ONE OF THE MOST STABLE AND OLDEST DEMOCRACIES IN LATIN AMERICA, IS IN DANGER." THE COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT CATEGORICALLY STATED: "WE CANNOT REST UNTIL WE HAVE DESTROYED THE DRUG TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS. WE HAVE CAPTURED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND CONFISCATED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROPERTIES AND AIRCRAFT, AND WE WILL STEADFASTLY PURSUE THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS DESPITE THEIR RESOURCES AND MORE SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS." THE PRESIDENCY SAID THAT BARCO'S MESSAGE WAS ALSO BROADCAST BY THE MOST IMPORTANT TELEVISION NETWORKS IN THE UNITED STATES. DRUG TRAFFICKERS "MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE INTERNATIONAL FUGITIVES RUNNING FROM A CIVILIZED SOCIETY," BARCO SAID IN HIS MESSAGE. THE PRESIDENT ADDED THAT "THERE MUST BE NO RESPITE OR HOME FOR THEM" AND THAT "THERE MUST BE NO MARKET FOR THEIR DRUGS." BARCO'S DRAMATIC MESSAGE TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WAS BROADCAST SHORTLY AFTER IT WAS LEARNED THAT FABIO OCHOA RESTREPO, FATHER OF JORGE LUIS, FABIO, AND DAVID OCHOA VASQUEZ -- WHOSE EXTRADITION HAS BEEN REQUESTED BY THE U.S. AUTHORITIES -- SENT A PUBLIC LETTER TO BARCO PROPOSING THAT THEY START "WITH A CLEAN SLATE." BARCO ADDED THAT DRUG TRAFFICKING CARTELS HAVE TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT JUST STRUGGLING AGAINST COLOMBIA, BECAUSE "THE WHOLE WORLD IS UNITED IN ITS INDIGNATION AND IN ITS SOLIDARITY WITH THE ACTIONS WE ARE CURRENTLY CARRYING OUT." VIRGILIO BARCO SAID DRUG TRAFFICKING IS "A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE THAT IS BEING NURTURED BY THE HABITS OF MILLIONS OF COCAINE CONSUMERS, SOME OF WHOM ARE PROBABLY LISTENING." "THOSE WHO DEPEND ON COCAINE HAVE PERMITTED THE APPEARANCE OF THE MOST VIOLENT CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION THAT THE WORLD HAS KNOWN," THE PRESIDENT STATED. "WHAT INITIALLY SEEMED A MATTER OF PERSONAL HABITS HAS HAD EXPLOSIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR SOCIETY," HE ADDED. BARCO WARNED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY: "NATURALLY, IT IS MORE IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO REDUCE THE DEMAND THAN FOR US TO REDUCE THE OFFER. WE CANNOT FULLY DESTROY DRUG TRAFFICKING WHILE IT IS CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING EXTRAORDINARY PROFITS AND WHILE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PERSONS WHO CONSUME ILLEGAL DRUGS SOMEWHERE, IN SOME COUNTRY." THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT BEGAN AN ALL-OUT WAR AGAINST THE DRUG CARTELS 10 DAYS AGO, FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR AND LIBERAL PARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LUIS CARLOS GALAN ON 18 AUGUST.
DEV-MUC3-0393	MOSCOW , 28 AUG 89 -- IN VIEW OF THE RECENT INCIDENTS AT TOBALABA AIRPORT, THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE HAS ISSUED THE FOLLOWING COMMUNIQUE: THE DICTATORSHIP INTENDS TO USE STILL UNCLEAR INCIDENTS THAT TOOK PLACE A FEW DAYS AGO AT TOBALABA AIRPORT TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF PROVOCATION AND ALARM WITH THE PURPOSE OF DISRUPTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE POLITICAL PROCESS THAT SHOULD LEAD TO A DEMOCRATIC VICTORY ON 14 DECEMBER. PINOCHET'S OPEN INTERVENTION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS REMAINED CLEAR IN HIS 23 AUGUST SPEECH AND WAS RECENTLY DENOUNCED BY OPPOSITION LEADER PATRICIO AYLWIN AND BY ALL OPPOSITION POLITICAL FORCES. THE DECLARATION ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER, CNI -- AN ORGANIZATION THAT FOR MANY YEARS HAS SHAMEFULLY VIOLATED THE MOST BASIC RIGHTS OF THE CHILEAN PEOPLE BY USING THE MOST CRUEL AND INHUMAN FORMS OF TERROR AND VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILEAN DEMOCRATS AND WHOSE DISSOLUTION HAS BEEN PROPOSED EVEN BY THE GOVERNMENT'S CANDIDATE HERNAN BUCHI -- INTENDS TO MISGUIDE THE PEOPLE BY ONCE AGAIN TRYING TO IMPLICATE THE PCCH IN AN INCIDENT IN WHICH IT HAD NO PARTICIPATION WHATSOEVER. THE CNI DECLARATION, EXPRESSLY ORDERED BY AUTHORITIES OF THE REGIME, GOES TO THE EXTREME OF INFAMOUSLY MANIPULATING FAMILY TIES TO ATTACK OUR GENERAL SECRETARY, COMRADE VOLODIA TEITELBOIM. THE REGIME SEEKS TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF TERROR AND INTIMIDATION IN ORDER TO IMPOSE THE ANTIDEMOCRATIC DEMANDS RECENTLY MADE BY PINOCHET. TO THIS END, AND AS PINOCHET HIMSELF HAS STATED, THE REGIME IS WILLING EVEN TO RESORT TO FORCE ONCE AGAIN. PART OF THIS PLAN IS THE MURDER OF LUIS VARGAS, WHO WAS ARRESTED AND TORTURED BY THE CNI AND LATER THROWN OUT OF A FIFTH- FLOOR WINDOW OF THE MILITARY COURT BUILDING AFTER BEING FALSELY CHARGED WITH HAVING AN ARSENAL IN HIS HOME; THE SCANDALOUS COURT DECISION THAT LEAVES UNPUNISHED THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INHUMAN DEATH OF RODRIGO ROJAS DENEGRI AND THE SERIOUS INJURY OF CARMEN GLORIA QUINTANA; THE SHAMEFUL SUPREME COURT DECISION CLEARING THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HORRIBLE CRIMES AGAINST 10 CHILEANS IN LATE 1976; THE REGIME'S INTENTION TO IMPOSE A NEW AMNESTY LAW TO LEAVE THOUSANDS OF CASES OF VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE PAST 16 YEARS UNPUNISHED; THE ARREST AND INCOMMUNICADO DETENTION OF 13 PEOPLE, AMONG THEM A PREGNANT WOMAN ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENTS AT THE TOBALABA AIRPORT AND FOR WHOSE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL INTEGRITY WE FEAR. THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF PINOCHET, THE CNI, AND THE CIRCLES CLOSE TO THE DICTATORSHIP'S DESPAIR IN VIEW OF THE PROGRESS MADE BY THE DEMOCRATIC STRUGGLE AND THE GROWING UNITY OF ALL OPOSITION FORCES AROUND A SINGLE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND A COMMON PLATFORM DESIGNED TO DEMOCRATIZE THE COUNTRY. AS ALWAYS WHEN IT FEELS THREATENED, THE DICTATORSHIP HAS DECIDED TO DIVIDE AND CONFUSE THE OPPOSITION FORCES. WE APPEAL TO ALL DEMOCRATS TO COME TOGETHER EVEN MORE FIRMLY SO THE LEVEL OF UNITY ACHIEVED BY THE OPPOSITION SECTOR WILL NOT ALLOW SUCH MANEUVERS TO JEOPARDIZE THE RESOLUTE PROGRESS TOWARD THE MUCH DESIRED DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM FOR OUR PEOPLE. WE ALSO URGE THAT THIS PROVOCATION BE DENOUNCED BY DOUBLING EFFORTS TO OVERWHELMINGLY DEFEAT THE DICTATORSHIP ON 14 DECEMBER, THUS TAKING A DECISIVE STEP IN THE STRUGGLE TO DEFINITIVELY OUST THIS REGIME OF HATRED, DEATH, AND PAIN. SIGNED: AMERICO ZORRILLA, JAIME INSUNZA, AND CARLOS MOLINAS FOR THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE.
DEV-MUC3-0394	BOGOTA, 29 AUG 89 -- SEVEN POWERFUL BOMBS WERE SET OFF IN BOGOTA AND MEDELLIN EARLY THIS MORNING IN WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE CONTINUATION OF THE "WAR" DECLARED BY THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN REPRISAL FOR THE MAJOR BLOWS THEY HAVE BEEN DEALT BY THE AUTHORITIES IN VARIOUS AREAS OF COLOMBIA. ACCORDING TO THE INITIAL POLICE REPORTS, SIX BOMBS EXPLODED IN MEDELLIN, THE COUNTRY'S SECOND-LARGEST CITY, WHERE THE RESPONSE FROM THE DRUG DEALERS HAS BEEN MORE STRONGLY FELT IN RECENT DAYS. THE BOMBS WERE PLACED IN LIQUOR STORES WHERE, ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL ESTIMATES, THE DAMAGE IS EXTENSIVE. MEDELLIN WAS THE FIRST CITY HIT BY THE DRUG CARTEL'S "COUNTERATTACK" AFTER THE SO-CALLED "EXTRADITABLES" ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE IN WHICH THEY VOWED TO WAGE A "WAR" ON THE GOVERNMENT, JUDGES, BUSINESSMEN, AND JOURNALISTS NATIONWIDE. THE EXTRADITABLES ARE DRUG TRAFFICKERS SOUGHT BY U.S. COURTS. ON SUNDAY, NINE BOMBS EXPLODED AND COMPLETELY DESTROYED SEVERAL STATE-OWNED BANKS. MEANWHILE, ANOTHER BOMB EXPLODED IN BOGOTA IN FRONT OF A TRAVEL AGENCY, BUT THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE HAS YET TO BE REPORTED. THE INTENSE OFFENSIVE BY PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S ADMINISTRATION BEGAN 2 WEEKS AGO IN THE WAKE OF A NUMBER OF CRIMINAL ATTACKS THAT CLAIMED THE LIVES OF PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LUIS CARLOS GALAN, A HIGH-RANKING POLICE OFFICER, AND A JUDGE. THE POLICE REPORTED TODAY THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME, COMBINED ARMY AND POLICE FORCES RAIDED SEVERAL PROPERTIES OWNED BY HERNANDO SUAREZ BURGOS, THE RULING LIBERAL PARTY, IN SOUTHWESTERN NARINO DEPARTMENT. UNITS OF THE ELITE FORCES, THE MAIN ONES INVOLVED IN THE OPERATIONS, ALSO RAIDED THE PRIVATE RESIDENCE OF BUSINESSMAN EDGARDO BARROS, PRESIDENT OF THE SPORTING SOCCER CLUB OF CALI. POLICE SPOKESMEN ALSO REPORTED TODAY THAT MORE THAN 7,000 PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE OFFENSIVE WERE RELEASED WHEN IT WAS FULLY PROVEN THEY HAD NO LINKS WITH THE DRUG MAFIAS. MEANWHILE, APPROXIMATELY 4,000 PEOPLE REMAIN IN CUSTODY AWAITING JUDICIAL RULINGS.
DEV-MUC3-0395	BOGOTA, 29 AUG 89 -- FOREIGN CRIMINALS, INCLUDING A PERSON OF ARAB ORIGIN, PARTICIPATED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR LUIS CARLOS GALAN, THE LIBERAL PARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WHO WAS GUNNED DOWN IN BOGOTA ON 18 AUGUST, ACCORDING TO GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ, CHIEF OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY . "THERE IS A PERSON OF ARAB ORIGIN, WHO APPARENTLY HAS BEEN LINKED CLOSELY TO THE CRIME," MAZA MARQUEZ TOLD THE MEDIA TODAY AFTER MEETING WITH COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS, WITH WHOM HE DISCUSSED THE DRAFTING OF NEW SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES. THE SUSPECT, JUBIS HAZVUMB , WHO WAS ARRESTED ALONG WITH FOUR OTHER COLOMBIANS IN BOGOTA 2 DAYS AFTER GALAN'S ASSASSINATION, "IS VERY MUCH INVOLVED," SAID MAZA, WHO IN LATE MAY WAS THE TARGET OF A DYNAMITE ATTACK CARRIED OUT IN BOGOTA, IN WHICH HE WAS NOT WOUNDED. "WE HAVE RECEIVED ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO CONFIRM THAT FOREIGNERS PARTICIPATED IN SENATOR GALAN'S ASSASSINATION," THE DAS CHIEF SAID. HE ADDED THAT THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT TO LOCATE THE PERPETRATORS HAVE SO FAR BEEN SUCCESSFUL. "WE HAVE REACHED THE CONCLUSION THAT MANY PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN GALAN'S MURDER AND THAT IT WAS WELL-PLANNED," MAZA SAID. HE ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WILL RECEIVE, STARTING TODAY, ADDITIONAL PERSONAL SECURITY PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT.
DEV-MUC3-0396	JERUSALEM , 29 AUG 89 -- BEFORE ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF COLOMBIA, MINISTER SHAHAL POINTED OUT: I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT ANY CARTELS IN COLOMBIA, NOR DID I MEET ANY CATTLE BREEDERS WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT RELATIONSHIP WITH COLOMBIA IN SEVERAL VERY CONCRETE SPHERES. THESE INCLUDE THE PURCHASE OF COAL, FOR WHICH WE SIGNED A 4-YEAR CONTRACT DURING MY VISIT THERE ABOUT A YEAR AGO. THAT CONTRACT HAS BEEN FULFILLED TO THE SATISFACTION OF BOTH SIDES. THE COLOMBIAN COAL IS EXCELLENT, AS IS THE PRICE WE PAY FOR IT. WE ARE A VERY GOOD CUSTOMER, AND THE RELATIONS BETWEEN US ARE VERY CLOSE. BY THE WAY, THE TRADE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES WAS FORMULATED BY THE LADY IN THE NEWS, MONICA DE GREIFF, WHO WAS THE ENERGY MINISTRY DIRECTOR GENERAL DURING MINISTER SHAHAL'S VISIT TO COLUMBIA. AT PRESENT SHE IS BOGOTA'S JUSTICE MINISTER, AND IS HIDING IN THE UNITED STATES FROM THE DRUG CARTEL'S ASSASSINATION THREATS. MINISTER SHAHAL STRESSED THAT IN HIS MEETINGS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION HEADS IN COLOMBIA, THE LATTER HAD LAVISHED PRAISE ON THE ASSISTANCE EXTENDED BY OUR DEFENSE SECTOR TO COLOMBIA. IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE. ISRAEL TRAINED COLOMBIAN DEFENSE ESTABLISHMENT ELEMENTS; THIS WAS DONE IN THE CUSTOMARY WAY AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE DEFENSE MINISTER. COLOMBIA BOUGHT SECURITY PRODUCTS FROM ISRAEL, SUCH AS THE KFIR PLANES, WHICH WERE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COAL PURCHASE. ON THE DAY I MET WITH THE COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT HE SIGNED AN ORDER APPROVING THE PURCHASE OF THE KFIR PLANES BY THE COLOMBIAN AIR FORCE. A DAY LATER WE SIGNED THE COAL AGREEMENT. THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE DEAL WAS ABOUT $200 TO $250 MILLION FOR EACH SIDE.
DEV-MUC3-0397	BOGOTA, 29 AUG 89 -- FIVE HUNDRED COLOMBIAN JUDGES HAVE ANNOUNCED THEIR "JOINT RESIGNATION" IN PROTEST OF THE ABOLITION OF THE JURY, WHICH MAKES THE JUDGES FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR A SENTENCE. THE JUDGES HAVE ALSO COMPLAINED THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH OFFICIAL PROTECTION. THE JUDICIAL BRANCH NATIONAL ASSOCIATION REPORTED TODAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT DECISION -- WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON 28 AUGUST -- "REPRESENTS A GRAVE DANGER FOR THE JUDGES, BECAUSE THEY ARE FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR DECLARING A PERSON GUILTY AND CONDEMNING THE CULPRITS." A GROUP OF LITIGANT LAWYERS ALSO ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THEY WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN PUBLIC HEARINGS UNTIL THE REINSTATEMENT OF THE JURY, WHOSE ABOLITION THEY CONSIDER UNCONSTITUTIONAL. ASONAL SECRETARY GENERAL ORLANDO MORALES TOLD EFE THAT THE JOINT RESIGNATION INVOLVES 550 JUDGES IN BOGOTA AND CUNDINAMARCA, THE DEPARTMENT IN WHICH THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL IS LOCATED. THE RESIGNATION COULD BE ANNOUNCED DURING THE WEEKEND AS A "CONTINUATION" OF THE 16 AUGUST STRIKE, WHEN 4,600 JUDGES DEMANDED MORE PROTECTION TO DO THEIR WORK, MORALES ADDED. MORE THAN 200 OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN MURDERED SINCE THE COLOMBIAN JUSTICE SYSTEM BEGAN ITS STRUGGLE AGAINST THE DRUG LORDS IN 1981. THREE JUDGES HAVE BEEN MURDERED SO FAR THIS YEAR. THEY WERE IN CHARGE OF LAWSUITS AGAINST THE MOST SOUGHT AFTER DRUG TRAFFICKING LEADERS IN THE COUNTRY. THE LAWSUITS WERE LATER SUSPENDED. COLOMBIAN JUSTICE MINISTER MONICA DE GREIFF TRAVELED TO THE UNITED STATES ON 25 AUGUST TO REQUEST $2.5 MILLION IN AID TO GUARANTEE THE PROTECTION OF COLOMBIAN JUDGES AND THEIR RELATIVES. THE MINISTER AND HER 3-YEAR-OLD SON HAVE BEEN THREATENED BY THE DRUG TRAFFICKING MAFIAS.
DEV-MUC3-0398	BOGOTA, 29 AUG 89 -- THE COLOMBIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY IN BOGOTA CONFIRMED TODAY THAT AT LEAST THREE-FOURTHS OF THE 10,797 PEOPLE ARRESTED AFTER SENATOR LUIS CARLOS GALAN'S MURDER ON 18 AUGUST HAVE BEEN RELEASED. THE RELEASES TOOK PLACE AS THE PREVENTIVE ARREST DEADLINES ESTABLISHED IN THE STATE OF SIEGE DECREES ISSUED ON 25 AUGUST BY PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S LIBERAL GOVERNMENT BEGAN TO EXPIRE. COLONEL EDUARDO AREVALO, PRESS DIRECTOR FOR THE DEFENSE MINISTRY, TOLD AFP THAT THE AUTHORITIES COULD ONLY DETAIN SUSPECTS FOR 7 WORKING DAYS. IT IS QUITE DIFFERENT WHEN ARRESTS ARE MADE ON SPECIFIC DRUG TRAFFICKING CHARGES, HE EXPLAINED. "THERE ARE NO EXACT FIGURES REGARDING THE PERSONS RELEASED, BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT AT LEAST THREE-FOURTHS OF THE DETAINEES ARE INVOLVED," COL AREVALO SAID. THAT PROPORTION OF THE ALMOST 10,797 DETENTIONS MADE DURING THE OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AGAINST COMMON CRIMINALS AND PRESUMED ACCOMPLICES OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKING MAFIAS, LEADS TO THE ASSUMPTION THAT APPROXIMATELY 3,500 PEOPLE REMAIN IN CUSTODY AT THE JAILS, POLICE INSPECTION OFFICES, AND OTHER BRANCHES. THE LEGAL SITUATION OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL BE ESTABLISHED AS THEIR TERMS EXPIRE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW, AREVALO SAID. AREVALO EXPLAINED TO AFP THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW DIFFICULTIES REGARDING THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DETAINED AND ARRESTED, ADDING THAT THE DIFFICULTIES STEM FROM THE WORK STOPPAGE IN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IN PROTEST OVER THE ASSASSINATION OF JUSTICE CARLOS VALENCIA IN BOGOTA. HE SAID THAT AMONG THE DETAINEES ARE THREE INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD BE EXTRADITED TO THE UNITED STATES. ONE OF THE EXTRADITABLES IS EDUARDO MARTINEZ ROMERO, CAPTURED WHILE HE WAS VACATIONING ON HIS FARM IN TOLU, A VILLAGE IN THE NORTHWESTERN PROVINCE OF SUCRE ON THE CARIBBEAN COAST, APPROXIMATELY 750 KM FROM BOGOTA, AND HIS TRANSFER TO THE UNITED STATES COULD COME AT ANY MOMENT. THE PROCEDURES FOR MARTINEZ ROMERO'S EXTRADITION WERE CARRIED OUT UNEVENTFULLY AFTER THE U.S. EMBASSY MADE THE REQUEST. HOWEVER, IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT HIS EXTRADITION MAY BE POSTPONED FOR A FEW DAYS BECAUSE THE SUPREME COURT SUSPENDED THE DEADLINES FOR THE ELECTION OF JUSTICES AT 27 HIGHER COURTS. THE SUPREME COURT'S CONSTITUTIONAL CHAMBER AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE 10 WORKING DAYS TO STATE THEIR POSITIONS REGARDING THE LEGALITY OF THE EXECUTIVE DECREES, WITHOUT WHICH THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO ABSTAIN FROM AUTHORIZING FUTURE EXTRADITIONS. "WE MUST NOT ACT HASTILY BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT TO MAKE ERRORS. SOME OF THE EXTRADITABLES MAY BE INNOCENT," COMMUNICATIONS MINISTER CARLOS LEMUS TOLD AFP.
DEV-MUC3-0399	BOGOTA, 30 AUG 89 -- THE RESIGNATIONS OF THREE OF THE JUDGES IN CHARGE OF INVESTIGATING THE MURDERS OF THE GOVERNOR OF ANTIOQUIA, ANOTHER JUDGE, AND THE ANTIOQUIA POLICE COMMANDER, WERE ANNOUNCED TODAY.

AMONG THE MEASURES PLANNED BY THE METROPOLITAN POLICE FOR THE CURFEW THAT BEGINS TONIGHT IN MEDELLIN ARE THE INSTALLATION OF 18 CHECKPOINTS STRATEGICALLY LOCATED AT THE METROPOLITAN AREA'S LEADING ENTRANCES AND EXITS. THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY POLICEMEN WILL GUARD THE CHECKPOINTS AND CONDUCT SEARCHES. THEY WILL WORK AROUND-THE- CLOCK SEARCHING VEHICLES AND INDIVIDUALS TRAVELING IN THOSE AREAS. THE NINE PERMANENT AND NINE MOBILE CHECKPOINTS WILL BE USEFUL IN LOCATING WEAPONS, EXPLOSIVES, DRUGS, CRIMINALS, AND STOLEN VEHICLES. SEVERAL OF THE CHECKPOINTS WILL BE REINFORCED WITH ARMORED ANTIRIOT VEHICLES IN ANTICIPATION OF CLASHES.

DEV-MUC3-0401	CARACAS , 30 AUG 89 -- DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL FILMO LOPEZ UZCATEGUI CONFIRMED TODAY THAT VENEZUELAN SOLDIERS ARE BEING DEPLOYED TO THE COLOMBIAN BORDER IN AN EFFORT TO DETECT THE POSSIBLE FLIGHT OF GUERRILLAS OR DRUG TRAFFICKERS FOLLOWING THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRY'S SECURITY FORCES, AFTER THE MURDER OF LIBERAL LEADER LUIS CARLOS GALAN. ALTHOUGH THE DEFENSE MINISTER DESCRIBED THE SITUATION ON THE BORDER AS "NORMAL," HE SAID THAT THE MILITARY PRESENCE IS BEING REINFORCED IN APURE STATE ON THE COLOMBIAN BORDER. LOPEZ UZCATEGUI SAID: "I HAVE ISSUED VERY PRECISE INSTRUCTIONS TO FURTHER REINFORCE SURVEILLANCE AND CONTROL WITH MILITARY PERSONNEL," AND HE UNDERSCORED THAT MILITARY COMMANDS FROM BOTH COUNTRIES ARE IN CONSTANT CONTACT. THE MINISTER DID NOT DIRECTLY DENY THE POSSIBILITY THAT DRUG TRAFFICKERS MAY HAVE ENTERED VENEZUELAN TERRITORY, BUT HE STRESSED THAT "THE MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED ARE YIELDING RESULTS."
DEV-MUC3-0402	GUATEMALA CITY, 30 AUG 89 -- THE LOCAL PRESS REPORTED TODAY THAT A FORMER LAW STUDENT WHO HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED HAS BEEN FOUND MURDERED IN A DISTRICT IN NORTHERN GUATEMALA CITY.

THE SOURCE SAID THAT LIBERTO GUTIERREZ HAD RECENTLY DISAPPEARED AND APPARENTLY HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED BY MAOIST PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY GUERRILLAS, BUT THIS WAS NOT CONFIRMED.

FAC FIGHTER PLANES CHASED THE THIEVES UP TO LIBERDO GUTIERREZ' FARM AND BOMBED BOTH THE AIRCRAFT AND THE LANDING STRIP, AS WELL AS THE NAPOLES FARM, KILLING A COOK WHO WORKED IN ESCOBAR'S HOUSE. AS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE OWNER OF THE FARM AND LANDING STRIP USED BY THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS WAS ALSO THE BROTHER OF ALFREDO GUTIERREZ, WHO WAS APPOINTED ATTORNEY GENERAL OF COLOMBIA FOLLOWING THE MURDER OF CARLOS MAURO HOYOS ON 25 JANUARY 1988. BECAUSE OF THE SUSPICION THAT HIS BROTHER WAS A FRONT MAN FOR PABLO ESCOBAR, ATTORNEY GENERAL ALFREDO GUTIERREZ RESIGNED ON 28 MARCH 1988, 2 MONTHS AFTER ASSUMING HIS POST.

JOSE MANUEL MARTIN MEDEM REPORTS: THE EXILES FROM CHILE, ARGENTINA, AND URUGUAY REPEATEDLY STATED THAT WHILE THERE WERE MILITARY DICTATORSHIPS IN THEIR COUNTRIES, THE ARMED FORCES OF THE SOUTHERN HALF OF LATIN AMERICA ACTED JOINTLLY, WITHOUT RESPECTING BORDERS, IN REPRESSION. IN THIS WAY, THEY WERE ABLE TO KIDNAP AN EXILE FROM WHERE HE HAD TAKEN REFUGE AND MAKE HIM RETURN TO THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN, WHERE MANY WERE TORTURED AND MURDERED. OUR COLLEAGUE, JAVIER GONZALEZ, HAS NOW MANAGED A WITNESS REPORT THAT CONFIRMS THESE ACCUSATIONS. A FORMER MEMBER OF DINA , THE CHILEAN SECRET SERVICE UNDER PINOCHET, HAS ASKED REQUESTED POLITICAL ASYLUM IN SPAIN. HE IS JUAN JOSE SOTO VARGAS, WHO WORKED IN THE DINA CITIZENS' INTELLIGENCE BRIGADE. HE HAS TURNED AWAY FROM THE REGIME, ALTHOUGH HE MAINTAINED HIS IDEOLOGICAL STANCE. SOTO VARGAS, A DOCTOR BY PROFESSION AND A PASTOR OF AN EVANGELICAL CHURCH, HAS MADE EXCLUSIVE STATEMENTS TO MADRID RADIO IN WHICH HE CONFIRMS POLICE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE REGION'S MILITARY GOVERNMENTS DURING THE PERIOD OF STATE TERRORISM. WE, IN THE CHILEAN EMBASSY, WORKED WITH THE ARGENTINE FEDERAL POLICE AND WITH THE ARGENTINE ARMED FORCES IN THE FIGHT AGAINST SUBVERSION IN 1976 AND SHORTLY BEFORE ISABEL MARTINEZ DE PERON LEFT POWER. WE ALSO WORKED JOINTLY WITH THE SECURITY FORCES OF URAGUAY, PARAGUAY, AND BRAZIL. I WORKED IN THE CHILEAN EMBASSY IN BRAZIL WITH THE AGREEMENT OF THE NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICE OF THE BRAZILIAN CENTRAL AGENCY. WELL, RELATIONS WERE THE BEST AND THIS WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE THE SOUTH AMERICAN ARMED FORCES, AT TO INSTALL ITSELF IN SOUTH AMERICA OR TO IMPOSE ITSELF THROUGH GUERRILLA TACTICS AND VIOLENCE. SOTO VARGAS HAS ALREADY REQUESTED POLITICAL ASYLUM IN OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, WHICH HE HAS HAD TO LEAVE FOR DIFFERENT REASONS. HE SAYS THAT HE DID NOT TORTURE OR KILL ANYONE AND THAT THINGS LIKE THIS DID NOT HAPPEN IN CHILE. HOWEVER, HE ADMITS THAT GENERAL CARLOS PRATS, THE HEAD OF THE ARMY UNDER PRESIDENT ALLENDE, WAS ASSASSINATED IN BUENOS AIRES UNDER ORDERS OF THE PINOCHET GOVERNMENT. THERE IS PROOF, EVEN JUDICIAL PROOF, THAT THERE WAS PARTICIPATION BY HIGH-RANKING MEMBERS OF THE CHILEAN ARMY WHO WERE ORDERED TO CARRY OUT ASSASSINATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN I WORKED IN THE MILITARY SECTION OF THE CHILEAN EMBASSY IN ARGENTINA, GEN VICTOR HUGO BARRIERA BARRIERA OF THE ARMY INTELLIGENCE SERVICE AN THERE WAS TALK IN THE CHILEAN EMBASSY THAT THE CHILEAN HIGH-RANKING OFFICER HAD ORDERED THE PHYSICAL EXTERMINATION OF PRATS.

FATHER CORO ACCUSED THE "ATLACATL" BATTALION SOLDIERS, PARTICULARLY AN OFFICER, "A LIEUTENANT, SERGEANT, OR WHOMEVER," WHO LATER ATTEMPTED TO DISTORT THE EVENT BY STATING THAT THE YOUNG STUDENT WAS A "REBEL" BECAUSE HE WORE REBEL BOOTS AND HAD A REBEL BOOK. THE SALESIAN PRIEST, WHO HAS LIVED IN THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY FOR THE PAST 16 YEARS, SAID THAT THE STUDENT WAS RETURNING HOME AFTER WORKING ON HIS THESIS AS HE WAS TO GRADUATE THIS YEAR. THE STUDENT WORE THE SCHOOL'S UNIFORM, HAD HIS IDENTIFICATION PAPERS, AND CARRIED A BOOK ON RELIGION THAT SHOWED JESUS CHRIST WITH A BEARD ON ITS COVER. FATHER CORO STATED THAT SINCE IT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO KILL AN INNOCENT YOUNG MAN WHO WAS AN HONOR STUDENT, THE SOLDIERS HAD STARTED TO KEEP A WATCH ON THE INSTITUTE, TO STOP STUDENTS TO HARRASS THEM MENTALLY BY ASKING THEM IF THEY KNEW MIRANDA REINA, TO PLACE A CHECKPOINT IN FRONT OF THE MURDERED STUDENT'S HOME, AND OTHER SIMILAR MEASURES. HE ADDED THAT IF THESE MEASURES ARE NOT STOPPED, THE SALESIAN COMMUNITY IN EL SALVADOR WILL PROTEST TO THE MILITARY HIGH COMMAND.

"I AM SURE THAT THEY ARE IN COLOMBIAN TERRITORY. WE HAVE EVIDENCE TO THAT EFFECT," THE GENERAL SAID, ADDING THAT THE POLICE "HAVE AN ENTIRE UNIT READY TO BE TAKEN TO ANY POINT OF THE COUNTRY AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE" SHOULD ANY OF THE "CAPOS" BE FOUND. SOME OF THE 12 "EXTRADITABLES" -- JORGE LUIS, JUAN DAVID, FABIO OCHOA, PABLO ESCOBAR, GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, AND GILBERTO RODRIGUEZ OREJUELA -- HAVE BEEN POINTED OUT AS BEING THE KINGPINS OF THE CALI AND MEDELLIN NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING GROUPS. THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR EXPORTING 80 PERCENT OF THE COCAINE USED IN THE UNITED STATES. ALTHOUGH HE ADMITTED THAT THE POLICE DO NOT HAVE "EXACT INFORMATION," GEN GOMEZ PADILLA POINTED OUT THAT MANY OF THE DOCUMENTS SEIZED IN THE LAST 2 WEEKS FROM THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS-- INVENTORIES, ACCOUNTS, AND PROPERTY TITLES--"ALLOW US TO PROGRESS IN OUR CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING NETWORKS."

WITH THIS REMARK, GEN GOMEZ AGAIN REJECTED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE UNITED STATES MIGHT SEND TROOPS TO FIGHT THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING GROUPS IN COLOMBIAN TERRITORY. "THE FACT WE NEED EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGICAL SUPPORT IS SOMETHING ELSE," THE POLICE CHIEF SAID, ADDING THAT "WE WELCOME ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY." GOMEZ PADILLA POINTED OUT THAT "AS NEVER BEFORE, THE ARMY, THE SECRET AGENTS, AND THE POLICE ARE TRULY COMITTED TO THE STRUGGLE AND HAVE ASSIGNED 80,000 UNITS TO FIGHT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AGAINST NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING." AS OF 18 AUGUST, WHEN THE GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED ITS MOST RECENT OFFENSIVE AGAINST NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING AND ADOPTED MEASURES THAT INCLUDED EXTRADITON, THE PRODUCTION AND MARKETING OF COCAINE "HAS NEARLY STOPPED," GOMEZ PADILLA SAID. THE GENERAL STATED THAT THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS ARE SEEKING NEW MARKETING ROUTES AND NEW BORDER AREAS TO INSTALL THE COCAINE REFINING LABORATORIES. HE ADDED THE COLOMBIAN TOPOGRAPHY -- MOUNTAINOUS AND WITH VERY DENSE JUNGLES -- CONCEALS THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS AND THEIR INSTALLATIONS, "BUT SOONER OR LATER WE ARE GOING TO FIND THEM; THEY CANNOT HIDE FOREVER."

DEV-MUC3-0421	MOSCOW , NO DATE -- FULLY AWARE OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CHALLENGE, THE PCCH AND THE LEFTIST SECTOR, AS PART OF THE OPPOSITION, WILL SPARE NO SACRIFICE TO SECURE AN IMPORTANT VICTORY BY ELECTING PATRICIO AYLWIN PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND ESTABLISHING A DECISIVE MAJORITY IN CONGRESS FOR THE OPPOSITION, INCLUDING THE UNITED LEFT AND THE PAIS . IN OUR OPINION, SAID VOLODIA TEITELBOIM, THIS IS NOT JUST AN ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN. WE DO NOT SEE IT AS SEPARATE FROM THE SOCIAL MOBILIZATION CARRIED OUT BY PEOPLE BURDENED BY HUNDREDS OF DAILY PROBLEMS, A MOBILIZATION TO RECOVER THEIR RIGHTS TO FOOD, JOBS, HEALTH, HOUSING, AND EDUCATION -- TO A WAY OF LIFE WORTHY OF HUMAN BEINGS. FIVE OR SIX MILLION HUNGRY AND POOR CHILEANS IS A SCANDAL, AND THEY DESERVE A SHARE OF THE WEALTH OF THOSE WHO TOOK OVER THE COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENT. WE NEED TO DEMAND AND DEFEND THE RESPECT FOR LIFE THAT HAS NOT BEEN GUARANTEED DURING THESE PAST 16 YEARS IN OUR FATHERLAND. A SINGLE DAY DOES NOT GO BY WITHOUT A DEFENDER OF FREEDOM BECOMING A VICTIM OF THE REGIME'S REPRESSIVE APPARATUS. THE COMMUNIST REPRESENTATIVE ADDED: WE WANT PEACE FOR CHILE. WE WANT THE DEADLY VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM UNLEASHED ON 11 SEPTEMBER 1973 TO END ONCE AND FOR ALL. THE CHILEAN DILEMMA CONTINUES TO BE DEMOCRACY OR DICTATORSHIP, LIBERTY OR TYRANNY, PERPETUATION IN POWER OR A NEW LIFE. VOLODIA TEITELBOIM HAS INDEED MADE A CALL TO GET ORGANIZED, TO UNITE, AND TO CONVINCE. THE PERPETUATION OF POWER IS NOW CALLED HERNAN BUCHI. WE MUST ALL UNITE TO DEFEAT PINOCHET. BUCHI IS HIS MAN. TEITELBOIM POINTED OUT THAT THE PEOPLE DID NOT MAKE A MISTAKE. THEY JUST HAD TO CHANGE A LETTER OF BUCHI'S PROPAGANDISTIC SLOGANS TO RESTORE THE TRUTH: BUCHI IS NOT THE MAN; RATHER, HE REPRESENTS HUNGER. IN ITS 15TH CONGRESS THE PCCH MADE A CALL TO DEFEAT THE MINISTER WHO HAS MADE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE POOR, THE MINISTER WHO HAS NOW BECOME A DEMAGOGUE AND IS PROMISING THE MOON AND AN UNREALISTIC WORLD FOR THE PEOPLE; THAT IS, THE MINISTER WHO IS PROMISING EVERYTHING HE FAILED TO ACCOMPLISH IN HIS YEARS AS MINISTER. BUCHI'S INSINCERE PROMISES ARE SURPASSED ONLY BY ANOTHER TALKATIVE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THE REGIME: MR ERRAZURIZ. VOLODIA TEITELBOIM THEN ADDED: IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE THE VICTORY OF DEMOCRACY, IT IS NECESSARY TO ORGANIZE THE UNITED FORCES OF ALL THOSE WHO HOPE FOR LIBERTY. WE HEREBY CALL FOR THE CREATION OF MILLIONS OF COMMANDOS FOR DEMOCRACY AND BROAD COMMITTEES ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO DISPLAY INITIATIVES, ENCOURAGE IMAGINATION, AND FORM CARAVANS OF PEOPLE WHO WILL GIVE EXPLANATIONS FROM DOOR TO DOOR AND FROM PERSON TO PERSON, IMPLEMENTING A FERVENT AND OVERWHELMING DYNAMIC CAPABLE OF CHANGING CHILE ON 14 DECEMBER 1989. OUR PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS PLAYED AN OUTSTANDING ROLE IN THE CRUCIAL CROSSROADS OF THE 20TH CENTURY. THEY ARE PLAYING IT NOW, FIGHTING WHOLEHEARTEDLY, CONVINCED THAT THE VICTORY OF DEMOCRACY WILL REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARD RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS, AN EMPHATIC AND RIGHTEOUS NO TO IMPUNITY, AND A SUBSTANTIVE YES TO LIBERTY FOR ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS AND TO THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CNI . THE OUTSTANDING COMMUNIST LEADER AND INTELLECTUAL SAID THAT THESE ARE DAYS FOR GENEROSITY AND SPIRITUAL GRANDEUR. SEEKING DEMOCRACY, WE ARE SHAKING HANDS WITH ALL THOSE WITH WHOM WE HAVE HAD DISAGREEMENTS IN THE PAST. WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE THIS. ALTHOUGH WE ARE MOTIVATED BY DIFFERENT POLITICAL CONCEPTS, THIS IS A CREATIVE TIME FOR A COMMON DENOMINATOR, JOINT ACTIONS, AND FOR EVERYONE TO LEND A HAND. IF THE OPPOSITION MARCHES UNITED TOWARD 14 DECEMBER, IT WILL ACHIEVE A OVERWHELMING VICTORY THAT WILL BE REGISTERED IN CHILEAN HISTORY AS A GOLDEN DATE OF EXTRAORDINARY SIGNIFICANCE. SUCH A VICTORY WILL FINALLY RESTORE A RIGHT THAT HAS REPEATEDLY BEEN REQUESTED AND VIOLATED: THE RIGHT TO REJOICE AND TO TRUST IN THE FUTURE WITH THE CERTAINTY THAT NO ONE WILL SLIP UNNOTICED THROUGH THE SHADOWS OF THE NIGHT TO KILL A CHILEAN WITH IMPUNITY. THE PEOPLE, ADDED VOLODIA TEITELBOIM, ARE BEGINNING TO PAINT THE WALLS WITH A SLOGAN: THE PEOPLE WIN, THE DICTATORSHIP IS OVER. THE DICTATORSHIP WILL END AND THE PEOPLE WILL WIN. IF WE WIN IN 14 DECEMBER AND DOUBTLESSLY WE WILL, AND IF WE -- ALWAYS ACTING IN UNISON -- IMMEDIATELY SPOIL PINOCHET'S PLANS, WE WILL THEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE PRESIDENT OR THE PERPETUAL BOSS. THE TOP LEADER OF CHILEAN COMMUNISTS WARNED THAT THE DANGERS AND DIFFICULTIES DEMAND THAT WE REMAIN ALERT AND WORK EVEN HARDER. WE MUST BURY ALL ATTEMPTS BY THE GENERAL AND HIS FAITHFULS TO STOP OR REVERSE CHILE'S PROGRESS TOWARD NEW HORIZONS. VOLODIA TEITELBOIM POINTED OUT THAT PATRICIO AYLWIN, DURING A MEETING AT THE OPENING CEREMONY FOR THE CHRISTIAN LEFT PARTY OFFICES, EXPRESSED HIS DESIRE TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT A TRULY DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT THAT WILL MAKE ALL CHILEANS ACTIVE AGAIN IN DEMOCRATIC LIFE. THIS PURPOSE REFLECTS THE SENTIMENTS OF A VAST MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO TURN THE BLOODY PAGE OF THE DICTATORSHIP AND PUT AN END TO POLITICAL AND SOCIAL NEGLECT AND TO THE DIVISIONS BETWEEN HUMANS, BETWEEN PARIAHS AND PRIVILEGED ONES, AND BETWEEN FIRST-CLASS, SECOND-CLASS, OR THIRD-CLASS PEOPLE, WHERE SOME ENJOY EVERY RIGHT WHILE OTHERS ARE DENIED EVEN THE RIGHT TO LIVE. IN HIS SPEECH OVER A PARTIAL RADIO NETWORK, THE PCCH SECRETARY GENERAL SAID: WE DREAM ABOUT AND STRIVE FOR A CHILE WITHOUT MISSING PEOPLE, WITHOUT EXECUTED PEOPLE, WITHOUT BURNED YOUTHS, WITHOUT POLITICAL PRISONERS, WITHOUT EXILES -- A FATHERLAND OF EQUALS AMONG EQUALS.
DEV-MUC3-0422	BOGOTA, 4 SEP 89 -- OFFICIALS FROM COLOMBIA'S AVIANCA AIRLINE DENIED REPORTS TODAY THAT A BOMB HAD BEEN FOUND AND DEFUSED INSIDE ONE OF ITS AIRPLANES IN THE CITY OF MEDELLIN. THIS REPORT IS RELATED TO THE "WAR" THAT THE DRUGTRAFFICKING MAFIA HAS DECLARED ON THE COUNTRY, A WAR THAT HAS BEEN INTENSIFIED IN RECENT HOURS. ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, POLICE ANTI-EXPLOSIVE EXPERTS DEFUSED A POWERFUL CHARGE OF DYNAMITE FOUND IN AN AVIANCA 727 PLANE THAT ARRIVED IN MEDELLIN FROM PEREIRA WITH 180 PASSENGERS ABOARD. THE REPORT, BROADCAST BY A TELEVISION NEWS PROGRAM AFTER HAVING BEEN CONFIRMED BY A CIVIL AERONAUTICS OFFICIAL, STATED THAT THE BOMB WAS FOUND BY THE PLANE'S CREW MEMBERS AFTER THEY DETECTED A HEAVY SMELL OF POWDER SHORTLY AFTER LANDING. THIS SITUATION, WHICH HAS BEEN BLAMED ON THE "NERVOUSNESS" THE COUNTRY IS EXPERIENCING, TOOK PLACE ONLY A FEW HOURS AFTER A MAN DRESSED IN A CAMOUFLAGE MILITARY UNIFORM KILLED 1 PERSON AND WOUNDED 13 OTHERS WITH A MACHINEGUN AT MEDELLIN'S JOSE MARIA CORDOBA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. THE KILLER, WHOSE POSSIBLE TIES WITH DRUG-TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS ARE BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE AUTHORITIES, FIRED INDISCRIMINATELY ON PEOPLE WAITING IN LINE FOR THEIR TICKETS TO BOGOTA, ACCORDING TO WITNESSES.
DEV-MUC3-0423	MEDELLIN, 4 SEP 89 -- A NEW TERRORIST ACTION SHOOK MEDELLIN IN NORTHWESTERN COLOMBIA THIS EVENING WHEN TWO MEN RIDING ON A MOTORCYCLE THREW AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE AT A POLICE POST LOCATED IN THE EXCLUSIVE SUBURB OF EL POBLADO. MIRACULOUSLY, THE THREE POLICEMEN AND TWO CIVILIANS WHO WERE INSIDE ESCAPED INJURY. THE POST, KNOWN AS AN IMMEDIATE ATTENTION CENTER , WHICH PLAYS THE ROLE OF A POLICE CONTROL POST, WAS DESTROYED BY THE EXPLOSION OF THE DEVICE. THREE POLICEMEN AND TWO CIVILIANS WERE INSIDE THE POST, WHICH WAS NOT FULLY OPERATIONAL BECAUSE IT HAD NOT BEEN COMPLETELY BUILT, BUT MANAGED TO ESCAPE. ONE OF THE POLICEMEN TOLD AFP THAT THEY SAW TWO MEN ON A MOTORCYCLE SWIFTLY PASSING BY THE CAI AND THEN THROWING A RED PLASTIC BAG. THE THREE POLICEMEN AND THE TWO CIVILIANS MANAGED TO RUN A FEW METERS DOWN THE STREET BEFORE THE DEVICE EXPLODED. ALTHOUGH THE DEVICE'S POWER HAS YET TO BE ESTABLISHED BY EXPERTS, THE DETONATION WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO DESTROY THE STRUCTURE, MEASURING APPROXIMATELY 11 SQUARE METERS. PRECISELY 1 MONTH AGO THE SAME CAI HAD BEEN DESTROYED WHEN ITS WALLS WERE BEING CONSTRUCTED. A WOMAN WHO PASSED THROUGH THE AREA AT THE TIME OF THE ATTACK WAS NOT INJURED EITHER, EVEN THOUGH HER VEHICLE SUSTAINED CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE, PARTICULARLY THE WINDOWS, WHICH WERE DESTROYED. THE NEW TERRORIST ACTION OCCURRED 12 HOURS AFTER A MAN WAS INVOLVED IN A SPECTACULAR SHOOT-OUT AT THE JOSE MARIA CORDOBA AIRPORT IN MEDELLIN, WHERE THE GUNMAN AND A YOUNG MAN DIED AND 10 PERSONS WERE WOUNDED, INCLUDING THREE POLICEMEN. THE CAI'S DESTRUCTION OCCURRED 4 HOURS AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE CURFEW, IMPOSED BY MAYOR JUAN GOMEZ MARTINEZ 6 DAYS AGO IN AN ATTEMPT TO CURTAIL THE TERRORIST ACTIONS WHICH HAVE SHAKEN THE CITY, BIRTHPLACE OF THE MEDELLIN DRUG CARTEL.
DEV-MUC3-0424	BOGOTA, 5 SEP 89 -- THE DEFENSE MINISTRY HAS REPORTED THAT A GROUP OF UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS TODAY KILLED ANGELA DE GUERRERO, WIFE OF COLONEL CARLOS GUERRERO OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL COMMAND, IN NORTHERN BOGOTA. ACCORDING TO A MILITARY REPORT, ANGELA DE GUERRERO WAS WAITING FOR A RELATIVE IN FRONT OF A SUPERMARKET WHEN SHE WAS SHOT FROM A MOVING VEHICLE. A POLICE OPERATION IS NOW BEING CARRIED OUT IN SEARCH OF THE CRIMINALS.
DEV-MUC3-0425	SANTIAGO, 5 SEP 89 -- POLICE SOURCES HAVE CONFIRMED THAT JECAR ANTONIO NEGHME CRISTI, 28, POLITICAL LEADER OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY LEFT, MIR, DIED INSTANTLY LAST NIGHT WHEN HE WAS HIT BY 12 BULLETS FIRED FROM 2 DIFFERENT WEAPONS IN AN ATTACK THAT OCCURED WHILE HE WAS WALKING HOME FROM HIS PARTY OFFICE. SOME DOCUMENTS WERE FOUND AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME. ONE OF THE LEAFLETS FOUND STATED: KILLED FOR BETRAYING THE REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE AND THE PEOPLE. YELLOW AND BOURGEOIS . ACCORDING TO THE INVESTIGATORS, NEGHME'S BODY RECEIVED 18 BULLET WOUNDS, CAUSED BY 12 DIRECT HITS. THE ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT BY A GROUP OF ARMED INDIVIDUALS IN A MOVING CAR. NOTHING IS KNOWN ABOUT THE ATTACKERS. CARABINEROS PERSONNEL WENT TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME AFTER RECEIVING A TELEPHONE CALL. HOMICIDE EXPERTS FROM THE CIVILIAN POLICE ARRIVED A LITTLE LATER. THEY IMMEDIATELY CONDUCTED THE APPROPRIATE INVESTIGATIONS WHERE THE MIR SPOKESMAN WAS GUNNED DOWN. NEGHME WAS KILLED SOME 50 METERS FROM THE BERNARDO O'HIGGINS PROMENADE, AT 10 WEST BULNES STREET. THE STREET IS POORLY ILLUMINATED. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE NO EYEWITNESSES OF THE CRIME. ACCORDING TO POLICE SOURCES, TWO AUTOMATIC WEAPONS WERE USED; ONE A 7.65-MM AND THE OTHER A 9-MM. THE POLICE ADDED THAT NEGHME WAS NOT CARRYING A WEAPON. A BRIEFCASE FOUND NEAR HIS BODY CONTAINED SOME SPEECHES AND A BOOK ON CHILEAN HISTORY.
DEV-MUC3-0426	SAN SALVADOR, 5 SEP 89 -- A SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT COMMISSION WILL MEET WITH LEFTIST REBELS BEFORE 15 SEPTEMBER IN A PRELIMINARY DIALOGUE TO END ALMOST 10 YEARS OF CIVIL WAR, IT WAS REPORTED TODAY BY A HIGH-RANKING OFFICIAL. PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI WILL ANNOUNCE ON 7 SEPTEMBER THE CREATION OF A COMMISSION AND THE DATE AND PLACE OF THE TALKS WITH THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT REPRESENTATIVES, IT WAS STATED BY COMMUNICATIONS MINISTER MAURICIO SANDOVAL. "THE MEETING WILL BE HELD BEFORE 15 SEPTEMBER," SANDOVAL TOLD REUTER. SANDOVAL'S STATEMENTS WERE GIVEN AFTER FMLN COMMANDER ANA GUADALUPE MARTINEZ SAID TODAY IN MEXICO CITY THAT THE REBELS HAD ACCEPTED A GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL TO HOLD TALKS BEFORE 15 SEPTEMBER, THE ANNIVERSARY OF EL SALVADOR'S INDEPENDENCE. "WE THINK THAT THE MEETING COULD BE HELD IN MEXICO CITY, AND ON 7 SEPTEMBER WE WILL ANNOUNCE A SERIES OF MEASURES TO FACILITATE THE DIALOGUE" -- THE FIRST BETWEEN CRISTIANI'S RIGHT-WING GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN, MARTINEZ SAID IN A NEWS CONFERENCE. SHE DID NOT RULE OUT THE DECLARATION OF AN UNILATERAL CEASE-FIRE. "PERHAPS YES, PERHAPS NO," MARTINEZ ANSWERED WHEN ASKED ABOUT IT. SANDOVAL SAID THAT THE TALKS COULD BE HELD IN COSTA RICA OR MEXICO. "IT IS ALMOST SURE THAT THE TALKS WILL BE HELD IN MEXICO," HE SAID. SANDOVAL SAID THAT THE PROGRESS ACHIEVED TOWARD THE TALKS WAS PROOF OF THE PLEDGE ASSUMED BY THE GOVERNMENT WHICH WAS SWORN IN ON 1 JUNE TO SOLVE A CONFLICT WHICH HAS COST EL SALVADOR MORE THAN 70,000 LIVES. "SPECIFIC STEPS ARE BEING TAKEN IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE," HE SAID. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE EMPHASIZED THAT THE FIRST ROUND OF TALKS WILL PROBABLY PREPARE THE GROUNDWORK FOR FUTURE, MORE SUBSTANTIAL, TALKS. SANDOVAL DID NOT SAY WHO WOULD COMPRISE THE GOVERNMENT'S DIALOGUE COMMISSION BUT OFFICIALS HAD PREVIOUSLY SAID THAT THE ARMED FORCES AND THE CHURCH WOULD NOT BE REPRESENTED -- A PREVIOUS FMLN DEMAND. "WE ACCEPT THAT THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION THAT WILL ATTEND THE DIALOGUE BE COMPOSED AS THE GOVERNMENT WANTS," COMMANDER MARTINEZ SAID TODAY. "WE BELIEVE IT IS NEGATIVE FOR THE ARMY NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN A DIALOGUE WHERE THE WAR WILL BE DISCUSSED. IT WILL BE A MISTAKE FOR THE MILITARY NOT TO ATTEND THE MEETING." VICE PRESIDENT FRANCISCO MERINO TOLD REPORTERS ON 4 SEPTEMBER THAT THE ARMED FORCES -- AND THE OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES -- WOULD BE INCLUDED IN WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS A "SUPPORT COMMISSION" THAT WOULD PLAY AN ADVISORY ROLE IN THE TALKS. THREE ROUNDS OF TALKS BETWEEN THE FMLN AND PRESIDENT JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE'S CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT, WHICH CONCLUDED ITS TERM ON 1 JUNE, FAILED TO ACHIEVE PROGRESS TOWARD THE SOLUTION OF A CIVIL WAR. TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT OF A PEACE DIALOGUE OCCURRED AMID FIERCE CLASHES BETWEEN GOVERNMENT TROOPS AND REBELS IN SEVERAL PARTS OF EL SALVADOR. A MAJOR CLASH OCCURRED IN EASTERN MORAZAN DEPARTMENT, WHERE THE REBELS KILLED 14 SOLDIERS AND 2 OFFICERS. THE ARMED FORCES ALSO SAID THEY HAD CAUSED "NUMEROUS" REBEL CASUALTIES DURING A CLASH WHICH OCCURRED NEAR CHILANGA, BUT THEY FAILED TO PROVIDE EXACT FIGURES.
DEV-MUC3-0427	SAN SALVADOR, 4 SEP 89 -- COLONEL ORLANDO MONTANO, DEPUTY MINISTER OF DEFENSE AND PUBLIC SECURITY, GAVE ASSURANCES TODAY THAT THE ARMED FORCES WILL ESTABLISH A TRUCE ON 14 AND 15 SEPTEMBER, AS REQUESTED BY THE PERMANENT DIALOGUE COMMITTEE, AND THE FMLN HAS PLEDGED TO RESPECT IT. THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSAL IS A GOOD ONE AND THE ARMED FORCES APPLAUDS IT, AND IS IN A POSITION TO ACCEPT IT, AS LONG AS THE FMLN ALSO COMPLIES WITH IT. SPEAKING AT A NEWS CONFERENCE, COL MONTANO SAID THAT THE MAIMED FMLN FIGHTERS' PRESENCE AT THE METROPOLITAN CATHEDRAL IS AN INDICATION THAT FMLN LEADERS ABANDON THEIR FIGHTERS WHEN THEY CEASE TO BE USEFUL. I BELIEVE THAT IF THE FMLN WANTED TO SEND THOSE PEOPLE ABROAD, AS THEY HAVE DONE IN THE PAST, THEY COULD VERY WELL HAVE DONE SO. THEY HAVE THE FIGHTERS AT THE CATHEDRAL FOR PROPAGANDA PURPOSES, AND TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS INHUMANE. I HAVE EVEN READ AND HEARD STATEMENTS BY FMLN ALLIES WHO SAY THAT THE SITUATION OF THE MAIMED CANNOT BE NEGOTIATED FOR HUMANITARIAN REASONS. HOWEVER, DID THEY DISPLAY HUMANENESS WHEN THEY BURNED BUSES, LEFT THE PEOPLE WITHOUT ELECTRICITY, OR DESTROYED SO MANY THINGS THAT BENEFIT THE PUBLIC? REFERRING TO THE HOMILY DELIVERED YESTERDAY BY MONSIGNOR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, WHO ACCUSED THE AIR FORCE OF BOMBING THE SANTA ELENA CHURCH IN USULUTAN DEPARTMENT, COL MONTANO SAID THAT SOME LEFTIST CLERGYMEN DISTORT THE FACTS FOR PROPAGANDA PURPOSES. WITH THEIR HUMANITARIAN IMAGE, THEY OFTEN OPPOSE THE SEARCH FOR PEACE, THEY OPPOSE THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIZATION AND, IN FACT, THEY OFTEN PLAY UP TO THE FMLN. IN REALITY THEIR ATTACKS AND DISPARAGING REMARKS ABOUT THE ARMED FORCES ARE UNFAIR. THEY BLAME THE ARMY FOR THINGS IT IS NOT GUILTY OF OR RESPONSIBLE FOR. TO CONCLUDE, THE MILITARY OFFICER SAID THE ARMY IS CARRYING OUT AN OPERATION TO ENSURE SAFETY DURING THE INDEPENDENCE FESTIVITIES.
DEV-MUC3-0428	BOGOTA, 5 SEP 89 -- PUBLIC ORDER JUDGES WILL BEGIN WORKING OUT OF THE DAS HEADQUARTERS. THIS IS PART OF THE PROTECTIVE MEASURES THE AUTHORITIES ARE IMPLEMENTING TO PREVENT COLOMBIAN JUDGES FROM BEING MURDERED. FURTHERMORE, SECURITY MEASURES AT COURT ENTRANCES CAN BE NOTED, EVEN SUCH IMPLAUSIBLE MEASURES AS THIS: ALL PEOPLE WHO BEAR WEAPONS MUST TURN THEM IN AT THE ENTRANCE IN EXCHANGE FOR A PIECE OF CARDBOARD. ALL THESE WEAPONS BELONG TO PEOPLE VISITING THE PALO QUEMADO COURTS. ON SOME DAYS, THERE CAN BE AS MANY AS 100 DIFFERENT CALIBER WEAPONS LYING ON THE TABLE. THEY ARE IDENTIFIED BY SIMPLE, EASILY FORGED PIECES OF CARDBOARD. THIS IS ONE OF THE SECURITY MEASURES USED TO PROTECT JUDGES WORKING HERE. ARMED POLICEMEN CARRY OUT BODY SEARCHES ON VISITORS AND CHECK OUT THE SURROUNDING AREAS, BUT THE JUDGES ARE STILL NERVOUS. JUDGES WITH THE MOST RESPONSIBILITIES -- PUBLIC ORDER JUDGES -- YEARN FOR SEVERE RESTRICTIONS SUCH AS THOSE THAT PROTECT ITALIAN JUDGES, WHO CONVENE IN SECURE BUNKERS THAT PROTECT THEM FROM DANGER, BOTH TO THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. LACKING THOSE FACILITIES, COLOMBIAN JUDGES HAVE ACCEPTED THE OFFER MADE BY THE DAS DIRECTOR. PUBLIC ORDER JUDGES ARE GOING TO WORK OUT OF THE DAS OFFICES. DO YOU KNOW WHEN? BEGINNING NEXT WEEK, I BELIEVE.
DEV-MUC3-0429	SAN SALVADOR, 5 SEP 89 -- THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AFFIRMED TODAY THAT MANY OF THE SALVADORAN REFUGEES IN HONDURAS ARE LINKED TO THE GUERRILLAS BUT THAT HE WILL MAKE A "GOOD WILL" GESTURE TO HAVE APPROXIMATELY 3,800 OF THEM REPATRIATED. "THE GOVERNMENT IS MAKING A GOOD WILL GESTURE BY ACCEPTING THE REPATRIATION OF THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS WHILE KNOWING THAT MANY OF THEM ARE RELATIVES OF CRIMINAL TERRORISTS , SAID SALVADORAN VICE PRESIDENT AND INTERIOR MINISTER FRANCISCO MERINO. THE GOVERNMENTS OF EL SALVADOR AND HONDURAS AND THE UN HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES ARE PREPARING THE RETURN OF THESE SALVADORANS WHO FLED TO HONDURAS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DECADE TO ESCAPE FROM THE ARMED CONFLICT. MERINO STATED: "WE WANT THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT THERE WAS A JUSTIFICATION FOR RESORTING TO VIOLENCE, NOW, 10 YEARS LATER, THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION AT ALL AND THE MOMENT HAS COME FOR BEGINNING A NORMAL LIFE." ACCORDING TO THE VICE PRESIDENT, THE FACT THAT THERE ARE NO MALES AMONG THESE REFUGEES IS EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE LINKS WITH THE GUERRILLAS. ALTHOUGH WE DID NOT FIND MEN OF OVER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THERE WERE MANY PREGNANT WOMEN," MERINO TOLD THE PRESS. THE GOVERNMENT SELECTED SETTLEMENT AREAS FOR THE REPATRIATED, WHERE IT WILL GIVE THEM MEDICAL AND EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND A FUNCTIONING INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR THEIR PART, THE REFUGEES HAVE ASKED TO BE ALLOWED TO RETURN TO THEIR PLACES OF ORIGIN, IN WAR-TORN AREAS IN THE NORTHERN PART OF CHALATENANGO, SAN MIGUEL, AND MORAZAN DEPARTMENTS, OR IN LA UNION DEPARTMENT. "TO SEND THEM THERE," MERINO SAID, "WOULD BE TO CONDEMN THEM TO PERMANENT UNDERDEVELOPMENT. THEY WANT TO RETURN TO PLACES THAT DO NOT PROVIDE WHAT IS NEEDED FOR DEVELOPMENT OR FOR A NORMAL LIFE." THE CHRISTIAN COMMITTEE FOR DISPLACED SALVADORANS, WHICH CLAIMS TO REPRESENT THE REFUGEES, HAS ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF WANTING TO SEND THE REPATRIATED TO "CONCENTRATION CAMPS GUARDED BY THE ARMED FORCES."
DEV-MUC3-0430	CARACAS , 5 SEP 89 -- THE EXTENSIVE BORDER SHARED BY VENEZUELA AND COLOMBIA IS TODAY, MORE THAN EVER, THE CAUSE OF CONCERN FOR THE CARACAS GOVERNMENT. THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING ORDERED BY PRESIDENT BARCO IS VIEWED BY LOCAL COMMENTATORS AS A DANGEROUS THREAT TO VENEZUELA DUE TO ITS PROXIMITY TO COLOMBIA, WITH WHOM VENEZUELA SHARES OVER 2,000 KM. THE BORDER WITH COLOMBIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CAUSE OF CONCERN FOR VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENTS. ON SEVERAL OCASSIONS VENEZUELA HAD TO FACE RAIDS INTO ITS TERRITORY, AS WELL AS THE KIDNAPPING OF STOCKBREEDERS, SMUGGLING OF GOODS, AND DRUG TRAFFICKING BY COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS AND CRIMINALS. THE WAR DECLARED BY THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT ON THE MEDELLIN CARTEL OPENS UP THE POSSIBILITY THAT MANY OF THE DRUG CHIEFTAINS, AND PERHAPS SOME DRUG KINGPINS, MAY SEEK REFUGE IN VENEZUELAN TERRITORY. VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ WARNED THAT IF DRUG TRAFFICKERS ATTEMPT TO TRANSFER THEIR INDUSTRIES TO VENEZUELA THEY WILL HAVE TO "FACE VENEZUELAN JUSTICE, AND CERTAINLY EXTRADITION TRIALS." THE STATES OF ZULIA, TACHIRA, AND APURE --IN WESTERN VENEZUELA -- BORDER COLOMBIAN TERRITORY AND HAVE BEEN THE SCENE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING OPERATIONS MANY TIMES. IN THE PAST FEW DAYS VENEZUELAN SECURITY FORCES HAVE INCREASED VIGILANCE AT THE MAIN BORDER POSTS BECAUSE OF RUMORS THAT DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE BEGUN MOVING TO VENEZUELA. GOVERNOR OF ZULIA STATE ISMAEL ORDAZ CONFIRMED TO NEWSMEN THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS INTENSIFIED CONTROL AND VIGILANCE MEASURES AT THE BORDER WITH COLOMBIA. HE NOTED THERE IS BROAD COOPERATION BETWEEN THE VENEZUELAN AND COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING. DURING A RADIO PROGRAM ON MONDAY, 4 SEPTEMBER, JOURNALIST JOSE VICENTE RANGEL, FORMER MOVEMENT TOWARD SOCIALISM PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, MAINTAINED THAT IT IS NOT AT THIS TIME THAT DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARE ATTEMPTING TO ENTER VENEZUELA BECAUSE THEY ENTERED A LONG TIME AGO. RANGEL MAINTAINED THAT VENEZUELA ANNUALLY SERVES AS A BRIDGE FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING WORTH SOME $20 BILLION. FURTHERMORE, HE SAID, THE EXPENSIVE VENEZUELAN ELECTORAL CAMPAIGNS HAVE ALSO RECEIVED RESOURCES OBTAINED FROM DRUG TRAFFICKING. THE FIGURES GIVEN BY RANGEL ARE EQUIVALENT TO 66 PERCENT OF THE VENEZUELAN FOREIGN DEBT, WHICH AMOUNTS TO SOME $30 MILLION THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY TRYING TO RENEGOTIATE. MOREOVER, RANGEL SAID, DURING THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN THAT CONCLUDED WITH THE ELECTION OF CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ IN DECEMBER 1988, POLITICAL PARTIES INVESTED SOME 5 BILLION BOLIVARES IN PROPAGANDA. THIS FIGURE IS EXCESSIVE IF ONE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THAT, AS ESTABLISHED BY THE LAW, THE STATE ONLY CONTRIBUTES 100 MILLION BOLIVARES FOR THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGNS HELD EVERY 5 YEARS. RANGEL ADDED THAT THE POSSIBLE TRANSFER OF COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKING OPERATION CENTERS TO VENEZUELA IS VERY WORRYING IF ONE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THAT VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE OPENLY ADMITTED THE LACK OF VIGILANCE AT THE BORDERS. HOWEVER, WHILE COLOMBIA IS ATTEMPTING, PERHAPS BELATEDLY, NOT TO YIELD TO THE ECONOMIC POWER AND VIOLENCE OF DRUGS, THERE SEEMS TO BE NO AWARENESS IN VENEZUELA ABOUT THE GRAVE DANGER POSED BY THE ALLEGED CHANGE OF ADDRESS WHICH, ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS, IS BEING PLANNED BY COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS.
DEV-MUC3-0431	LIMA, NO DATE -- IT IS CLEAR THAT NEO-LIBERALISM IS THE IDEOLOGY OF THE NORTH. IF IN THE PAST LIBERALISM WAS A FACTOR THAT PROMOTED PROGRESS AND INDEPENDENCE IN LATIN AMERICA, NEO- LIBERALISM IS NOW THE STATE IDEOLOGY OF THE MORE POWERFUL NATIONS. IT IS AN AUTHORITARIAN IDEOLOGY THAT DOES NOT QUESTION ALL TYPES OF STATES, BUT ONLY THE STATES OF THE SOUTH. UNDER THE GUISE OF ELIMINATING BUREAUCRACY AND PROMOTING EFFICIENCY, NEO-LIBERALISM WANTS TO DESTROY THE STATE TO ELIMINATE ANY RESISTANCE TO THE HEGEMONY OF THE WORLD MARKET. WE SHOULD NOT PLAY THAT GAME. IDEOLOGICAL NONALIGNMENT SHOULD THEREFORE REDEFINE THE STATE AND DEFEND ITS STRENGTH IN OUR COUNTRIES. WHEN I SAY STATE I AM NOT REFERRING MERELY TO THE INDIVIDUAL STATES THAT EVERY ONE OF US REPRESENTS. I AM REFERRING TO AN ACCORD THAT OUR STATES SHOULD REACH IN EACH REGION. WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE UNITED IN CONTINENTAL BLOCS. WE MUST PROMOTE OUR REGIONAL ECONOMY. ONLY THROUGH REGIONAL INITIATIVES WILL WE HAVE POWER IN THE CURRENT PROCESS OF RESTRUCTURING THE MARKET. IT IS THEREFORE IMPERATIVE TO CALL -- IN EACH CONTINENT -- MORE FREQUENT AND REGULAR MEETINGS OF OUR MOVEMENT. WE MUST ORGANIZE THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT ON A CONTINENTAL BASIS TO STRENGTHEN IT IN ALL PLACES. MANY HAVE COME TO THIS MEETING TO PROPOSE AN ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE FOR OUR MOVEMENT TO INSURE ITS CONTINUITY. THIS CAN BE VIEWED AS A SUGGESTION. IT IS A LOT MORE IMPORTANT, THOUGH, TO RECOGNIZE THE EXISTENCE OF REGIONAL DIFFERENCES AND TO CREATE INTERMEDIATE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT ORGANIZATIONS WHEREVER POSSIBLE. THESE INTERMEDIATE ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD STRENGTHEN THE PRINCIPLES OF THE MOVEMENT IN EACH REGION, THUS EXPANDING ITS POWER. ALTHOUGH IT'S TAKEN SOMETIME, I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED THIS APPROACH IN LATIN AMERICA THROUGH THE CREATION OF THE POLITICAL CONSULTATION MECHANISM OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT, WHICH GIVES COMMON ANSWERS TO THE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND TO POLITICAL INTERVENTION. MR PRESIDENT, IN HONORING OUR FOUNDERS -- TITO, NEHRU, AND NASSER -- I SHOULD STRESS THE ETHICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF NONALIGNMENT. WITHOUT THE POWER OF NUCLEAR BOMBS OR MONEY, WE HAVE UPHELD THE MORAL VALUES OF MANKIND TO HELP IT TO CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE IN ALL FIELDS. THEREFORE, OUR MOVEMENT CANNOT REMAIN INDIFFERENT TO THE VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING AND DRUG ADDICTION, WHICH HAS SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD. IT IS TRUE THAT THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS RICH COUNTRIES, BECAUSE DRUG ADDICTION REFLECTS THE MOST REFINED STAGE OF CONSUMPTION, THE CONSUMPTION OF INSATISFACTION. YET IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT WE, AS DRUG PRODUCERS OR DEALERS, ARE INVOLUNTARY PARTNERS. LIKE NEO- LIBERALISM, DRUG TRAFFICKING HAS PERVERSELY TRIED TO TAKE OVER. DRUG TRAFFICKING IS ALSO A FORM OF HEGEMONY BY THE LARGE RICH MARKETS, WHICH ARE THEREBY DISTORTING AND CORRUPTING OUR SOCIETY. DRUG TRAFFICKING ALSO SEEKS TO DESTROY STATES, AS IT IS NOW DOING IN COLOMBIA. I BELIEVE WE SHOULD RAISE THE BANNER OF MANKIND'S MORAL VALUES; WE SHOULD TELL THE RICH THAT EVEN IF THEY IGNORE OUR CLAIMS FOR JUSTICE, WE WILL NOT IGNORE THEIR YOUTH AND THEIR CHILDREN, WHO MUST BE DEFENDED FROM DRUG ADDICTION. THE U.S. PRESIDENT WILL FORMULATE A PROPOSAL ON THE SUBJECT TOMORROW, AND WE HOPE IT WILL BE AN ALL-ENCOMPASSING PROPOSAL. THE PROBLEM IS NOT JUST OVER HELICOPTERS AN AMMUNITION. IT INVOLVES AN ACCORD BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE, ON ONE SIDE, AND THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE DIRECTLY INVOLVED ON THE OTHER. THE PRODUCTION OF DRUGS, IN PARTICULAR, CALLS FOR STRUCTURAL TREATMENT, WITHOUT WHICH ANY MILITARY AID WILL BE INSUFFICIENT. OUR MOVEMENT MUST ADOPT A STRONG STAND AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING AND UNDERTAKE JOINT MEASURES TO ERADICATE IT. THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT MUST ALSO ADOPT A STRONG STAND AGAINST TERRORISM, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT IS LINKED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING, AS IN PERU. FAITHFUL TO ITS MORAL PRINCIPLES, THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT SHOULD STRONGLY REJECT DRUG ADDICTION AND DEATH. THIS WILL SHOW THAT OUR NATIONS' RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY IS AS STRONG AS THAT OF THE MOST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. MR PRESIDENT: WE CAME TO THIS SUMMIT FROM PERU TO REITERATE OUR FAITH IN NONALIGNMENT, OUR ANTI-IMPERIALIST POSITION AGAINST COLONIALISM AND INTERVENTIONISM, AND OUR DECISION TO SIDE WITH THE NATIONS STRUGGLING FOR FREEDOM AND JUSTICE. WE CAME TO DEFEND IDEOLOGICAL NONALIGNMENT. WE CAME TO DEMAND FINANCIAL DISARMAMENT AND THE RECOGNITION OF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE DEBT. WE ARE HERE TO REITERATE OUR ALLEGIANCE TO THE IMMORTAL PRINCIPLES THAT WE UNITED BEHIND 28 YEARS AGO. I SALUTE THE NATIONS OF THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
DEV-MUC3-0432	MEDELLIN, 5 SEP 89 -- A RADIO STATION NEWSMAN HAS REPORTED THAT AN ALLEGED SPOKESMAN FOR "THE EXTRADITABLES," A GROUP THAT CLAIMS TO BE LINKED TO THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE BURNING OF A RESTAURANT TODAY AND A 5 SEPTEMBER SHARPSHOOTER ATTACK AT THE LOCAL AIRPORT. A NEWSMAN FROM RADIO CARACOL OF MEDELLIN REPORTED RECEIVING A TELEPHONE CALL FROM A MEMBER OF THE EXTRADITABLES CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE BURNING OF A COUNTRYSIDE RESTRAURANT. THE CALLER JUSTIFIED THIS ACTION BY SAYING THAT THE RESTARANTS' OWNERS PAID HOMAGE TO A MILITARY LEADER. MEDELLIN, WHICH IS THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS' TRADING HEADQUARTERS IN COLOMBIA, WAS HIT BY A WAVE OF THREATS THAT TURNED OUT TO BE NOTHING BUT FALSE ALARMS THAT NEVERTHELESS PROMPTED THE POLICE TO CONSTANTLY PATROL THE CITY AND EVACUATE SHOPPING CENTERS IN SEARCH OF NONEXISTENT BOMBS. WORKERS SAID THAT THE RESTAURANT, WHOSE OWNER WAS A FOLLOWER OF RECENTLY ASSASSINATED PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LUIS CARLOS GALAN, WAS TORCHED BY RIFLE-TOTING YOUTHS. THEY LOCKED FOUR WORKERS IN AN OFFICE UNTIL THE FIRE STARTED. THE RESTAURANT SUFFERED 20 MILLION PESOS IN LOSES. HE ALSO SAID THAT THE EXTRADITABLES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR AN ATTACK ON 5 SEPTEMBER IN WHICH A MAN DRESSED IN COMBAT GEAR FIRED AN AUTOMATIC RIFLE AT INDUSTRIALISTS AND BUSINESSMEN AT THE MEDELLIN AIRPORT. THE SHARPSHOOTER, WHO WAS SHOT BY POLICEMEN, MANAGED TO KILL 1 PERSON AND WOUND 12 OTHERS. THE ANONYMOUS CALLER GAVE NO EXPLANATION FOR THE ATTACK, A CARACOL NEWSMAN TOLD REUTER. TWO WEEKS AGO THE EXTRADITABLES DECLARED "TOTAL WAR" AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO AFTER HE LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN TO REPRESS THE DRUG BARONS IN WHICH 11,000 INDIVIDUALS WERE ARRESTED AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROPERTY OWNED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE CONFISCATED.
DEV-MUC3-0433	BOGOTA, 6 SEP 89 -- THE POLICE REPORTED TODAY THAT U.S. JOURNALIST BERNARDETTE PARDO, WHO WAS SENT TO COLOMBIA BY THE SPANISH-SPEAKING UNIVISION TELEVISION NETWORK TO COVER THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT'S "WAR" AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WAS INJURED LAST NIGHT DURING AN ATTACK IN MEDELLILN. IT WAS LEARNED THAT PARDO WAS IN A RESTAURANT IN MEDELLIN ACCOMPANIED BY CAMERAMAN CARLOS CORRALES AND COLOMBIAN MOVIE ACTOR JORGE SAENZ WHEN A MEDIUM-INTENSITY BOMB EXPLODED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT. PARDO, OF CUBAN ORIGIN, SUFFERED FRACTURES IN HER CLAVICLE AND RIGHT SHOULDER BLADE AND WOUNDS IN HER NECK. SHE IS CURRENTLY AT A HOSPITAL IN MEDELLIN. CORRALES WAS INJURED BY SPLINTERS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF HIS BODY. THE POLICE REPORTED THAT THE ATTACK WAS APPARENTLY CARRIED OUT BY A COUPLE THAT WAS SITTING AT A TABLE CLOSE TO THE JOURNALISTS. ACCORDING TO REPORTS, A WOMAN WENT TO THE RESTROOM, THEN LEFT IN A HURRY FOLLOWED BY THE MAN, WHO WAS ACCOMPANYING HER, SHORTLY BEFORE THE EXPLOSION. ON THE NIGHT OF 3 SEPTEMBER UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS PLACED TWO BOMBS IN A PARKING LOT AND GARDEN OF A MEDELLIN HOTEL WHERE SEVERAL FOREIGN JOURNALISTS WERE STAYING. THE JOURNALISTS ARRIVED IN COLOMBIA A FEW DAYS AGO TO COVER THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE GOVERNMENT'S STRUGGLE AGAINST NARCOTICS-TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS. ALTHOUGH NO ONE WAS INJURED IN THAT INCIDENT, IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, THE LARGEST DRUG-TRAFFICKING RING IN THE WORLD, HAD DECLARED AN ALL-OUT "WAR" AGAINST FOREIGN JOURNALISTS WHO REMAIN COLOMBIA. LIKEWISE, COLOMBIAN JOURNALISTS WERE THREATENED A FEW DAYS AFTER THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFENSIVE BEGAN, IN REPRISAL FOR THE HARD BLOWS DEALT TO THE DRUG CARTEL, IN THE PAST 3 WEEKS. IN A STATEMENT FOR A FRENCH NEWSPAPER, PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, THE MEDELLIN CARTEL'S MAIN "CAPO" SAID THAT JOURNALISTS AND JUDGES "WILL PAY THE CONSEQUENCES" OF THE GOVERNMENT'S STRUGGLE, WHICH HAS RESULTED IN HUNDREDS OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARRESTED AND NUMEROUS PROPERTIES OWNED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS CONFISCATED. THE ATTACK AGAINST THE UNIVISION JOURNALISTS OCCURRED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH AN ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE POLICE IN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT -- THE CAPITAL OF WHICH IS MEDELLIN -- OF THE ARREST OF FOUR DRUG TRAFFICKERS WHOSE EXTRADITION MAY HAVE BEEN REQUESTED BY THE UNITED STATES. THE NAMES OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE NOT DISCLOSED TO THE PRESS. HOWEVER, IT WAS LEARNED THAT THEIR ARREST TOOK PLACE DURING INTENSIVE OPERATIONS WHICH TOOK PLACE IN THIS CITY DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS AS A RESULT OF WHICH 21 MERCENARIES OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL HAVE FALLEN. MEMBERS OF THE SAME NARCOTICS-TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATION DETONATED TWO BOMBS IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND SET A RESTAURANT ON FIRE IN MEDELLIN, POLICE SPOKESMEN REPORTED.
DEV-MUC3-0434	BOGOTA, 5 SEP 89 -- SPOKESMEN OF THE BOGOTA MAYOR'S OFFICE AND THE POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT CITY AUTHORITIES TODAY REINFORCED SECURITY MEASURES TO PREVENT TERRORIST ACTIONS. SECURITY PERSONNEL WERE INCREASED AT KEY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE BUILDINGS, THE ELDORADO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, AND BUS TERMINALS. AFTER A MEETING WITH THE CITY'S SECURITY COUNCIL, MAYOR ANDRES PASTRANA ISSUED A DECREE PROHIBITING ANY MEETINGS, GATHERINGS, RALLIES, OR DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE BOGOTA DISTRICT. THE DECREE, WHICH WAS ISSUED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE CURRENT STATE OF SIEGE, SETS SENTENCES OF UP TO 60 DAYS IN JAIL AND FINES OF 60,000 PESOS FOR THE ORGANIZERS OF SUCH DEMONSTRATIONS. SHORTLY AFTER THE DECREE WAS ISSUED, A TELEPHONE BOOTH IN SOUTHERN BOGOTA WAS DESTROYED BY A BOMB, POLICE REPORTED. THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES.
DEV-MUC3-0435	MOSCOW , 6 SEP 89 -- THREE STRONG EXPLOSIONS OCCURRED LAST NIGHT IN MEDELLIN, A DRUG TRAFFICKING CENTER IN COLOMBIA. AT LEAST FIVE PEOPLE, INCLUDING JOURNALISTS AND A TELEVISION CAMERA CREW, WERE WOUNDED. TWO BANK BUILDINGS AND A RESTAURANT WERE SERIOUSLY DAMAGED. THE EXPLOSIONS OCCURRED FOLLOWING THE TELEVISED SPEECH BY U.S. PRESIDENT BUSH ON HIS NEW ANTINARCOTICS PLAN.
DEV-MUC3-0436	BOGOTA, 6 SEP 89 -- COLOMBIA AND THE WORLD RECEIVED WITH OPTIMISM THE BUSH ANTIDRUG PLAN. THE U.S. PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED CONTROLS AND PUNISHMENTS FOR THOSE WHO USE DRUGS. HE ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT $8 BILLION HAS BEEN ALLOTED FOR THIS PLAN, WHICH INCLUDES REHABILITATION AND PREVENTION PROGRAMS. THE MEASURES HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED. HOWEVER, THE BUSH PLAN BRINGS HOPE IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG USAGE. THIS IS A COCAINE BY-PRODUCT CALLED CRACK WHICH WAS CONFISCATED A FEW DAYS AGO BY POLICEMEN AT A PARK IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE. IT COULD HAVE BEEN HEROIN OR PCP. IT LOOKS LIKE CANDY, BUT THIS IS TURNING OUR CITIES INTO BATTLEFIELDS AND IS KILLING OUR CHILDREN. THIS IS HOW PRESIDENT BUSH BEGAN HIS SPEECH, IN WHICH HE DELIVERED HIS PLAN TO U.S. CITIZENS ON FIGHTING DRUG TRAFFICKERS. THE HUGE NUMBER OF DRUG USERS MADE THE GOVERNMENT INCREASE THE $2 BILLION BUDGET LAST YEAR. AS YOU CAN SEE ON THIS CHART, IN 1985 THE GOVERNMENT ESTIMATED THAT 23 MILLION U.S. CITIZENS WERE USING DRUGS ON A CASUAL BASIS; THAT IS, AT LEAST ONCE DURING THE PAST MONTH. LAST YEAR, THIS FIGURE DROPPED BY OVER 1/3, WHICH MEANS THAT 9 MILLION U.S. CITIZENS HAVE CEASED BEING OCCASIONAL DRUG USERS. ALTHOUGH THE OVERALL COCAINE USAGE HAS DROPPED, THE FREQUENT USE OF COCAINE HAS ALMOST DOUBLED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. THESE ARE THE CASUAL COCAINE USERS, THOSE WHO CONSUME CRACK, AND WHO REPRESENT THE MOST SERIOUS AND URGENT PROBLEM. PRESIDENT BUSH'S ADVISERS SAID THE PRESIDENT IS AWARE OF THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE PLAN, HOWEVER HE BELIEVES THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUGS. TODAY, I SENT THIS DOCUMENT. OUR FIRST NATIONAL STRATEGY ON DRUG CONTROL. I SENT IT TO THE CONGRESS. BUSH BELIEVES THAT WITH THIS FORMULA HE WILL DEFEAT DRUG USAGE IN HIS COUNTRY, DESPITE CRITICISM FROM SOME U.S. CONGRESSMEN.
DEV-MUC3-0437	BOGOTA, 6 SEP 89 -- THE MEDELLIN CARTEL REACTED WITH A CAMPAIGN OF ATTACKS TO U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH'S ANTIDRUG PROGRAM. AS OF THIS MORNING THE SPEECH HAD NOT ELICITED ANY OFFICIAL COMMENT ON THE PART OF THE COLOMBIAN PRESIDENCY. ONLY COMMUNICATIONS MINISTER CARLOS ELMOS STATED IN VERY GENERAL TERMS THAT THE PROBLEM CONTINUES TO BE "FUNDAMENTALLY THAT OF THE CONSUMPTION IN THE UNITED STATES," WHICH HE ADDED MUST "PUNISH THE CONSUMERS." SHORTLY AFTER PRESIDENT BUSH'S SPEECH, A WAVE OF ATTACKS SHOOK MEDELLIN, THE GENERAL HEADQUARTERS OF THE COUNTRY'S PRINCIPAL DRUG TRAFFICKERS. ACCORDING TO A POLICE REPORT ISSUED TODAY 11 PERSONS, INCLUDING 2 NEWSMEN, WERE WOUNDED IN THE ATTACKS. THE BOGOTA NEWSPAPERS DEDICATED THEIR MAIN HEADLINES THIS MORNING TO THE U.S. PRESIDENT'S SPEECH. IN GENERAL THEY COMPARED HIS SPEECH TO A DECLARATION OF WAR: "BUSH WAGES WAR , "BUSH DECLARES WAR" , "8 BILLION AGAINST DRUGS" . THE NEWSPAPERS DID NOT DEDICATE ANY EDITORIAL TO BUSH'S SPEECH, BUT LIMITED THEMSELVES TO PUBLISHING EXCERPTS OF HIS SPEECH, TAKING SPECIAL NOTE OF THE 5-YEAR $2 BILLION AID PLAN FOR COLOMBIA, PERU, AND BOLIVIA. THE COLOMBIAN TELEVISION STATIONS, WHICH HAD ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WOULD CARRY A LIVE BROADCAST OF THE OVERALL ANTIDRUG PLAN, FINALLY ENDED UP ONLY TRANSMITTING EXCERPTS OF THE SPEECH ON A DELAYED BASIS, WITHOUT EXPLAINING THE REASON FOR THE CHANGE OF PLANS. ONLY CARACOL RADIO REBROADCAST THE TEXT OF PRESIDENT BUSH'S SPEECH ON A DELAYED BASIS WITH A SIMULTANEOUS SPANISH TRANSLATION.

INCLUDING MARTINEZ, 15 COLOMBIANS HAVE BEEN EXTRADITED TO THE UNITED STATES, 14 OF THEM DURING THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT'S TENURE, WHILE THE EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE UNITED STATES WAS IN FORCE. THE FIRST EXTRADITION WAS EFFECTED ON THE SAME GROUNDS AS THAT SERVING TO JUSTIFY THIS MEASURE TOWARD MARTINEZ-- MONEY LAUNDERING. AFTER BOTERO , THE MOST FAMOUS CASES WERE THOSE OF CARLOS LEHDER, WHOSE EXTRADITION WAS ARRANGED FOR IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS. WHEN THE SUPREME COURT DECLARED THE TREATY UNENFORCEABLE, EXTRADITIONS WERE SUSPENDED UNTIL TODAY, WHEN A NEW INSTRUMENT WAS UTILIZED. THIS INSTRUMENT WAS ANNOUNCED BY PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO THE SAME NIGHT PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LUIS CARLOS GALAN WAS MURDERED.

ASKED WHEN THE JUDGES WOULD BE TAKEN TO MILITARY BASES, ATTORNEY GENERAL GOMEZ REPLIED: "I CANNOT MENTION A SPECIFIC TIME.

DEV-MUC3-0446	BOGOTA, 7 SEP 89 -- THE POLICE ARE CONTINUING TO SCORE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND ALLEGED ASSASSINS.

THE M-19'S NUMBER-ONE MAN, CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ, SAID THAT PEACE CANNOT BE ACCOMPLISHED IF THE ORGANIZATION'S MEMBERS ARE MURDERED BY GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS. I AM CONCERNED THAT THE M-19 MEMBERS ARE BEING MURDERED BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. WHY ARE YOU SURE OF THIS? WE HAVE TO BE SURE OF WHO IS BEHIND THIS.

EDUARDO MARTINEZ ROMERO, SUSPECTED "FINANCE CHIEF" OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, WAS SENT TO THE UNITED STATES ON WEDNESDAY. THE BOMBINGS HAVE MAINLY AFFECTED BOGOTA AND MEDELLIN, WHERE AUTHORITIES HAVE IMPLEMENTED UNPRECEDENTED SECURITY MEASURES TO PREVENT TERRORIST ACTIONS. A POLICE SPOKESMAN SAID THAT SECURITY HAS BEEN REINFORCED IN TERMINALS, GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS, MEDIA OFFICES, AND AQUEDUCTS OF THE MAIN CITIES BECAUSE OF CONSTANT THREATS THAT THE MAFIAS WILL BLOW UP THOSE LOCATIONS. MANY RESIDENTS OF BOGOTA HAVE BEEN COMMENTING ON RUMORS THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS PLAN TO PLACE TOXIC SUBSTANCES IN THE AQUEDUCT OF THIS CITY OF 6 MILLION PEOPLE. THE RUMOR HAS NEITHER BEEN DENIED NOR CONFIRMED BY AUTHORITIES.

THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE, WHOM AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT YET IDENTIFIED, WAS ALSO KILLED IN THE ATTACK. PELAEZ GONZALEZ HAD PRESIDED OVER A "SESSION FOR PEACE" ON 18 AUGUST IN MEDELLIN, WHICH IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST VIOLENT CITIES IN THE WORLD. ON THAT VERY DAY, COLONEL WALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO OF THE POLICE FORCE IN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, WHOSE CAPITAL IS MEDELLIN, WAS MURDERED. PELAEZ GONZALEZ WAS MAYOR OF MEDELLIN BETWEEN 3 MAY 1984 AND THE END OF 1985, AND WAS CURRENTLY THE PRESIDENT OF THE "TIN PLATE AND LAMINATING COMPANY" . THE AUTHORITIES HAVE ATTRIBUTED THE MURDER TO THE DRUG MAFIAS, WHO ON 24 AUGUST ANNOUNCED A COUNTEROFFENSIVE TO THE GOVERNMENT MEASURES, WHICH ARE A DECLARATION OF "TOTAL WAR" AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING. ON 24 AUGUST, AFTER A NUMBER OF ATTACKS, THE "EXTRADITABLES," THE ARMED BRANCH OF THE "MEDELLIN CARTEL," WHO, WITH THE CALI CARTEL ARE CONSIDERED THE WORLD'S LEADING COCAINE PRODUCERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, SAID THAT THEY WOULD RESPOND TO THE WAR WITH ATTACKS ON "POLITICIANS, JUDGES, JUSTICES, UNION AND COMPANY PRESIDENTS, JOURNALISTS, AND THE OLIGARCHY."

DEV-MUC3-0466	VIENNA , 12 SEP 89 -- "NONE OF US WANTED THE WAR. NOW THAT WE STARTED IT, WE HAVE TO WIN IT." WITH THESE WORDS MARGARET J. ANSTEE, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE UN OFFICE IN VIENNA, OPENED THE SECOND INTERREGIONAL MEETING OF THE HEADS OF NATIONAL DRUG LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN VIENNA ON MONDAY . THE CONFERENCE, WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO LAST UNTIL FRIDAY, FOCUSES ON INTERNATIONAL TRENDS AND STRATEGIES IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE ILLEGAL NARCOTICS TRADE, AS WELL AS THE DRAWING UP OF A FIRST "POSITIVE BALANCE SHEET" SINCE THE VIENNA HONLEA MEETING OF 1986, AND THE 1987 INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS CONFERENCE. SPECIAL EMPHASIS WILL BE PUT ON THE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN COLOMBIA AND ALL OTHER PARTS OF LATIN AMERICA. "WITH ITS FIGHT AGAINST THE ILLEGAL NARCOTICS TRADE, COLOMBIA HAS ASSURED ITSELF A PLACE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR AGAINST DRUGS," ANSTEE SAID. THIS "BATTLE" IS NOT AN ISOLATED PROBLEM OF AN INDIVIDUAL STATE, BUT A CONCERN OF THE WHOLE WORLD, SHE SAID. "EVEN THE MURDER OF A COLOMBIAN JUDGE, POLICE HEAD, OR POLITICIAN, WHO WAS TRYING HARD TO BRING DRUG DEALERS TO COURT, IS NOT MERELY AN ATTACK AGAINST HIS PERSON AND HIS FAMILY, NOT ONLY ONE AGAINST THE LAWS AND THE GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO AN ASSAULT AGAINST US ALL, THE UN OFFICIAL SAID. SHE EMPHASIZED THAT IT IS NOW PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT THE ANTI-DRUG CONVENTION, WHICH WAS CONCLUDED IN 1988 AND, UP TO NOW, SIGNED BY 71 STATES, TRANSLATES INTO CONCRETE STEPS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE -- EVEN BEFORE THE PROTRACTED RATIFICATION PROCEDURE IS CONCLUDED. JAVIER CUELLO TREJO, THE MEXICAN WHO WAS ELECTED CHAIRMAN OF THE CONFERENCE BY ACCLAMATION, SAID: "THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUGS IS NOT ONLY OF ENORMOUS IMPORTANCE FOR LAWS AND GOVERNMENTS BUT ALSO FOR THE SURVIVAL OF THE ENTIRE MANKIND. WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTION, WE AND OUR PEOPLES ARE VICTIMS OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO LIVE FROM SUPPRESSING OTHER PEOPLE." THE SITUATION IN THE SPHERES OF THE NARCOTICS TRADE AND CONSUMPTION HAS DRAMATICALLY DETERIORATED EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD DURING THE PAST 3 YEARS, CHRISTOPH HARSDORF, HEAD OF THE FRG DELEGATION, NOTED AT THE PERIPHERY OF THE UN CONFERENCE.
DEV-MUC3-0467	BOGOTA, 12 SEP 89 -- CALI -- THE JUDGES AND COURT EMPLOYEES OF THE CALI JUDICIAL DISTRICT HAVE BEEN ON STRIKE SINCE YESTERDAY TO PROTEST THE KIDNAPPING OF ORLANDO CUELLER OSORIO, A COURT PROCESS SERVER OF THE 12TH MUNICIPAL PENAL COURT. FOUR HEAVILY ARMED INDIVIDUALS, WHO POSED AS SECRET AGENTS, KIDNAPPED MR CUELLAR OSORIO FROM HIS HOME IN THE FLORALIA NEIGHBORHOOD, IN EASTERN CALI. TELEPHONE CALLS MADE BY TERRORISTS SAY THE OFFICIAL HAS BEEN KILLED. THE AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DETERMINE HIS WHEREABOUTS.
DEV-MUC3-0468	SAN JOSE , 12 SEP 89 -- THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION OF GUATEMALA CHARGED HERE TODAY THE "SHARED RESPONSIBILITY" OF PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO AND THE SECRET SERVICE OF THE ARMY IN THE DEATH OF FOUR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, WHOSE BRUTALLY MUTILATED BODIES WERE FOUND ON 10 SEPTEMBER IN A GUATEMALA CITY SUBURB. THE FINDING COMES IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAVE OF KIDNAPPINGS, KILLINGS, AND DYNAMITE ATTACKS WHICH WERE UNLEASHED STARTING IN MID-JULY AND WHICH HAS SHOCKED THE GUATEMALANS. THE WHEREABOUTS OF SEVEN OTHER STUDENTS, KIDNAPPED BY ALLEGED DEATH SQUADS, REMAIN UNKNOWN. THESE SQUADS HAVE BEEN ON THE RAMPAGE SINCE 23 AUGUST. IN A COMMUNIQUE TO VARIOUS POLITICAL, TRADE UNION, AND HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS, THE CHDG BRANCH IN SAN JOSE REQUESTED "URGENTLY" THE SENDING OF MESSAGES TO THE GUATEMALAN EMBASSIES, GOVERNMENT, AND ARMY CONDEMNING THE "IMPUNITY" OF THE DEATH SQUADS. TWO OF THE MURDERED VICTIMS -- SILVIA AZURDIA AND HER HUSBAND VICTOR HUGO RODRIGUEZ -- WERE ABDUCTED BY EIGHT MEN IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES BEFORE WITNESSES WHO EVEN PROVIDED THE AUTHORITIES WITH THE LICENSE PLATE NUMBERS OF THE TWO VEHICLES USED BY THE KIDNAPPERS. THE CDHG EXPRESSED "DEEP CONCERN OVER THESE EVENTS WHICH REFLECT A TOTAL LACK OF POLITICAL WILLINGNESS" ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT TO END REPRESSION AGAINST THE PEOPLE. ACCORDING TO HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS, GUATEMALA HOLDS A RECORD IN THE HEMISPHERE, 40,000 MISSING PERSONS IN THE LAST 20 YEARS. ON 11 SEPTEMBER, IT WAS OFFICIALLY REPORTED THAT THE MUTILATED AND BULLET-RIDDLED BODIES OF THREE MORE UNIDENTIFIED GUATEMALANS WERE FOUND. ONE OF THE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS KILLED LAST WEEKEND WAS CARLOS HUMBERTO CABRERA, WHO HAD RETURNED TO GUATEMALA AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF EXILE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE GUARANTEES ANNOUNCED BY THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT TO REPATRIATE HOME ANY GUATEMALAN WHO WISHED TO COME, THE LOCAL PRESS REPORTED TODAY. ON THE OTHER HAND, HUMBERTO CHUTA, A BROTHER OF ONE OF THE VICTIMS, STATED THAT "IT SEEMS THAT WE ARE GOING TO LIVE ALL OUR LIVES AS IF WE WERE DOGS." HE REQUESTED CEREZO "DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO INVESTIGATE THE SITUATION, IF HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED."
DEV-MUC3-0469	SAN SALVADOR, 12 SEP 89 -- SINCE A MINE IS A WEAPON OF A MILITARY NATURE AND SINCE ITS USE HAS INCREASED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS THROUGHOUT VARIOUS UNPOPULATED AREAS OF THE COUNTRY WHERE MINE FIELDS HAVE BEEN PLANTED, THE SWEEPING OF THIS TYPE OF WEAPON WILL NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE DONE GRADUALLY FOR TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL REASONS. THEREFORE, THE MEASURES TO BE ADOPTED TO SUSPEND THEIR USE WILL BE: 1. END THE MANUFACTURING OF BOOBY TRAPS. 2. END TO THE PLANTING OF NEW MINE FIELDS. 3. IMMEDIATE REMOVAL OF ALL MINES PLANTED IN AREAS OF HIGH RISK FOR THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AND MARKING OF THOSE AREAS THAT, FOR TECHNICAL REASONS -- LOSS OF MAP OF THE MINED AREAS -- CANNOT BE SWEPT IMMEDIATELY. 4. GRADUAL SWEEPING OF THE MINE FIELDS LOCATED IN AREAS OF LOW RISK FOR THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AND MARKING OF SITES WHERE, FOR TECHNICAL REASONS, THE MINES CANNOT BE REMOVED. 5. THIS ORDER DOES NOT INCLUDE THE CLAYMORE MINES USED IN THE AMBUSH OF SOLDIERS. WE WILL COORDINATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE MEASURES WITH HUMANITARIAN AID ORGANIZATIONS AND THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES. LIKEWISE, WE EXPECT THE ARMY TO SWEEP THE MINE FIELDS THAT SURROUND THE GARRISONS AND FIXED MILITARY POSTS LOCATED IN HEAVILY POPULATED AREAS. THESE MINES ARE CONSTANTLY HARMING THE PEOPLE OR THEIR DOMESTIC ANIMALS. LIKEWISE, THE ARMY MUST CEASE ALL BOMBING AND SHELLING OF CIVILIAN TARGETS. FMLN GENERAL COMMAND EL SALVADOR, 11 SEPTEMBER 1989
DEV-MUC3-0470	SUCRE, 3 SEP 89 -- EARLY SUNDAY MORNING TERRORISTS ATTACKED THE STUDIOS OF THE CHANNEL 6 TELEVISION STATION, WHICH IS PART OF THE ATB NATIONAL SYSTEM. THIS ATTACK COMES LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER A TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST THE FACILITIES OF THE REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION. SOURCES FROM THE LOCAL TELEVISION STATION HAVE TOLD PRESENCIA THAT AT APPROXIMATELY 1330, UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS HURLED A MOLOTOV COCKTAIL THAT EXPLODED OUTSIDE THE BUILDING IN THE BANCARIO NEIGHBORHOOD. SOME WINDOWS WERE BROKEN. THREE DAYS EARLIER, TWO SMALL DYNAMITE STICKS WERE THROWN AT THE CORPORATE OFFICES NEAR THE YPFB'S GUALBERTO VILLAROEL REFINERY.
DEV-MUC3-0471	LIMA, 12 SEP 89 -- FOREIGN MINISTER GUILLERMO LARCO COX TODAY LABELED THE U.S. AID TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING IN SOUTH AMERICA AS MEAGER. HE SAID THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SHOULD RECONSIDER THE AID GIVEN TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING. I UNDERSTAND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATED AN AMOUNT WITHOUT PREVIOUS STUDY AND WITHOUT CONSULTING WITH THE COUNTRIES INVOLVED. IF THAT IS TRUE, THE U.S. AID CAN JUSTIFIABLY BE CALLED RIDICULOUS. WHAT CONTACTS HAVE YOU HAD WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TO EXPLAIN THAT THE RESOURCES APPROPRIATED TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING ARE NOT ENOUGH? THE CONTACTS WILL BE MADE DURING THE MEETINGS TO BE HELD BY THE PRESIDENTS OF BOLIVIA, COLOMBIA, AND PERU WITH U.S. PRESIDENT BUSH. THE TALKS THERE WILL BE FRANK AND THE MISTAKES MADE CAN THEN BE CORRECTED. COLOMBIA IS FACING A SERIOUS PROBLEM IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING. WHAT ACTION IS THE FOREIGN MINISTRY TAKING TO SUPPORT COLOMBIA? THE PRESIDENT IS THE ONE WHO RUNS INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, AND PRESIDENT GARCIA'S DECISION TO VISIT PRESIDENT BARCO AND TO HONOR ASSASSINATED SENATOR GALAN SHOWS THE PRESIDENT'S SUPPORT FOR COLOMBIA AND THE DIRECTION OF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY'S ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE ARE WORKING WITH THE COLOMBIAN AND BOLIVIAN FOREIGN MINISTRIES TO PREPARE AN AGENDA AS A BASIS FOR A TRIPARTITE MEETING, AS A FIRST STAGE BEFORE THE MEETING WITH PRESIDENT BUSH.
DEV-MUC3-0472	MEXICO CITY , 13 SEP 89 -- REBEL COMMANDER SHAFIK HANDAL IN THE MEXICAN CAPITAL TODAY SAID THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS HAVE PROPOSED NINE POINTS "THAT REFLECT THE ASPIRATIONS OF THE ENTIRE NATION" TO THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT. HANDAL POINTED OUT THAT THEY WILL BE STUDIED TODAY AND TOMORROW DURING MEETINGS HERE BETWEEN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT AND A SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DELEGATION. THE NINE POINTS REVEALED BY THE GUERRILLA COMMANDER ARE: 1. BEGINNING OF A PROCESS TO INTRODUCE AMENDMENTS TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AGREED UPON BY CONSENSUS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION PARTIES. 2. JOINT ACCORD ON MEASURES TO ENSURE THE END OF ALL FORMS OF REPRESSION AND FULL RESPECT FOR DEMOCRATIC LIBERTIES THAT WOULD BE VERIFIED BY THE UNITED NATIONS AND OAS. 3. PACT TO CONTINUE HONEST JUDICIAL PROCESS GUARANTEEING THE DETERMINATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND PUNISHMENT OF THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF MONSIGNOR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO AND ALL THOSE INVOLVED IN DEATH SQUADS. 4. ACCORD TO DISSOLVE THE ECONOMIC STRUCTURE THAT CAUSES POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CONFRONTATION THROUGH THE MAINTENANCE OF REFORMS PROMOTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, WHO PRECEDED CRISTIANI. 5. PACT ON MEASURES FOR SELF-MONITORING AND PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE ARMED FORCES. 6. COMMITMENT FROM THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT THAT IT WILL SUBMIT ACCORDS ON CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS THAT COULD EMERGE FROM THIS DIALOGUE THAT BEGINS TODAY FOR APPROVAL BY THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY. 7. ACCORD TO ADVANCE LEGISLATIVE AND MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS TO BRING ABOUT CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND ACCELERATE AN END TO THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR. 8. MUTUAL GUARANTEES FOR THE OPERATION AND SETTLEMENT OF FORCES THAT WILL GUARANTEE RESPECT FOR A CEASE-FIRE WITHOUT THIS IMPLYING A VIOLATION OF THE NATIONAL TERRITORY. 9. INITIAL STEPS FOR THE INCORPORATION OF THE FMLN INTO SALVADORAN POLITICAL LIFE. AS FOR THIS LATTER POINT, HANDAL SAID THAT THE FMLN MUST BECOME A POLITICAL PARTY BY REGISTERING ITS FOLLOWERS AND ESTABLISHING A RAPPORT WITH THE MEDIA. HE POINTED OUT THAT THIS GUERRILLA GROUP HAS ESTABLISHED A "NO LATER THAN 15 NOVEMBER" DEADLINE TO ACHIEVE A CEASE-FIRE ACCORD.
DEV-MUC3-0473	MEXICO CITY , 13 SEP 89 -- WITH MODERATE OPTIMISM, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS OPENED A DIALOGUE IN MEXICO CITY TODAY TO ESTABLISH PEACE IN EL SALVADOR, WITH A SPECTACULAR PRIOR ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE INSURGENTS THAT THEY ARE PREPARED TO DECLARE A DEFINITIVE CEASE-FIRE AND BECOME A POLITICAL PARTY. THIS PROPOSAL -- WHICH ENTAILS A DECISION TO LAY DOWN ARMS IF CERTAIN PRIOR CONDITIONS ARE MET -- DID NOT MEET WITH A MATCHING PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNMENT. THE DISCUSSIONS ARE TAKING PLACE IN A MODERN BUILDING BELONGING TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION IN A RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT IN THE SOUTHERN SECTION OF MEXICO CITY. COMMANDER MIGUEL SAENZ OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT SAID DURING A RECESS THAT "THE GOVERNMENT'S COMMISSION DID NOT BRING ANY SUBSTANTIVE PROPOSAL." ALL THE MEN WERE WEARING COATS AND TIE, WHEREAS THE FEMALE FMLN COMMANDERS WERE IN VERY FORMAL ATTIRE. THE MEETING IS TAKING PLACE IN A 10-SQUARE-METER ROOM IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATES AND GUERRILLAS SIT FACE-TO-FACE, WITH THE MODERATORS AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE. THE ROOM HAS AN ANNEX TO WHICH THE NEGOTIATORS WITHDRAW DURING RECESSES TO ANALYZE THE OTHER SIDE'S POSITIONS. MSGR ROMEO TOBAR ASTORGA, WHO IS THE MODERATOR OF THE MEETING AND PRESIDENT OF THE SALVADORAN EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE, HAD ASSERTED BEFORE THE START OF THE MEETING THAT HE COULD SEE A WILLINGNESS ON BOTH SIDES "TO END A WAR THAT HAS CAUSED MANY VICTIMS." "ALTHOUGH I AM NOT A MARXIST, BECAUSE THAT IDEOLOGY IS ATHEISTIC AND MATERIALISTIC, I AM CONVINCED THAT IT IS URGENT THAT THIS DIALOGUE LEAD TO THE PEACE WE LONG FOR," HE ALSO SAID. SAENZ, WHO ALSO SOUNDED OPTIMISTIC BUT CAUTIOUS, SAID DURING A BRIEF TALK WITH NEWSMEN THAT PROCEDURES FOR THIS AND SUBSEQUENT MEETINGS ARE UNDER DISCUSSION, AND TIMETABLES, STAGES, AND SITES SHOULD RESULT FROM THEM. SHORTLY BEFORE THE MEETING BEGAN, OSCAR SANTAMARIA, WHO IS THE JUSTICE MINISTER AND ONE OF THE OFFICIAL DELEGATES, ASSERTED THAT "THERE IS UTMOST WILLINGNESS TO ACHIEVE PEACE" ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT. IN ADDITION TO SANTAMARIA, THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATION ARE PRESIDENCY MINISTER JUAN MARTINEZ, POET DAVID ESCOBAR, AND ADVISERS HECTOR CONTRERAS AND ABELARDO TORRES. TOBAR ASTORGA IS ACCOMPANIED BY MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR. BESIDES SAENZ, THE FMLN IS REPRESENTED BY COMMANDERS SHAFIK HANDAL, SALVADOR SAMAYOA, ANA GUADALUPE MARTINEZ, MERCEDES LETONA, MARIO ROJAS, AND DANIEL LOPEZ. AT 1045 , 1 HOUR BEFORE THE MEETING BEGAN, THE FMLN RELEASED ITS PROPOSAL TO THE PRESS, WHICH INCLUDES A CEASE-FIRE ON 15 NOVEMBER, A DEFINITIVE END TO THE HOSTILITIES ON 31 JANUARY, AND THE INCORPORATION OF ITS LEADERS AND ACTIVISTS INTO THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL LIFE THROUGH A POLITICAL PARTY. THE CONDITIONS DEMANDED BY THE FMLN INCLUDE REFORMS TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEMS, AN END TO ALL MANNER OF REPRESSION, THE PURGING AND PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE ARMED FORCES, THE FULL EXERCISE OF FREEDOMS , THE REORGANIZATION OF THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM, THE HOLDING OF THE 1991 LEGISLATIVE AND MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE, AND AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE ASSASSINATION OF MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO. THE FIRST STEP THE FMLN WOULD TAKE ONCE THE CEASE-FIRE IS IN PLACE WOULD BE TO LEGALIZE THE STATUS OF ITS MILITANTS AND ITS MEDIA. "THIS STEP INVOLVES RISKS, BUT WE ARE WILLING TO TAKE THEM," THE GUERRILLA DELEGATES SAID. THE TALKS WERE CONTINUING EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON WITHOUT ACCESS TO THE PRESS AND AMID A DISCREET SECURITY MEASURE ESTABLISHED BY THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT -- JUST A COUPLE OF MEN WITH "WALKIE-TALKIES" AND DISGUISED WEAPONS. SAVE FOR AN UNFORESEEN OBSTACLE, THE MEETING IS SCHEDULED TO CONTINUE TOMORROW, THURSDAY.
DEV-MUC3-0474	GUAYAQUIL, 13 SEP 89 -- A BOMB EXPLODED TODAY BEFORE DAWN IN GUAYAQUIL AT THE RESIDENCE OF ECUADORAN FELIPE COSTA, CANADA'S HONORARY CONSUL IN ECUADOR. THE BOMB PARTIALLY DESTROYED THE RESIDENCE, THE POLICE CONFIRMED. NO ORGANIZATION OR INDIVIDUAL HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TERRORIST ATTACK, WHICH CAUSED NO INJURIES. THE BOMB, WHICH WENT OFF TODAY AT 0300 LOCAL TIME , SHATTERED THE FRONT WINDOWS AND DESTROYED THE FRONT DOORS OF THE RESIDENCE AND DAMAGED THE HONORARY CONSUL'S AUTOMOBILE. ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, UNIDENTIFIED MEN IN A LUXURY CAR CIRCLED THE RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD SEVERAL TIMES AND THEN THREW A PACKAGE CONTAINING SEVERAL DYNAMITE STICKS, WHICH EXPLODED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. THE PERSONNEL CONSULTED AT FELIPE COSTA'S RESIDENCE AND OFFICE WOULD NOT COMMENT ON THIS INCIDENT AND SAID THE CONSUL COULD NOT BE REACHED BECAUSE HE WAS RESTING. CANADA DOES NOT HAVE AN EMBASSY IN ECUADOR. IT HAS AN EMBASSY IN BOGOTA WHERE IT HAS A ROVING AMBASSADOR.
DEV-MUC3-0475	CLANDESTINE, 13 SEP 89 -- AFTER WE ANNOUNCED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A UNILATERAL TRUCE, 3D BRIGADE COMMANDER COLONEL MAURICIO VARGAS ORDERED THE INCURSION OF THE ARCE BATTALION INTO OUR TERRITORY IN NORTHERN MORAZAN DEPARTMENT. SINCE THE AFTERNOON OF 12 SEPTEMBER, THE AIR FORCE, USING HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS AND C-47 AIRCRAFT AS WELL AS ARTILLERY, HAS REPEATEDLY BOMBED AND STRAFED AREAS NEAR PERQUIN, ENDANGERING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. AT NOON TODAY, 13 SEPTEMBER, THE ARCE BATTALION INDISCRIMINATELY BOMBED AREAS NEAR PERKIN, WHERE A C-47 AIRCRAFT STRAFED THIS DENSELY POPULATED AREA. AS A RESULT OF THIS ACTION, AN ELDERELY MAN NAMED JULIO RODRIGUEZ WAS KILLED AND SEVERAL HOUSES WERE DAMAGED. THE FMLN HOLDS COL VARGAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE VICTIMS AND DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE AIR ATTACKS AND THE ACTIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE ARCE BATTALION. WE MUST NOTE THAT THESE ACTIONS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION ARE TAKING PLACE AT A TIME WHEN THE FMLN HAS SHOWN ITS GOODWILL IN VARIOUS WAYS IN ORDER TO CREATE THE NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR A SERIOUS AND RESPONSIBLE DIALOGUE.
DEV-MUC3-0476	PANAMA CITY , 12 SEP 89 -- NICARAGUA WILL HOLD GENERAL ELECTIONS NEXT YEAR IN FEBRUARY. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, THROUGH ITS INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, HAS BEEN BRAZENLY MANEUVERING SO THAT THE ELECTIONS WILL BE FAVORABLE TO THE EMPIRE'S INTERESTS IN CENTRAL AMERICA. BESIDES ITS INTELLIGENCE SERVICES, THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS MAINTAINED A TEAM DEDICATED TO ELECTORAL TERRORISM TO SERVE THE OPPOSITION SECTORS IN HANDLING CAMPAIGN PROPAGANDA, DISTRIBUTING MONEY, AND FALSIFYING AND STEALING TALLY SHEETS. THESE TERRORIST AGENTS BELIEVE THAT THEIR EXPERIENCE IN PANAMA, WHERE THEY CLAIM THEY WERE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL, CAN BE APPLIED TO NICARAGUA. AS A FIRST STEP TOWARD PROCLAIMING U.S. INTERVENTION IN THE FEBRUARY ELECTIONS IN NICARAGUA, PRESIDENT BUSH IS "CONSIDERING" MAKING AN INITIAL DONATION OF $3 MILLION TO THE OPPOSITION. THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS ALLEGEDLY SAID THAT "PRESIDENT BUSH HAS BEEN CONSIDERING RESORTING TO THE CIA TO CONTROL THE NICARAGUAN ELECTIONS AND TO DISTRIBUTE MONEY TO OPPOSITION PARTY LEADERS." ACCORDING TO THE SAME SOURCE, PRESIDENT BUSH IS NOT DISCARDING THE USE OF THE SO-CALLED "CONTRAS" TO HARASS THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT FROM HONDURAS TO CREATE CHAOS DURING THE ELECTIONS, GIVING THE UNITED STATES AN EXCUSE TO OCCUPY NICARAGUA MILITARILY." ACCORDING TO CONTINENTAL OBSERVERS, PRESIDENT BUSH HAS DECIDED "THAT THE NICARGUAN ELECTIONS MUST BE WON BY THE UNITED STATES." VIOLETA DE CHAMORRO'S CANDIDACY IS A SIMPLE COVER-UP, THE SAME AS THE CANDIDACY LAUNCHED BY THE SECTORS THAT OPPOSE OUR COUNTRY'S CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT. ANY ANALYST CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT "THE UNITED STATES IS NOT GOING TO TAKE ITS HANDS OFF CENTRAL AMERICA." THAT IS WHY WASHINGTON IS SEEKING FORMULAS TO SEND MONEY TO THE OPPOSITION, NOT ONLY LEGALLY, BUT ALSO THROUGH ILLEGAL CHANNELS AND PHANTOM ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH, UNDER THE EXCUSE OF "DEFENDING DEMOCRACY" OPERATE IN AFGHANISTAN, ANGOLA, AND THE MIDDLE EAST; SUPPORT APARTHEID IN SOUTH AFRICA; AND ENGAGE IN OTHER TERRORIST ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. PRESIDENT BUSH HAS SAID THAT "THE FEBRUARY ELECTIONS IN NICARAGUA ARE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT AN END TO THE MARXIST GOVERNMENT IN NICARAGUA HEADED BY DANIEL ORTEGA." ACCORDING TO ANALYSTS, "THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS READY TO SPEND AT LEAST $200 MILLION TO WIN THE ELECTIONS IN NICARAGUA." IT IS ALSO READY TO EXPAND SANCTIONS AGAINST THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT, THEREBY INCREASING DESPERATION, BECAUSE IT BELIEVES THAT THE PEOPLE'S DESPERATION, MISERY, HUNGER, AND DEATHS MIGHT PRODUCE A REBELLION FAVORABLE TO U.S. INTERESTS."
DEV-MUC3-0477	GUATEMALA CITY, 14 SEP 89 -- OFFICIAL SOURCES ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THE COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE DISCOVERED THAT MEMBERS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL PROVIDE ALTERED GUATEMALAN PASSPORTS TO COURIERS WHO BRING TO GUATEMALA COCAINE THAT IS LATER TAKEN TO THE UNITED STATES. ARTURO CHUR DEL CID, DIRECTOR OF THE GUATEMALAN IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT, HAS REPORTED THAT IN BOGOTA, DURING A RECENT MILITARY OPERATION AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, THE POLICE SEIZED THREE GUATEMALAN PASSPORTS. THE SEIZED DOCUMENTS WERE ISSUED TO GERMAN ALBERTO MARIN RAMOS, CESAR AUGUSTO SALDANA, AND IRMA YOLANDA SAMAYOA VELIZ. CHUR DEL CID SAID: "THE PASSPORTS WERE ISSUED BY GUATEMALA'S IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT. THEY COULD HAVE BEEN STOLEN AND TAKEN TO COLOMBIA WHERE THEY WERE FOUND WITH DIFFERENT PHOTOGRAPHS, READY FOR USE BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS." THE OFFICIAL SAID THAT THE DOCUMENTS WERE CAREFULLY ANALYZED AND THAT IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT DATA ON THE PASSPORTS WAS ALTERED AND THAT THE PHOTOGRAPHS WERE NOT THOSE OF THE TRUE OWNERS OF THE DOCUMENTS. AS A RESULT OF THIS SITUATION, ANYONE WITH A COLOMBIAN VISA WANTING TO COME TO GUATEMALA MUST FIRST CONSULT WITH AUTHORITIES TO SEE IF THIS IS POSSIBLE. THIS IS A PREVENTATIVE MEASURE TO KEEP THE COUNTRY FROM SERVING AS A SPRINGBOARD OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS.
DEV-MUC3-0478	BOGOTA, 14 SEP 89 -- THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT HAVE POSTPONED SIGNING A PEACE AGREEMENT BUT HAVE NOT BROKEN OFF THE NEGOTIATIONS, AN M-19 SPOKESMAN ANNOUNCED TODAY. RAFAEL PARDO RUEDA, PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER FOR PEACE AFFAIRS, ANNOUNCED THAT AFTER THE TALKS ON 13 SEPTEMBER IN SANTO DOMINGO , THE AGREEMENT FOR THE M-19 TO DEMOBILIZE AND RETURN TO POLITICAL LIFE WAS POSTPONED. IN STATEMENTS BY TELEPHONE TO REUTER FROM SANTO DOMINGO, HIPOLITO BLANCO, A RANKING M-19 SPOKESMAN, SAID "WE HOPE TO HOLD ANOTHER MEETING SOON; THE TOPICS WE MUST AGREE UPON ARE COMPLEX AND WE MUST TAKE TIME TO ANALYZE THEM." BLANCO POINTED OUT THAT "YESTERDAY'S MEETING WAS CHARACTERIZED BY CORDIALITY," BUT "THE MECHANISMS TO BROADEN DEMOCRACY IN THE COUNTRY AND DEMOBILIZATION" ARE ISSUES THAT MUST STILL BE STUDIED IN-DEPTH. BLANCO ADMITTED THAT ONE OF THE SUBJECTS BEING CONSIDERED IS A PARDON FOR M-19 MEMBERS, INCLUDING THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE VIOLENT OCCUPATION OF THE JUSTICE PALACE IN NOVEMBER 1985, WHEN APPROXIMATELY 100 PEOPLE WERE KILLED. THE M-19 IS ONE OF SIX ACTIVE GUERRILLA GROUPS IN COLOMBIA AND THE ONE THAT HAS MADE THE GREATEST PROGRESS IN PEACE TALKS WITH THE GOVERNMENT. THE GROUP IS NATIONALIST IN IDEOLOGY. IT HAS 1,000 ARMED MEN, IS BEST KNOWN FOR ITS SPECTACULAR OPERATIONS, AND MAY WELL BECOME THE FIRST COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA GROUP TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS INDEFINITELY. THE GOVERNMENT AND THE M-19 SIGNED A PEACE AGREEMENT ON 17 MARCH AND OPENED TALKS IN MAY WITH POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SECTORS CALLED "WORKING TABLES." THE INITIAL RESULTS OF THE "WORKING TABLES" -- WHICH ENDED THE FIRST WEEK OF JULY -- WILL BE PRESENTED TO CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENCY IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS, LAWS, OR DECREES. SOME OF THE REFORMS DEAL WITH THE REPRESENTATION OF MINORITY GROUPS IN CONGRESS AND MECHANISMS FOR THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE GUERRILLAS. OTHER GUERRILLA ORGANIZATIONS WILL PROBABLY MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT THIS MONTH TO SPEED UP THE PEACEMAKING PROCESS. THE ONLY GUERRILLA GROUP THAT HAS STAYED AWAY FROM THE PEACE PROCESS IS THE CASTROITE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY, WHICH CEASED BOMBING PIPELINES ON 25 AUGUST, BUT HAS CONTINUED ITS GUERRILLA OPERATIONS. ACCORDING TO MILITARY ESTIMATES, THE SIX INSURGENT GROUPS IN COLOMBIA HAVE A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 7,000 ARMED MEN.
DEV-MUC3-0479	BOGOTA, 14 SEP 89 -- COLOMBIAN SECRET POLICE SOURCES REPORTED THAT THE ALLEDGED DRUG TRAFFICKERS BERNARDO PELAEZ ROLDAN AND GUILLERMO BUENO DELGADO WERE ARRESTED TODAY. APPARENTLY, THE UNITED STATES HAS REQUESTED THAT THESE MEN BE EXTRADITED TO RESPOND TO CHARGES AGAINST THEM IN THAT COUNTRY. IT WAS REPORTED THAT PELAEZ ROLDAN WAS ARRESTED IN BOGOTA AND IS CHARGED BY A COURT IN DETROIT OF CONSPIRACY TO DISTRIBUTE COCAINE IN THE UNITED STATES. BUENO DELGADO WAS ARRESTED BY THE POLICE ON SAN ANDRES ISLAND IN THE CARIBBEAN AND WAS IMMEDIATELY TRANSFERRED TO BOGOTA AND HANDED OVER TO JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES. ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY, DAS, SPOKESMEN SAID THAT REQUESTS FOR EXTRADITION OF THE SUSPECTED DRUG LORD HAVE BEEN RECEIVED FROM FLORIDA AND CALIFORNIA COURTS, WHERE HE HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH SMUGGLING AT LEAST 5,000 KG OF COCAINE INTO THE UNITED STATES AND LAUNDERING DOLLARS OBTAINED AS A RESULT OF THIS ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. LAST WEEK, THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT EXTRADITED THE ALLEDGED "FINANCIAL HEAD" OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL TO THE UNITED STATES. HE IS EDUARDO MARTINEZ ROMERO AND HAS TO ANSWER CHARGES IN AN ATLANTA COURT OF "LAUNDERING" MORE THAN $1.2 BILLION THROUGH A PANAMANIAN BANK. THE DRUG-TRAFFICKING MAFIAS HAVE THREATENED TO MURDER 10 JUDGES FOR EACH COLOMBIAN EXTRADITED TO ANOTHER COUNTRY, AND THIS THREAT HAS THE WHOLE COUNTRY TENSE AND ANXIOUS. THERE ARE RUMORS CIRCULATING IN SEVERAL CITIES THAT NARCOCRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE PREPARING AN OPERATION CALLED "BLACK SEPTEMBER" THAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED NEXT WEEKEND BY POISONING WATER SUPPLIES AND ATTACKING COMMERCIAL CENTERS AND NIGHT CLUBS.
DEV-MUC3-0480	CLANDESTINE, 14 SEP 89 -- TODAY, 14 SEPTEMBER, THE CHIEFS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY ARCE BATTALION STATE THAT THE FMLN HAS BROKEN THE UNILATERAL TRUCE. THE ARCE BATTALION CHIEFS SAID THAT CLASHES TOOK PLACE IN THE AREA OF PERQUIN AND ADMITTED THAT TWO SOLDIERS WERE KILLED IN THE CLASHES. IN REGARD TO THOSE STATEMENTS, WE CONSIDER THAT: 1. FOR 7 YEARS AND AFTER HAVING BEEN EXPELLED FROM THAT AREA, THE GOVERNMENT FORCES DO NOT HAVE FIXED POSITIONS NORTH OF MORAZAN DEPARTMENT. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF OUR TRUCE, ARCE BATTALION TROOPS HAVE BEGUN TO ENTER OUR TERRITORIES. THUS, THE CASUALTIES SUSTAINED BY THE ARCE BATTALION ARE A RESULT OF ACTIONS IN WHICH THE FMLN ACTED IN DEFENSE OF ITS FORCES. 2. ALL ENEMY UNITS THAT CROSS THE TOROLA RIVER DURING AN OPERATION BECOME A MILITARY TARGET AND MORE SO IN THIS CASE, BECAUSE THE ARMED FORCES BOMBED AND STRAFFED PERQUIN CIVILIANS, AMONG WHOM THERE HAVE BEEN CASUALTIES. 3. WE REITERATE OUR POSITION OF MAINTAINING THE TRUCE DURING THE ESTABLISHED DAYS JUST AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING, ALTHOUGH UP UNTIL NOW THE REGIME HAS FAILED TO EXPRESS ANY GOODWILL; HAS REFUSED TO ALLOW THE EVACUATION OF THE WAR DISABLED; AND HAS INCREASED THE NUMBER OF BOMBINGS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.
DEV-MUC3-0481	HAVANA , 14 SEP 89 -- THE REBELS' DECISION TO EXPRESS THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ABANDON THE ARMED STRUGGLE AND MAKE OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT OF EL SALVADOR A LEGAL PARTY, FAR FROM WEAKENING THE GUERRILLA, STRENGTHENS ITS REVOLUTIONARY POSITION. A COMMENTARY WRITTEN BY RITA CEBALLOS FROM PRENSA LATINA NOTES THAT IN ADDITION OF BEING DECISIVE IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF A DRASTIC INTERNAL CHANGE, THE PROPOSAL MADE BY THE GUERRILLA IS A POLITICAL BLOW TO THE SALVADORAN EXTREME RIGHT. PRENSA LATINA ADDS THAT THE DISARMAMENT AND PEACE OFFER GIVES SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI A SITUATION HE HAS TO RESOLVE IN THE INTERNATIONAL AREA. NO MATTER WHAT THE OFFICIAL RESPONSE IS DURING THE CONSULTATION SESSIONS BEING HELD IN MEXICO BETWEEN THE EXTREME RIGHT'S NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FLMN, THE SALVADORAN REACTIONARIES WILL NOT BENEFIT. THE FLMN SAID IN THE MEETING IN MEXICO THAT EITHER THE REGIME ACCEPTS THE CONDITIONS SUGGESTED BY THE GUERRILLA OR PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ANNOUNCES HE FAVORS A WAR HE CANNOT WIN. THE GUERRILLA PROPOSES THE TOTAL CEASE OF HOSTILITIES BEFORE 31 JANUARY, END OF THE REPRESSION, SELF-CLEANING OF THE ARMY, AND THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE MUNICIPAL AND ELECTORAL SYSTEM, AMONG OTHER PROPOSALS. PRENSA LATINA COMMENTS THAT THE SWIFTNESS WITH WHICH THE GUERRILLA CHIEFS PRESENTED THEIR PROPOSALS AND THEIR CONTENTS LEFT CRISTIANI'S CABINET AT THE DEFENSIVE AS WELL AS ITS MANEUVERS TO DISARM THE REVOLUTIONARIES. THE AGREEMENT OF ARENA, THE ULTRA-RIGHT RULING PARTY, TO TALK WITH THE GUERRILLA OPENS A POSSIBILITY FOR PEACE IN EL SALVADOR. WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.
DEV-MUC3-0482	BOGOTA, 14 SEP 89 -- THE PRO-CASTROITE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION OF COLOMBIA DESTROYED A SECTION OF THE TECA - VASCONIA OIL PIPELINE IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY LAST NIGHT, THE COLOMBIAN OIL ENTERPRISE OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED TODAY. THE NEW TERRORIST ACTION WAS STAGED IN PUERTO BOYACA WHERE THE OIL PIPELINE WAS DESTROYED AND MUCH ELN PROPAGANDA WAS STREWN. ECOPETROL STATED THAT THE ATTACK OCCURRED "DESPITE THE SUBVERSIVE GROUP'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IT WILL SUSPEND THIS TYPE OF ACTION TO FACILITATE THE PUBLIC DEBATE OF OIL POLICY." THIS OIL PIPELINE CONNECTS VASCONIA IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY WITH THE LINE THAT GOES TO BARRANCABERMEJA IN CENTRAL COLOMBIA WHERE ECOPETROL HAS ITS MAIN REFINERY. THE ELN, A GUERRILLA GROUP THAT HAS BEEN WAGING AN ARMED STRUGGLE FOR 25 YEARS AND IS LED BY FORMER SPANISH PRIEST MANUEL PEREZ, CLAIMS THAT THE SABOTAGE AGAINST THE HYDROCARBONS AND MINING INDUSTRIES IS A WAY OF PREVENTING INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES FROM SACKING THE COUNTRY'S NATURAL RESOURCES. SINCE JANUARY 1988 WHEN IT BEGAN ITS ATTACKS ON OIL PIPELINES, THE ELN HAS CARRIED OUT MORE THAN 130 ATTACKS AGAINST THE TECA - VASCONIA PIPELINE, THE PACIFIC PIPELINE, AND THE COUNTRY'S MAIN OIL ARTERY, THE CANO LIMON - COVENAS PIPELINE.
DEV-MUC3-0483	BOGOTA, 14 SEP 89 -- THE THIRD PUBLIC JUDGE ISSUED ARREST WARRANTS FOR NORBERTO HERNANDEZ ROMERO AND RAFAEL RIVERA ALARCON AND CHARGED THEM WITH PARTICIPATING IN THE MURDER OF LIBERAL PARTY LEADER LUIS CARLOS GALAN SARMIENTO. THE SAME JUDGE ISSUED AN ARREST WARRANT FOR JAIME DE JESUS VALENCIA MARTINEZ AND CHARGED HIM WITH BEING THE MASTERMIND OF THE CRIME. THESE THREE PERSONS HAVE NOT BEEN ARRESTED AND ARE BEING SOUGHT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. LUIS ALFREDO GONZALEZ CHACON, PEDRO ZAMBRANO DELGADO, NORBERTO MURRILLO CHALARCA, ARMANDO BERNAL ACOSTA, HECTOR MANUEL ZEPEDA QUINTERO, AND ALBERTO JUBIS HASZVUMB WERE ARRESTED A FEW DAYS AGO IN BOGOTA AND CHARGED WITH BEING ACCOMPLICES TO THE CRIME. THE THIRD CIVIL JUDGE ALSO DECIDED TO RELEASE LUIS FELIPE TORRES, THE MAN WHO CARRIED A POSTER AND A HAT AT THE MURDER SCENE AND WHO WAS INITIALLY ACCUSED OF HAVING PARTICIPATED IN THE CRIME. IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT JAIME DE JESUS VALENCIA MARTINEZ, THE ALLEGED MASTERMIND OF THE CRIME, OFFERED 50 MILLION PESOS TO POLICE OFFICIALS IN AN ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN THE RELEASE OF SIX PERSONS WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED IN A LUXURY APARTMENT IN BOGOTA. VALENCIA IS ALSO CHARGED WITH BEING THE OWNER OF THE MACHINEGUN THAT WAS FOUND IN THE APARTMENT IN WHICH THE SIX SUSPECTS WERE ARRESTED. THE DEFENSE CLAIMS THAT THERE IS A SWORN STATEMENT BY FORMER MINISTER CARLOS OBANDO VELASCO THAT CERTIFIES THAT HE WAS WITH JUBIS HAZVUMB ON THE DAY GALAN WAS KILLED. THE LAWYERS ALSO CLAIM THAT GALAN SARMIENTO WAS KILLED BY AN UZI SUBMACHINEGUN AND THAT THE ONE FOUND AT THE APARTMENT WHERE THE SIX SUSPECTS WERE ARRESTED WAS AN INGRAM. BALLISTIC TEST RESULTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN REVEALED. THE DEFENSE LAWYERS HAVE APPEALED THE COURT DECISION, AND NOW THE COURT WILL HAVE TO DECIDE IF THE DECISION ISSUED BY THE THIRD PUBLIC JUDGE IS TO STAND.
DEV-MUC3-0484	BOGOTA, 14 SEP 89 -- THE FRG EMBASSY IN BOGOTA TODAY REJECTED A REPORT THAT SOME OF ITS OFFICIALS ARE LINKED TO THE POWERFUL DRUG TRAFFICKING MAFIAS THAT OPERATE IN COLOMBIA. THE REPORT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE GERMAN WEEKLY "WELT AM SONNTAG," WHICH BASED ITS INFORMATION ON FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS OFFICE SOURCES WHO STATED THAT SOME OFFICIALS IN THE DIPLOMATIC MISSION ASSIGNED TO BOGOTA ARE LINKED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING AND HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE OPERATIONS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, THE BIGGEST DRUG TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATION IN THE WORLD. AN FRG EMBASSY SPOKESMAN WHO WAS QUESTIONED BY DPA SAID: "WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT A MISSION MEMBER WHO HAS BEEN LINKED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING." ACCORDING TO THE GERMAN PUBLICATION, APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION OBTAINED BY THE MEDELLIN CARTEL FOR THEIR ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED FROM BANKS IN COLOMBIA TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN PANAMA AND LUXEMBOURG. LAST WEEK, THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAS DECLARED "WAR" ON THE COCAINE GANGS, EXTRADITED TO THE UNITED STATES EDUARDO MARTINEZ ROMERO, THE ALLEGED "FINANCIAL HEAD" OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL. ROMERO IS ACCUSED OF BEING THE "BRAIN" BEHIND THE CARTEL'S MONEY-LAUNDERING OPERATIONS. AT PRESENT, MARTINEZ ROMERO IS BEING CHARGED AT AN ATLANTA COURT FOR ALLEGEDLY LAUNDERING MORE THAN $1.2 BILLION IN THE BANCO DE OCCIDENTE DE PANAMA. ACCORDING TO "WELT AM SONNTAG," THIS BANK SENT THE DRUG TRAFFICKING FUNDS TO THE DEUTSCH-SUEDAMERIKANISCHE BANK. THE DRUG TRAFFICKER'S EXTRADITION HAS CAUSED TENSION AND ANXIETY IN COLOMBIA BECAUSE THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE WHEREIN THEY THREATENED TO KILL 10 JUDGES FOR EACH COLOMBIAN SENT TO ANOTHER COUNTRY. THE FRG EMBASSY SPOKESMAN ADDED THAT THE ALLEGED LINKS OF EMBASSY OFFICIALS WITH THE MAFIA "WERE INVENTED BY A NEWS AGENCY -- NOT DPA -- THAT WROTE THE INFORMATION IN BONN." THE INFORMATION WAS LATER PUBLISHED BY "WELT AM SONNTAG," WHICH, THE SPOKESMAN SAID, WAS A NEWSPAPER "THAT WAS NOT VERY IMPORTANT." SO FAR, THE "WAR" BEING CARRIED OUT BY COLOMBIAN OFFICIALS HAS LED TO THE CAPTURE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO ARE CONNECTED TO THE DRUG CARTEL AND THE CONFISCATION OF NUMEROUS PROPERTIES BELONGING TO THE "CAPOS" PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA AND GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, THE BIGGEST MAFIOSOS IN THE WORLD, ACCORDING TO WASHINGTON AND BOGOTA.
DEV-MUC3-0485	GUATEMALA CITY, NO DATE -- THE SETTING OF EXPLOSIVE DEVICES AND THE KIDNAPPINGS ARE AN ATTEMPT BY SOME TO GIVE THE GOVERNMENT JUSTIFICATION FOR USING A STRONG HAND, PRESIDENT CEREZO SAID. THE PRESIDENT STRESSED THAT THE BOMBS AND THE OF CANDIDATES IS THE WORK OF TERRORISTS. REPORTING THAT THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS WILL BE PRESENTED IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, CEREZO AREVALO URGED CITIZENS TO HELP IN THE EFFORTS TO CONTROL VIOLENCE. "FIRST, WE NEED THE PEOPLE'S WILLINGNESS TO HELP, WHICH IMPLIES HAVING THE COURAGE TO PASS ON INFORMATION TO THE GOVERNMENT, BECAUSE PEOPLE FEAR REPRISALS FROM CRIMINALS. HOWEVER, IF WE ARE NOT ALL UNITED TO FIGHT CRIME AND TERRORISM, WE GUATEMALANS WILL CERTAINLY BE AFFECTED SERIOUSLY IN THE FUTURE BY THIS KIND OF VIOLENCE, WHICH SEEMS TO BE SPREADING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, AS WE HAVE SAID IN THE PAST. "SECOND, I HAVE NOTICED THAT SOME SECTORS HAVE TURNED TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BY REQUESTING THAT HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP REPRESENTATIVES BE SENT HERE, AS IF THE GOVERNMENT . PEOPLE ARE AWARE THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE, YET THEY HOLD THE GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBLE. I BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS TURN TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY -- THE GOVERNMENT WILL DO THIS -- SO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CAN HELP US CONTROL TERRORISM. "THIRD, I MUST RECOGNIZE THAT ONE OF THE PARTIES, THE UNION OF THE NATIONAL CENTER, HAS ADOPTED A POSITIVE ATTITUDE BY MAKING SUGGESTIONS TO THE GOVERNMENT ON HOW TO CONTROL CRIME. WE ARE GOING TO STUDY THEIR PROPOSALS. WE BELIEVE THAT ALTHOUGH THE PROPOSALS COME FROM AN OPPOSITION PARTY, WE SHOULD ANALYZE THEM. WE URGE ALL SECTORS IN GUATEMALAN SOCIETY NOT TO SIMPLY ADOPT THE EASY ATTITUDE OF ACCUSING THE GOVERNMENT. WE SHOULD INSTEAD ADOPT THE ATTITUDE OF REJECTING CRIME." REGARDING THE PROPOSALS HE WILL MAKE DURING HIS UPCOMING VISIT TO THE UN HEARDQUARTERS AND THE RECENT ATTACKS IN GUATEMALA, WHICH HE SAID ARE AIMED AT DESTROYING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS ACHIEVED DURING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, CEREZO AREVALO ADDED: "AMONG THE ISSUES WE ARE GOING TO POINT OUT IS THAT, AT THIS MOMENT, GUATEMALA IS THE TARGET OF AN ATTEMP TO UNDERMINE THE CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY. WE ARE GOING TO NEED THE HELP OF DEMOCRACIES THAT ARE FRIENDS OF GUATEMALA, BUT NOT IN THE CAPACITY OF JUDGES. WE ARE GOING TO NEED TOTAL SUPPORT TO CONTROL A DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST OFFENSIVE THAT IS TAKING PLACE IN THE COUNTRY AND THAT SEEKS TO DESTROY THE REPUBLIC." THERE ARE PEOPLE INTERESTED IN HAVING THE LARGE NUMBER OF REFUGEES WHO HAVE RETURNED TO THE COUNTRY SINCE CEREZO WAS SWORN IN LEAVE THE COUNTRY AGAIN TO DISCREDIT GUATEMALA, PRESIDENT CEREZO SAID. "DURING 3 AND 1/2 YEARS OF DEMOCRACY, IN WHICH WE IMPLEMENTED PLANS AND GUARANTEED THE RIGHTS OF ALL CITIZENS, GUATEMALA BEGAN TO WELCOME ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE: REFUGEES -- GUATEMALANS WHO HAVE BEEN LIVING IN EXILE FOR YEARS IN MEXICO AND OTHER COUNTRIES; PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN THREATENED AND WHO WERE LIVING IN COSTA RICA AND WHO HAVE RETURNED. WE DO NOT EVEN KNOW WHERE THESE PEOPLE WORK BECAUSE, FOR US, THEY ARE GUATEMALANS WHO HAVE RETURNED. HOWEVER, WE ARE BEGINNING TO RECEIVE REPORTS FROM THEM. THEY HAVE TOLD US THEY ARE BEING SYSTEMATICALLY THREATENED OVER THE TELEPHONE. WHO KNOWS WHERE THESE PEOPLE ARE OR HOW THEY GOT THEIR TELEPHONE NUMBERS? HOW IS THIS DONE? THERE ARE PEOPLE INTERESTED IN HAVING THESE FORMER REFUGEES LEAVE THE COUNTRY TO AGAIN REPORT THAT WE ARE VIOLATING HUMAN RIGHTS IN GUATEMALA TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION. I WOULD SAY WE ARE BEING AFFECTED BY TWO TRENDS THAT ARE FIGHTING AGAINST GUATEMALAN DEMOCRACY."
DEV-MUC3-0486	BOGOTA, 15 SEP 89 -- COLOMBIAN AIR FORCE COMMANDOS AND PILOTS TODAY RECEIVED ORDERS TO STAND READY TO TAKE OFF, INTERCEPT, CAPTURE, OR SHOOT DOWN UNIDENTIFIED OR HOSTILE AIRCRAFT FLYING OVER THE NATION'S TERRITORY. THE GOVERNMENT ADOPTED THESE MEASURES IN CONNECTION WITH THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING. HERE IS A REPORT BY AMPARO MONTON: THE ORDER WAS ISSUED BY THE COLOMBIAN AIR FORCE COMMANDS, WHICH ALSO DECIDED TO USE GROUND-TO-AIR MISSILES AND OTHER WEAPONS ABOARD FAC AIRCRAFT. ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS MANUAL SENT TO ALL AIR BASES, ORDERS ARE GIVEN TO CAPTURE, DESTROY, OR SHOOT DOWN PLANES IN 11 INSTANCES, WHICH INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: WHEN PLANES FLY OVER FORBIDDEN OR RESTRICTED AREAS; IN THE EVENT OF UNAUTHORIZED LANDINGS; WHEN THE DO NOT ESTABLISH RADIO CONTACT WITH THE INTERCEPTOR PLANE FLYING OVER THEM; WHEN AIRCRAFT LAND IN PLACES NOT AUTHORIZED BY THE CIVIL AERONAUTICS OFFICE; WHEN THEY LAND ON CLANDESTINE AIRSTRIPS. INSTRUCTIONS WERE ALSO ISSUED TO ALL AIR COMMANDS TO KEEP TWO ARMORED AIRCRAFT ON ALERT AT ALL TIMES EITHER ON THE GROUND OR IN THE AIR. THE ONLY EVENT IN WHICH THE SHOOTING DOWN OF A HOSTILE AIRCRAFT MUST NOT BE CONSIDERED IS WHEN SUCH AN ACTION WOULD ENDANGER INNOCENT PEOPLE OR OCCUPIED BUILDINGS. IN ADDITION, THE FAC COMMAND DIVIDED THE PROCEDURE INTO FOUR PHASES, NAMELY: DETECTION, IDENTIFICATION, INTERCEPTION, AND DESTRUCTION. THESE MEASURES WILL APPLY TO ALL SUSPICIOUS-LOOKING AIRCRAFT, INCLUDING PLANES OF COLOMBIAN OR FOREIGN REGISTRY.
DEV-MUC3-0487	BOGOTA, 16 SEP 89 -- BANKS WERE THE TARGETS THIS AFTERNOON OF NEW TERRORIST ATTACKS IN BOGOTA. UNTIL THEN, IT WAS A QUIET AFTERNOON ON THIS DAY OF FRIENDSHIP AND LOVE. TWO DYNAMITE CHARGES WERE DETONATED NEAR THE DAS OFFICES IN THE PALO QUEMAO NEIGHBORHOOD, DESTROYING THE BRANCH OFFICES OF THE BANCO POPULAR AND THE BANCO SANTANDER. TWO PERSONS WERE SLIGHTLY INJURED AND DAMAGE IS ESTIMATED AT OVER 100 MILLION PESOS. THE TWO BOMBS EXPLODED AT APPROXIMATELY 1700 IN THE BRANCH OFFICES OF TWO BANKS, IN PALO QUEMAO, JUST TWO BLOCKS FROM THE DAS OFFICES. THE EXPLOSION OF 17 KG OF DYNAMITE DESTROYED THE BANK BRANCHES AND DAMAGED 20 NEIGHBORING STORES. THE AUTHORITIES ARE CARRYING OUT A VAST OPERATION THROUGHOUT BOGOTA TO FIND THE INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ATTACK.
DEV-MUC3-0488	BOGOTA, 16 SEP 89 -- IN CALI, NINE PERSONS WERE INJURED AND THERE IS CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE FOLLOWING LAST NIGHT'S TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST SOME BANK BRANCHES. SEVERAL CHARGES OF DYNAMITE WERE DETONATED IN SEVERAL BANKS LOCATED IN DOWNTOWN CALI, CAPITAL OF VALLE DEL CAUCA DEPARTMENT. TWO MILITARY SECURITY OFFICERS ARE AMONG THE WOUNDED. THESE BANKS WERE THE TARGETS OF TERRORIST EXPLOSIVE ATTACKS LAST NIGHT IN CALI. THEY ARE THE BANCO DE SANTANDER IN NORTHEASTERN CALI AND THE LA VIVIENDA CORPORATION NEAR CAICEDO SQUARE, IN THE BANKING AND COMMERCIAL SECTOR OF CALI. THE METROPOLITAN POLICE COMMAND HAS DECIDED TO RESTRICT TO QUARTERS ALL CALI POLICEMEN. I REQUEST THAT THE CITIZENS COOPERATE WITH THE METROPOLITAN POLICE AND PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION THEY MAY HAVE WHICH COULD HELP EFFECTIVELY CONTROL THESE TERRORIST ACTIONS. DAMAGE IS ESTIMATED AT 50 MILLION PESOS.
DEV-MUC3-0489	MOSCOW , NO DATE -- DURING THE LAST 3 WEEKS IN COLOMBIA, YOU KNOW, A REAL WAR HAS BEEN GOING ON, A WAR BEING WAGED BY THE GOVERNMENT ON THE DRUGS MAFIA. IN BOGOTA, MEDELLIN, CALI, AND OTHER TOWNS SHOTS ARE HEARD, BOMBS EXPLODE, BLOOD IS FLOWING, AND MORE AND MORE OFTEN WE HEAR THE WORDS THE MEDELLIN CARTEL. THIS IS THE HEART OF THE COLOMBIAN MAFIA. WHAT IS IT? HOW DID IT FORM? WITH THIS QUESTION I TURN TO YOU, YURIY NIKOLAYEVICH. INCIDENTALLY, I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN IN MEDELLIN. YES, WHILE WORKING IN LATIN AMERICA AS A CORRESPONDENT FOR USSR STATE TELEVISION AND RADIO I WAS ABLE TO VISIT MEDELLIN ONCE. THERE WAS A SEMINAR THERE ON THE PROBLEMS OF CENTRAL AMERICA. OUTWARDLY IT IS A VERY ATTRACTIVE TOWN, VERY GREEN, SITUATED ON A PLAIN, AND IT IS CALLED ETERNALLY BLOSSOMING. AFTER SEVERAL HOURS IN MEDELLIN BURSTS OF SUBMACHINEGUN FIRE RANG OUT SUDDENLY IN THE STREETS AND I UNDERSTOOD THEN THAT I WAS IN THE CENTER OF THE COCAINE MAFIA. TWO CLANS OF BANDITS WERE EXCHANGING FIRE AND PASSERS-BY LITERALLY HAD TO RUN AWAY FROM THE SCENE OF EVENTS AS FAST AS THEY COULD. LOCAL COLLEAGUES SHOWED ME A HUGE DISTRICT CONSISTING OF LUXURIOUS VILLAS WHERE THE GODFATHERS OF THE COLOMBIA DRUG MAFIA LIVE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO EVEN APPROACH THESE HOUSES: THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY BARBED WIRE AND THERE ARE VIDEO CAMERAS AND WATCH TOWERS. IF YOU DECIDE TO GO FAIRLY CLOSE THE GUARDS WILL OPEN FIRE WITHOUR WARNING. I WAS ALSO ABLE TO SEE A NINETEENTH-CENTURY CASTLE, A RARE AND EXTREMELY BEAUTIFUL BUILDING, A GENUINE ARCHITECTURAL MONUMENT. THIS CASTLE BELONGS TO ONE OF THE HEADS OF THE MAFIA, CARLOS LEHDER. YES, YURIY NIKOLAEVICH, BUT HOW WAS THE MEDELLIN CARTEL FORMED? SOME INFORMATION ON ITS HISTORY, IF YOU COULD. BY RIGHTS THE FOUNDER OF THE CARTEL IS CONSIDERED TO BE CARLOS ENRIQUE LEHDER, WHO WAS ABLE TO UNITE THE COCAINE MAFIA OF COLOMBIA AROUND HIM AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEVENTIES. A FEW WORDS ABOUT LEHDER HIMSELF: HE IS A DESPERATE EXTREMIST WHO HOLDS NOTHING SACRED. HE HAS HUNDREDS OF HUMAN LIVES ON HIS CONSCIENCE. IT IS NOT FOR NOTHING THAT HIS FRIENDS GAVE HIM AT VARIOUS TIMES THE NICK NAMES RUM ROBIN HOOD, THE DRUGS BARON, AND SO ON. CARLOS LEHDER IS DISTINGUISHED FOR HIS AUDACITY AND A RESTLESS DISPOSITION. TOGETHER WITH HIM OTHER COLOMBIAN FAMILIES HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED IN THIS ADVANTAGEOUS BUSINESS, NAMELY THE OCHOA AND ESCOBAR FAMILIES. AT THE END OF THE EIGHTIES A COCAINE WAR BEGAN BETWEEN THESE THREE CLANS. LATER, HOWEVER, THEY CAME TO AN AGREEMENT AND THE MEDELLIN CARTEL WAS FORMED IN THE PRESS MANY REPORTS HAVE APPEARED STATING THAT LITERALLY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS PASS THROUGH THE HANDS OF THE CARTEL. IS THIS TRUE? THE CARTEL'S ANNUAL INCOME, AS THE PRESS CLAIMS, IS $8 BILLION. TO SKETCH THE SCALE OF COCAINE OPERATIONS I WILL REMIND YOU THAT IN 1984, FOR EXAMPLE, THE CARTEL BIGWIGS PROPOSED TO THE GOVERNMENT TO CLEAR COLOMBIA'S ENTIRE FOREIGN DEBT WITHIN A WEEK -- AND I WILL REMIND YOU THAT THIS IS $9 BILLION -- IF THE GOVERNMENT WOULD RELEASE MAFIA MEMBERS WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED. NOT VERY LONG AGO A WEST GERMAN MAGAZINE PUBLISHED A LIST OF THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD AND ONE OF THE HEADS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL -- JORGE OCHOA -- IS BY NO MEANS LAST ON THAT LIST. I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION ANOTHER CASE THAT CHARACTERIZES THE DIMENSIONS OF THE DRUG MAFIA'S MEANS. FOUR YEARS AGO IT CAME TO LIGHT THAT THE CARTEL HAD TAKEN PART IN NEGOTIATIONS ON BUYING A WHOLE CONSIGNMENT OF SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES, SEVERAL MILITARY HELICOPTERS, AND OTHER MODERN WEAPONS. HOW IS THIS LETHAL ARSENAL USED? IT IS COMPLETELY NATURAL THAT THE CARTEL COULD NOT EXIST WITHOUT A COMPLETE ARMY OF MERCENARY KILLERS AND INFORMANTS WHO HAVE PENETRATED INTO LITERALLY ALL SPHERES OF THE COLOMBIAN ECONOMY, PARLIAMENT, AND THE ARMY. THE MAIN TARGET OF THE MAFIOSI ARE PROGRESSIVE POLITICIANS, WHO IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THREATEN THE DRUGS BUSINESS. I WILL REMIND YOU THAT THE SAME CARLOS LEHDER IN 1984 ORGANIZED THE ASSASSINATION OF LARA BONILLA, THE COLOMBIAN MINISTER OF JUSTICE. IN 1986 GUILLERMO CANO, THE DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRESSIVE NEWSPAPER EL ESPECTADOR WAS MURDERED, AND IT WAS BASICALLY AFTER THIS MUDER THAT THE HUNT FOR LEHDER BEGAN. IN THE SAME YEAR HE WAS ARRESTED AND HANDED OVER TO U.S. JUSTICE, WHICH SENTENCED HIM TO LIFE IMPRISONMENT. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT THERE EXISTS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE U.S. AND COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENTS ON THE EXTRADITION OF ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS CRIMINALS. IF WE TAKE THE PRESENT WAR -- IT CANNOT BE CALLED ANYTHING ELSE -- WHAT WERE ITS IMMEDIATE CAUSES?
DEV-MUC3-0490	BOGOTA, 17 SEP 89 -- TWO BOMBS EXPLODED A FEW MINUTES AGO IN THE CHAPINERO NEIGHBORHOOD IN BOGOTA. THE EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE IN A BRANCH OFFICE OF THE COLMENA CORPORATION ON 59TH STREET AND 9TH AVENUE. THIS NEW TERRORIST ACTION HAS LEFT A TOLL OF 1 PERSON WOUNDED AND MATERIAL DAMAGE TO OVER 20 STORES IN THE AREA. UNFORTUNATELY, A NEW TERRORIST ACTION HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE CAPITAL CITY OF THE REPUBLIC. THE FIRST EXPLOSION OCCURRED ON 59TH STREET, BETWEEN 13TH AND 7TH AVENUES. THE SECOND EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE AT A BANK BRANCH ON 60TH STREET AND 7TH AVENUE. THE FIRST EXPLOSION, AS YOU CAN NOW SEE, WENT OFF AT THE CONAVI BRANCH, CLOSE TO THE OFFICES OF THE SOCIAL SAVINGS FUND. THIS BANK WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED. WE NOW SEE THE WORK BEING DONE BY THE BOGOTA FIRE DEPARTMENT. AN OPERATION IS BEING CONDUCTED ON 60TH STREET AND 7TH AVENUE, WHERE THE SECOND BOMB EXPLODED. ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES, NO ONE WAS HURT IN THIS NEW TERRORIST ACTION.
DEV-MUC3-0491	BOGOTA, 17 SEP 89 -- THE COLOMBIAN POLICE REPORTED THAT A HOMEMADE ROCKET WAS LAUNCHED AT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE U.S. EMBASSY IN BOGOTA THIS EVENING. NO INJURIES OR DAMAGE WERE REPORTED. THE ROCKET PARTIALLY PERFORATED ONE OF THE WALLS OF THE EMBASSY, BUT DID NOT EXPLODE. THE ALREADY TIGHT SECURITY SURROUNDING THE EMBASSY SINCE THE WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFIC WAS DECLARED WAS STEPPED UP IMMEDIATELY AND TRAFFIC AND PEDESTRIANS WERE KEPT OUT OF THE AREA. THIS ATTACKED FOLLOWED THE TWO DYNAMITE EXPLOSIONS THAT OCCURRED EARLY SUNDAY EVENING IN THE NORTHERN AREA OF BOGOTA WHERE ONE PERSON WAS SLIGHTLY INJURED AND APPROXIMATELY 30 LOCALS WERE DAMAGED. DURING THE BELISARIO BETACUR ADMINISTRATION , WHEN SEVERAL COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE EXTRADITED TO THE UNITED STATES, THE U.S. EMBASSY WAS ATTACKED IN A SIMILAR MANNER. NO INJURIES WERE REPORTED DURING THAT ATTACK. LATER, HOWEVER, A BOMB EXPLODED IN THE EMBASSY'S PARKING LOT KILLING A COLOMBIAN WOMAN WHO WAS STANDING IN LINE TO GET A VISA. LIKE IN OTHER ATTACKS OF THIS KIND REPORTED OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS IN BOGOTA AND IN OTHER CITIES, NO ORGANIZATION HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ATTACK; HOWEVER, THE PRESS AND THE AUTHORITIES ARE BLAMING PERSONS IN THE SERVICE OF THE DRUG LORDS.
DEV-MUC3-0492	DHAKA , 9 SEP 89 -- PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH HAS DECLARED HIS COUNTRY'S WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN A DRAMATIC MANNER, COMMITTING A MASSIVE FUND OF $7.86 BILLION FOR THE PROGRAMME, PROVIDING INCREASED POWERS TO LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND EVEN OFFERING SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO OTHER COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY IN LATIN AMERICA, FIGHTING THIS MENACE. TO DEAL WITH WHAT HE CALLED, "AMERICA'S TOUGHEST DOMESTIC TEST IN DECADES" DURING HIS STERN ADDRESS ON TUESDAY, THE US LEADER HAS GIVEN A NEW BOOST TO THE CONTINUING INTERNATIONAL CRUSADE AGAINST NARCOTICS. THIS NEW INITIATIVE WILL BE WARMLY WELCOMED BY THE WORLD COMMUNITY, MOST OF ALL BY LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY COLOMBIA WHICH IS FIGHTING A DESPERATE BATTLE AGAINST COCAINE BARONS. THE NEWS FROM BOGOTA IS SIMPLY FRIGHTENING. IN THE COUNTRY'S LONG WAR AGAINST DRUG DEALERS, NOTHING LIKE WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW -- THE MERCILESS KILLING OF SECURITY OFFICERS AND THEIR RELATIVES -- HAS EVER HAPPENED BEFORE. SHOULD COLOMBIA LOSE THIS WAR AGAINST COCAINE BARONS, DRUG LORDS IN OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES WILL FLEX THEIR MUSCLES TOO. TO PUT IT PLAINLY, COLOMBIA CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE THIS WAR. BUT WHETHER SHE WINS OR LOSSES THIS BATTLE DEPENDS ON WHAT ASSISTANCE THE UNITED STATES CAN PROVIDE TO THIS LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY. HERE, COLOMBIA FACES DIFFICULT OPTIONS. WHILE SHE HAS ACCEPTED SOME LOGISTIC SUPPORT, SUCH AS HELICOPTERS, FROM WASHINGTON, SHE MAINTAINS HERE OPPOSITION TO THE USE OF US TROOPS IN TACKLING WHAT SHE RIGHTLY REGARDS AS A DOMESTIC CRISIS. THE STATEMENT BY MR BUSH ON WEDNESDAY HAS SO FAR MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THIS OPPOSITION. THE PROBLEM FACING BOGOTA IS, WHILE AN INCREASE IN THE LOGISTIC SUPPORT FROM US WOULD HELP, THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT OVERNIGHT RAISE THE STRENGTH OF ITS ANI-NARCOTIC SECURITY FORCES. WITH THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OFFERED BY THE UNITED STATES, BOGOTA CAN, OF COURSE, BUY ARMS FOR USE AGAINST DRUG BARONS. BUT THE BATTLE WILL STILL BE HARD AND LONG. IN FIGHTING THIS RELENTLESS BATTLE AGAINST COCAINE DEALERS, COLOMBIA HAS MADE ONE PERFECTLY VALID POINT, MORE THAN ONCE. TRUE, IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA TO WIN ITS INTERNAL WAR, WITH ALL THE HELP THAT WASHINGTON CAN PROVIDE. BUT THE REAL BATTLE AGAINST DRUG DEALERS MUST BE FOUGHT WITHIN THE UNITED STATES, ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK, WASHINGTON, CHICAGO AND ALL OTHER CITIES. THIS IS THE MARKET FOR THE COCAINE BARONS OF COLOMBIA OR FOR THE DRUGS PRODUCED IN THE INFAMOUS GOLDEN TRIANGLE IN ASIA. AND IT IS ALSO WITHIN THE UNITED STATES WHERE ALL THE CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION, SOME CONTROLLED BY US CITIZENS, THRIVE UNDER THE EYES OF THE US LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MAY ASK IF ENOUGH HAS BEEN DONE TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM AT THE US END. THIS STATEMENT BY MR BUSH SUGGESTS THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION HAS RECOGNISED THIS BASIC PROBLEM AND WANTS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. A MAJOR PORTION OF THE FUNDING SUPPORT FOR THE ANTI-DRUG WAR WILL BE USED IN STRENGTHENING THE LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. BUT QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED BY MEMBERS OF THE US CONGRESS WHETHER THE PRESIDENT HAS GONE FAR ENOUGH IN THAT DIRECTION. IN FACT, THERE IS SOME DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN HAS NOT BEEN "BOLD ENOUGH" EITHER. WHILE ONE MUST ADMIT THAT THE US CONGRESSMEN ARE USED TO MAKING SUCH CRITICISMS AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATION ON PROBLEM ON WHICH THEY THEMSELVES RARELY OFFER ANY NEW INITIATIVE, ONE HOPES THAT THE US ADMINISTRATION WILL KEEP ITS NEWLY-UNVEILED ANTI-DRUG PLAN UNDER CONSTANT SCRUTINY AND ENSURE THAT THE BATTLE THAT COLOMBIA IS BEING URGED TO WIN AT ALL COSTS IS NOT LOST WITHIN THE UNITED STATES.
DEV-MUC3-0493	RIO DE JANEIRO , 17 SEP 89 -- YESTERDAY MORNING, 27 PEOPLE WERE DETAINED AND MORE THAN 30 STOLEN CARS WERE SEIZED IN VARIOUS PARTS OF VITORIA DURING A HUGE OPERATION CONDUCTED BY THE FEDERAL POLICE DEPARTMENT . THE OPERATION DISMANTLED THE "ESPIRITO SANTO-BOLIVIA CONNECTION," WHICH CONSISTED OF EXCHANGING CARS THAT HAD BEEN STOLEN IN VITORIA FOR BOLIVIAN OR COLOMBIAN COCAINE. THE "MARSEILLE OPERATION," AS THE OPERATION WAS CALLED, INVOLVED 70 POLICEMENT. THE OPERATION WAS COORDINATED BY THE RIO DE JANEIRO, SAO PAULO, AND ESPIRITO SANTO DPF. THE OPERATION'S MAIN OBJECTIVE -- THE ARREST OF STOLEN- CAR DEALER JOAO LUIZ DE SOUZA -- WAS NOT ACHIEVED, HOWEVER, BECAUSE, ALTHOUGH HAVING BEEN SURROUNDED BY SIX ARMED POLICEMEN, SOUZA MANAGED TO ESCAPE.
DEV-MUC3-0494	BOGOTA, 18 SEP 89 -- THIS IS A LAST-MINUTE REPORT: TWO MORE EXPLOSIONS HAVE TAKEN PLACE JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO IN BOGOTA. ONE BOMB EXPLODED IN WESTERN BOGOTA, ON BOYACA AVENUE AND ELDORADO AVENUE, WHILE THE OTHER OCCURRED AT THE TELEPHONE COMPANY SUBSTATION IN THE NORMANDY NEIGHBORHOOD. A WATCHMAN FIRED SHOTS AT THE TIME OF THE ATTACK, AND IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE ATTACKERS, WHO ARE RIDING IN A GREEN MAZDA, ARE WOUNDED.
DEV-MUC3-0495	HAVANA , NO DATE -- I BELIEVE THAT MANY HAVE BEEN PREPARING THEMSELVES DURING THE LAST YEARS. WHATEVER COURSE HISTORY MAY TAKE IN THE FUTURE, WE KNOW THAT HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS HAVE PREPARED THEMSELVES, AND WE KNOW THAT IN THEIR WISDOM THE CHILEAN PEOPLE WILL NOT ALLOW SUCH A SAD HISTORY TO BE REPEATED, BE WHENEVER IT MAY. WE HAVE NOT SOWN IN THE DESERT OR PLOWED AT SEA. THESE PAST 16 YEARS REPRESENT AN EXPERIENCE WHOSE VALUE IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO ASSESS. IT IS CLEAR THAT IMPORTANT STEPS FORWARD HAVE BEEN TAKEN. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE PLEBISCITE WAS UNQUESTIONABLY A STEP FORWARD. I REMEMBER THE DAY WE UNVEILED ALLENDE'S BUST AT THE HOSPITAL. I EXPRESSED THE CERTAINTY THAT THE CHILEAN PEOPLE WOULD VOTE AGAINST PINOCHET, DESPITE PINOCHET'S RESOURCES AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE AND TERRORIST METHODS THAT WERE USED TO INTIMIDATE THE MASSES. IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR A PEOPLE TO FORGET THE MANY CRIMES AND MONSTROSITIES THAT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE. IN EFFECT, THE PLEBISCITE WAS A HARSH BLOW FOR PINOCHET. I THINK ALSO THAT THE ELECTIONS WILL BE AN EXTREMELY HARSH BLOW, PERHAPS AN IRREVERSIBLE BLOW, TO PINOCHET. HOWEVER, IT IS A FACT THAT NOBODY CAN ASSERT HERE THAT PINOCHET'S DEFEAT IN THE ELECTION WILL BE THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF THE DICTATORSHIP IN CHILE. I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT A REVOLUTION. I THINK IT WOULD BE UNNECESSARY. THERE WOULD BE NO SENSE IN TALKING HERE ABOUT A REVOLUTION A STAGE ABOVE THE DEMOCRATIC OPENING. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A DEMOCRATIC OPENING, BUT THE ELECTORAL VICTORY DOES NOT ENTAIL A SOLID DEMOCRATIC OPENING YET. HOWEVER, IN OUR OPINION IT WILL UNDOUBTEDLY REPRESENT ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD. PINOCHET WILL TRY TO STAY ON AS HEAD OF THE ARMY AND AS HEAD OF THE ARMED FORCES. WE COULD ALMOST SAY THAT HE WILL STAY ON AS A SORT OF SENTINEL, A POWER ON WHICH THE COUNTRY'S DESTINY WOULD CONTINUE TO HANG FOR SOME TIME TO COME. WHETHER HE CAN REALLY FULFILL THE GOALS HE HAS SET FOR HIMSELF REMAINS TO BE SEEN. HOWEVER, I AM CERTAIN HE WILL NOT GIVE UP POWER WITHOUT A STRUGGLE. ONLY THE CHILEAN PEOPLE CAN MAKE THIS AN IRREVERSIBLE STRUGGLE TO ACHIEVE A TRUE AND FULL DEMOCRATIC OPENING, AN OPENING WITHOUT ALL OF THE LIMITATIONS THAT THE REGIME HAS WRITTEN INTO ITS CONSTITUTION, WHICH GRANTS HIM ALL OF THESE RIGHTS -- TO BE A SENATOR FOR LIFE, AND, IF MY MEMORY DOES NOT FAIL ME, TO SERVE AS CHIEF OF THE ARMY FOR AN ADDITIONAL 8 YEARS. LOOK AT HIS HARANGUES. HIS HARANGUES ARE STILL AGGRESSIVE, HAUGHTY, AND THREATENING. WE HEAR WARNINGS. WE HEAR APPEALS TO THE ARMY TO REMAIN UNITED, BECAUSE HE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY TRY TO PERPETUATE HIMSELF. I THINK HE WILL BE MORE AND MORE CORNERED BY THE CHILEAN PEOPLE, BECAUSE A NEW STAGE WILL BEGIN AFTER THE ELECTIONS. IT IS INEVITABLE THAT THE PEOPLE WILL PARTICIPATE TO A MUCH GREATER EXTENT. THEY WILL INEVITABLY HAVE A MUCH GREATER POSSIBILITY OF EXPRESSING THEMSELVES, OF ACTING, OF MOBILIZING, OF THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AT THE MOMENT AND NOT ABOUT SHARES OF POWER. I THINK THEY HAVE TO BE... THAT THIS IS REALLY AN ADMIRABLE TEST OF PATRIOTIC AND REVOLUTIONARY FEELING FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT RIGHTISTS, FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT CONSERVATIVES, FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT EVEN IN THE CENTER BUT ON THE LEFT, AND WELL TO THE LEFT: TO GO TO THE POLLS AND TO VOTE, FORGETTING WHICH PARTY IT WAS THAT PUT FORWARD THE CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT, OR WHAT THE CANDIDATE'S POLITICAL THINKING IS, JUST THINKING OF CHILE, ONLY THINKING OF CHILE.
DEV-MUC3-0496	BUENOS AIRES, 19 SEP 89 -- VICE PRESIDENT EDUARDO DUHALDE SAID TODAY THAT THE PROBLEM CREATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN COLOMBIA "CANNOT" OCCUR IN ARGENTINA BECAUSE IN COLOMBIA THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS PRACTICALLY CREATED A "PARALLEL GOVERNMENT WITH THE IDEA OF TAKING POWER." DUHALDE SUPPORTS THE IDEA OF "SENDING TROOPS TO THAT COUNTRY IF ITS LEADERS REQUEST THEM" BECAUSE IN COLOMBIA THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS NOT ONLY BUY "LARGE ENTERPRISES, COMPANIES, BANKS, AND OFFICES," BUT ALSO "HAVE THEIR OWN POLITICIANS, POLICEMEN, TEACHERS, AND OFFICIALS." IN AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH NA DUHALDE CALLED ON SOCIETY TO THE "PREVENT" DRUG ADDICTION IN ARGENTINA. THE COLOMBIAN SITUATION "IS A MILITARY ISSUE BECAUSE A REAL WAR IS TAKING PLACE," DUHALDE SAID. HE ADDED THAT COLOMBIA IS "DIVIDED INTO TWO COUNTRIES: THE LEGAL COUNTRY AND THE ONE RUN BY NARCOTICS." HE SAID, "I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE LEGAL WILL WIN." ACCORDING TO DUHALDE WHAT IS TAKING PLACE IN COLOMBIA "CANNOT OCCUR IN ARGENTINA FOR SEVERAL DECADES." HE SAID THAT HE PERSONALLY SUPPORTS THE IDEA OF "SENDING TROOPS TO COLOMBIA IF ITS LEADERS REQUEST THEM." HOWEVER, HE EXPLAINED: "THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT HAS TO BE RESOLVED BY CONGRESS." HE POINTED OUT THAT "DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARE UNDOUBTEDLY OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY BUT THEIR NATIONALITIES ARE NOT KNOWN." HE ADDED THAT "THERE IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT DISTRIBUTES THE DRUG IN ARGENTINA." DUHALDE SAID: "WHAT IS TAKING PLACE IN COLOMBIA IS A CLEAR EXAMPLE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE CONTINENT -- THE PRODUCTION AND TRAFFICKING OF DRUGS." HE ADDED: "DRUGS ARE NOT PRODUCED IN ARGENTINA. THEY ARE BROUGHT FROM COLOMBIA, BOLIVIA, AND PERU." HE SAID: "IN 1988 IN MY BOOK 'POLITICIANS AND DRUGS' I WARNED ABOUT THE CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS CLOSELY LINKED TO TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS SHINING PATH IN PERU AND M-19 IN COLOMBIA." DUHALDE INDICATED THAT "THE STRUGGLE IS AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND THEIR SUPPORTERS. IDEOLOGIES ARE NOT INVOLVED HERE BECAUSE, FOR EXAMPLE, IN COLOMBIA THE TRAFFICKERS ARE OF THE EXTREME RIGHT -- NATIONALISTS." HE ADDED THAT "THE DRUG ADDICTION PROBLEM IN ARGENTINA INVOLVES YOUTHS FROM 13 TO 20 YEARS OF AGE" AND THAT THAT IS WHY "PREVENTION MEASURES SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS, WHERE WE SHOULD TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT THE ILLS DRUGS CAUSE." DUHALDE, WHO IS GOING TO TOUR THE COUNTRY TO LECTURE ON "HOW TO PREVENT DRUG ADDICTION," SAID THAT "IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO INCLUDE THAT ISSUE IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, BECAUSE TEACHERS CAN BECOME THE REAL FORCE FOR ENDING DRUG ADDICTION." HE REVEALED THAT COCAINE CONSUMPTION IN THE COUNTRY IS COMING CLOSE TO MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION, WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN HIGHER." HE SAID THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO CREATE "VERY HARSH REGULATIONS," SUCH AS THE DEATH PENALTY, "FOR PEOPLE WHO COMMIT HOMICIDES AS THEY ARE DOING IN COLOMBIA." REGARDING THE CHAOTIC COLOMBIAN SITUATION, DUHALDE SAID: "DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARE A SORT OF PARALLEL GOVERNMENT THAT AIMS TO TAKE POWER. I BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THIS WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE EVEN IF THEY HAVE THEIR OWN POLITICIANS, POLICEMEN, TEACHERS, AND OFFICIALS." HE SAID: "THIS IS NOT ONLY A COLOMBIAN PROBLEM; IT IS A CONTINENTAL PROBLEM THAT NO ONE CAN SOLVE ALONE, NOT EVEN THE UNITED STATES. THAT IS WHY JOINT ACTION IS NECESSARY TO ELIMINATE THOSE TRAFFICKERS IN DEATH." REGARDING HIS RECENT TRIP TO THE UNITED STATES, DUHALDE SAID THAT HIS TALKS "DID NOT INCLUDE POSSIBLE U.S. MILITARY AID TO THE COUNTRIES WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEMS, BECAUSE THE COLOMBIAN SITUATION HAD NOT YET DEVELOPED TO ITS CURRENT STAGE." HE CALLED THE COLOMBIAN CARTELS "MAFIA GANGS" THAT ARE "TRYING TO SET UP A DISTRIBUTION NETWORK" FOR THEIR MERCHANDISE WHICH GIVES THEM A PROFIT OF ABOUT $150 BILLION A YEAR ON SALES OF $500 BILLION." DUHALDE SAID THAT "THE DRUG LORDS BUY LARGE ENTERPRISES, COMPANIES, BANKS, AND OFFICES. THEY ALSO FORM RELATIONS WITH POLITICIANS AND MILITARY MEN." HE ADDED THAT "THEY HAVE A GREAT ABILITY TO CORRUPT," AND "THEY SETTLE IN ONE PLACE WHEN THEY ARE SURE THEY WILL NOT BE ARRESTED."
DEV-MUC3-0497	HAVANA , 16 SEP 89 -- FOR THE FIRST TIME IN VIRTUALLY 10 YEARS OF ARMED CONFLICT, WHICH HAS CLAIMED ALMOST 70,000 LIVES, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND GUERRILLAS SIGNED AN AGREEMENT RECENTLY IN MEXICO CITY. THIS COULD MARK THE BEGINNING OF AN UNPRECEDENTED PATH OF PEACE FOR THAT CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY. AFTER 2 DAYS OF TALKS, FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT REPRESENTATIVES AND SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DELEGATES AGREED TO ESTABLISH A PERMANENT DIALOGUE TO SECURE A DEFINITE CEASE-FIRE. ON 16 AND 17 OCTOBER, THE COSTA RICAN CAPITAL WILL HOST THE MEETING BETWEEN THE NEGOTIATING PARTIES. THE EVENT WILL BE ATTENDED BY TWO REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AS MEDIATORS FOR THE SALVADORAN EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE. UN AND OAS REPRESENTATIVES WILL BE INVITED TO ATTEND AS WITNESSES. ASIDE FROM MATTERS OF PROCEDURE, IT IS WORTHWHILE TO SAY THAT, IN ADDITION TO BEING DECISIVE IN ACHIEVING A SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN INTERNAL CRISIS, THE REBELS' RECENT PEACE INITIATIVE WAS A STRONG BLOW TO THE RULING ULTRA-RIGHTIST SECTOR. THE REBELS' WILLINGNESS TO END HOSTILITIES AND TURN THE FMLN INTO A POLITICAL PARTY PLACED BEFORE PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI THE DECISION OF CONTINUING THE WAR OR OPTING FOR PEACE. AS OF THAT MOMENT, AND IN VIEW OF THE IMPORTANCE ASSIGNED TO THE TALKS BY THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA AND ANALYSTS, INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION KEPT ABREAST OF THE DIALOGUE, WHICH IS SO VITAL FOR EL SALVADOR AND FOR CENTRAL AMERICA. FOR THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE , THE PROPOSALS WERE CLEARLY DEFINED TO AGREE ON A TOTAL CEASE-FIRE BEFORE 31 JANUARY, TO END THE REPRESSION, TO CONDUCT A PURGE IN THE ARMY, AND TO REORGANIZE THE JUDICIAL AND ELECTORAL SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH DETAILS WERE NOT GIVEN ON HOW THE ISSUES WILL BE HANDLED, THE FACT REMAINS THAT DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES WILL BEGIN IN ONLY A MONTH. IT MEANS THAT THE VEILED GOVERNMENT INTENTION TO DELAY THE TALKS AND CONTINUE THE WAR, WHICH IT CANNOT WIN IN ANY EVENT, HAS FAILED. WE MIGHT EVEN ADD THAT THE ARENA GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ON THE DEFENSIVE FROM THE BEGINNING, ESPECIALLY FOLLOWING THE TELA SUMMIT WHICH APPEALED TO THE SALVADORAN AUTHORITIES TO HOLD DIALOGUE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WITH THE REBELS. PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S ATTEMPT TO SECURE THE FORCEFUL DEMOBILIZATION OF THE GUERRILLAS AND HIS ATTEMPT TO COMPARE THESE FORCES WITH THE NICARAGUAN COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES ALSO FAILED. THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT'S POSITION AND ITS WILLINGNESS TO SECURE A DEFINITIVE PEACE AGREEMENT WILL BE IN EVIDENCE AT THE NEXT MEETINGS. MEANWHILE, THE PROSPECTS FOR ACHIEVING PEACE IN THE COUNTRY APPEAR TO BE FAVORABLE.
DEV-MUC3-0498	MOSCOW , 20 SEP 89 -- THE CENTRAL AMERICAN MASS MEDIA HAS REGARDED THE INTENTION OF SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI TO CONTINUE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE EXISTING CONSTITUTION AS A DEVIATION FROM RECENT AGREEMENTS WITH THE REBELS. THE INTENTION IS OUTLINED IN A STATEMENT MADE BY THE PRESIDENT IN REPSONSE TO THE REBEL PROPOSAL TO GIVE UP THE ARMED STRUGGLE AND JOIN THE POLITICAL LIFE IF THE ARMY CLEANS UP ITS RANKS, IF REPRESSIONS ARE STOPPED, ELECTIONS TO MUNICIPAL AND LEGISLATIVE BODIES ARE HELD EARLIER THAN 1991 AND IF THE ELECTION SYSTEM IS REFORMED. ACCORDING TO THE SALVADORAN MASS MEDIA, THIS PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS WILL BE DOMINATE THE FMLN TALKS WITH THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IN COSTA RICA IN OCTOBER. AT THE SAME TIME, THE SALVADORAN POLICE HAVE STAGED ANOTHER ACT OF VIOLENCE IN SAN SALVADOR. SPECIAL POLICE UNITS DISPERSED A DEMONSTRATION ORGANISED BY THE FEDERATION OF SALVADORAN TRADE UNIONS IN PROTEST AGAINST THE ARREST OF 12 ACTIVISTS OF WORKERS' AND PEASANT ORGANISATIONS. ABOUT 100 DEMONSTRATORS SHELTERED IN A CATHEDRAL. BUT, THE POLICE SMASHED THE CATHEDRAL'S WINDOWS AND SHOT TEAR GAS INTO THE BUILDING. POLICEMEN ALSO OPENED FIRE AND ARMY HELICOPTERS CIRCLED OVER THE CATHEDRAL. DESPITE THE FACT THAT MANY PEOPLE INSIDE WERE WOUNDED, THE POLICE DID NOT ALLOW RED CROSS REPRESENTATIVES TO APPROACH THE CATHEDRAL, AS DEMONSTRATORS DEMANDED. ABOUT 60 DEMONSTRATORS WERE FIRST BRUTALLY BEATEN AND THEN ARRESTED, THE SAN SALVADORAN MASS MEDIA SAID.
DEV-MUC3-0499	MOSCOW , 10 SEP 89 -- A U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE SPOKESMAN HAS INDICATED THAT WASHINGTON PROPOSES TO CONTINUE HELPING THE SALVADORAN REGIME UNTIL THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT COMBATANTS SURRENDER THEIR ARMS. THE TIMING OF THIS STATEMENT IS REMARKABLE. LET US RECALL THAT LESS THAN 1 WEEK AGO REPRESENTATIVES OF THE REBEL FORCES AND THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT MET IN MEXICO, THUS LAUNCHING A DIALOGUE AIMED AT A NATIONAL RECONCILIATION. THE PARTIES AGREED TO CONTINUE THESE TALKS IN COSTA RICA ON 16 AND 17 OCTOBER, HOWEVER, EVEN THE FIRST ROUND OF TALKS IN MEXICO SHOWED THAT CONTINUING THE WAR WAS POINTLESS BECAUSE NEITHER OF THE PARTIES IS CAPABLE OF MILITARY DEFEATING THE OTHER. THUS, THE ONLY POSSIBLE VICTORY FOR ALL IS THE VICTORY OF COMMON SENSE. THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED ONLY THROUGH NATIONAL DIALOGUE. THE REBELS HAVE CORRECTLY MADE IT CLEAR THAT NO PRECONDITIONS CAN BE SET FOR CONTINUING DIALOGUE, AND LESS STILL CAN IT BE DEMANDED THAT THE FMLN COMBATANTS SHOULD UNILATERALLY SURRENDER THEIR ARMS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THIS DEMAND IS BEING MADE WHILE THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS GETTING CONSIDERABLE MILITARY AID FROM THE UNITED STATES AND, ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE SPOKESMAN, IT HAS NO PLANS TO DISCONTINUE THIS AID. THE SALVADORAN MILITARY IS USING U.S.-MADE WEAPONS ONLY AGAINST THE REBELS AND NOT AGAINST ANY FOREIGN ENEMY. IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THROUGHOUT THE 10 YEARS OF CIVIL WAR IN EL SALVADOR, THE UNITED STATES HAS SUPPLIED ALMOST $4 BILLION WORTH OF MILITARY AND NONMILITARY AID TO THAT COUNTRY. THANKS TO THIS ASSISTANCE, 70,000 SALVADORANS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND OVER 1 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY TO SAVE THEIR LIVES. WE CAN SEE THAT ADDITIONAL U.S. MILITARY AID WILL INFLICT FURTHER UNTOLD SUFFERING AND MISFORTUNES ON THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. PUTTING AN END TO THIS ASSISTANCE AND TO ANY FURTHER INTERFERENCE IN SALVADORAN DOMESTIC AFFAIRS WOULD HELP DISPEL MUTUAL DISTRUST AND WOULD CREATE IN THE COUNTRY AN ATMOSPHERE FAVORABLE TO NATIONAL DIALOGUE. WASHINGTON'S DEMANDS THAT THE REBELS SHOULD SURRENDER THEIR ARMS AS A PRECONDITION FOR WASHINGTON TO RECONSIDER THE ISSUE OF MILITARY AID TO THE SALVADORAN REGIME REPRESENTS, AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED, UNACCEPTABLE INTERFERENCE IN EL SALVADOR'S DOMESTIC AFFAIRS. UNDOUBTEDLY, THE PROCESS OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATION MUST TAKE PLACE FREE OF ANY FOREIGN INTERFERENCE WHATSOEVER. I WOULD LIKE TO QUOTE JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, A REBEL LEADER, WHO TOLD THE NEW YORK TIMES THAT THE END OF U.S. MILITARY AID TO THE SALVADORAN REGIME WOULD LEAD TO AN IMMEDIATE END TO THE WAR.
DEV-MUC3-0500	SAN SALVADOR, 20 SEP 89 -- A HELICOPTER WAS DAMAGED, A REBEL WAS KILLED, AND TWO OTHERS WERE WOUNDED IN HEAVY CLASHES IN THE NORTHERN SECTOR OF THE COUNTRY, THE SALVADORAN ARMY REPORTED TODAY. THE OFFICIAL BULLETIN REPORTS THAT A FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT REBEL WAS KILLED AND TWO OTHERS WERE WOUNDED TODAY IN CLASHES IN DULCE NOMBRE DE MARIA, AND NUEVA CONCEPCION, IN THE NORTHERN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT. THE PRESS COMMITTEE OF THE ARMED FORCES REPORTED THAT THE GUERRILLA'S ANTIAIRCRAFT FIRE ON 19 SEPTEMBER DAMAGED A U.S.- MADE UH-1H AIR FORCE HELICOPTER AS IT WAS EVACUATING A WOUNDED SOLDIER NEAR SAN JOSE GUAYABAL, 30 KM NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR. THE ARMED CLASHES TOOK PLACE AMID THE FMLN 10-DAY UNILATERAL TRUCE DECREED BY THE FMLN ON 13 SEPTEMBER, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE DIALOGUE HELD LAST WEEK IN MEXICO CITY BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE INSURGENTS. MEANWHILE, AT LEAST THREE VILLAGES IN THE GUAZAPA HILL AREA, 25 KM NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR, TODAY REMAINED WITHOUT ELECTRICITY DUE TO THE INTENSE CLASHES WHICH LASTED UNTIL DAYBREAK. THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ONLY ADMITTED THAT A SOLDIER HAS BEEN KILLED IN THESE CLASHES AND THAT A HELICOPTER HAS BEEN DAMAGED. THE ARMY CLAIMS IT HAS INFLICTED SEVERAL CASUALTIES ON THE REBELS, BUT THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES IS STILL UNKNOWN. ACCORDING TO CIVILIAN SOURCES IN THE ZONE, SEVERAL HELICOPTERS AND AN AIRPLANE ON 19 SEPTEMBER AND TODAY AT DAYBREAK BOMBED ALLEGED REBEL POSITIONS IN THE FOOTHILLS OF GUAZAPA HILL.
DEV-MUC3-0501	BOGOTA, 21 SEP 89 -- AN ESCALATION IN TERRORIST ACTS AFFECTED THE CAPITAL AND RESULTED IN ONE PERSON WOUNDED AND UNDETERMINED LARGE PROPERTY LOSSES. NINE POWERFUL BOMBS EXPLODED ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY AT 0315 THIS MORNING AT EIGHT POLITICAL PARTIES' OFFICES AND A BRANCH OF THE SOCIAL SAVINGS ASSOCIATION. ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES, THE BOMBS WENT OFF AT THE POLITICAL OFFICE OF SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE COUNCILMAN DIEGO PARDO COPEL AT NO. 1810 ON 34TH STREET, THE POLITICAL OFFICES OF BOGOTA DISTRICT COUNCILMAN RICAURTE LOZANA VALDERRAMA AT NO. 2228 ON 37TH STREET AND NO. 2163 ON 34TH AVENUE, THE POLITICAL OFFICE OF SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE COUNCILMAN FRANCISCO FANADOR CABRERA LOCATED AT NO. 1824 ON 32D AVENUE, A LIBERAL PARTY OFFICE LOCATED AT NO. 1866 ON 36TH STREET, A LIBERAL PARTY REGISTRATION OFFICE LOCATED AT NO. 1976 28TH AVENUE, AN INDEPENDENT CONSERVATIVE PARTY OFFICE AT NO. 2326 37TH STREET, THE POLITICAL OFFICE OF MIGUEL SANTAMARIA DAVILA AT NO. 4136 28TH AVENUE, AND AT A BRANCH OF THE SOCIAL SAVINGS ASSOCIATION AT NO. 5119 ON 86TH STREET. THE DETONATIONS SHOOK TEUSAQUILLO NEIGHBORHOOD, AND ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL REPORTS, THE AUTHORITIES FELT COMPELLED TO INCREASE SECURITY MEASURES. THE WOUNDED PERSON WAS IDENTIFIED AS IRMA DE PUENTES, WHO WAS QUICKLY TREATED AT A CLINIC AND RELEASED BECAUSE SHE HAD ONLY A MINOR WOUND IN THE LEG.
DEV-MUC3-0502	MEXICO CITY , 22 SEP 89 -- ACCORDING TO WESTERN DIPLOMATS, COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE MOVED TO GUATEMALA IN SEARCH OF NEW SUPPLY ROUTES, BRINGING INSTABILITY TO A COUNTRY THAT IS EXPERIENCING A WAVE OF VIOLENCE FROM VARIOUS SECTORS. THE DIPLOMATS BELIEVE THAT UP TO 200 COLOMBIANS LINKED TO THE MEDELLIN AND CALI CARTELS ARE NOW OPERATING IN GUATEMALA AND THAT ABOUT 500 KG OF COCAINE PASS EVERY WEEK THROUGH THE COUNTRY, ESSENTIALLY ENROUTE TO THE U.S. MARKET. THE INCREASING DRUG TRAFFICKING ACTIVITY COINCIDES WITH A NEW WAVE OF KIDNAPPINGS, BOMBINGS, AND MURDERS IN GUATEMALA, AWAKENING FEARS THAT THE COUNTRY WILL RETURN TO THE VIOLENCE PREVALENT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DECADE, WHEN THOUSANDS WERE KILLED BY DEATH SQUADS DURING MILITARY REGIMES. SINCE AUGUST, A PROMINENT POLITICIAN, A WELL-KNOWN BANKER, AND AT LEAST FIVE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS HAVE BEEN MURDERED. SEVERAL BOMBS HAVE EXPLODED IN THE CAPITAL IN RECENT MONTHS AND STUDENTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS ARE MISSING. "ALL OF THIS VIOLENCE CANNOT BE BLAMED ON A , BUT THE INCREASE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING IS CLEARLY AN ADDITIONAL CONCERN." IN ADDITION TO THE COCAINE, WHICH THE DIPLOMATS SAY IS TAKEN TO THE UNITED STATES ABOARD LIGHT PLANES OR IN AUTOMOBILES THROUGH MEXICO AND TEXAS, U.S. OFFICIALS HAVE REPORTED AN INCREASE IN OPIUM PRODUCTION IN GUATEMALA. ACCORDING TO ESTIMATES, THE NUMBER OF HECTARES PLANTED WENT FROM 225 IN 1985 TO 1,500 THIS YEAR. THERE ARE INSISTENT RUMORS THAT BANKER RAMIRO CASTILLO LOVE WAS MURDERED OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE ON 25 AUGUST BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO LAUNDER DRUG MONEY. THERE IS OPEN TALK IN THE CAPITAL ABOUT IMPORTANT POLITICIANS BEING LINKED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING. NEVERTHELESS, THE DIPLOMATS SAY THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO BACK SUCH SPECULATION AND THEY ADD THAT IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT SEVERAL INTERESTS ARE WORKING TO DESTABILIZE THE COUNTRY'S FRAGILE DEMOCRACY. "IT SEEMS AS IF SEVERAL STRINGS ARE BEING PULLED AT THE SAME TIME," A DIPLOMAT SAID. WHILE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO HAS GIVEN GUATEMALA A RESPITE, AFTER DECADES OF MILITARY REGIMES DURING WHICH IT IS BELIEVED THAT MORE THAN 100,000 PEOPLE WERE KILLED AS A RESULT OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 1,200 LEFTIST GUERRILLAS ARE STILL FIGHTING IN THE MOUNTAINS. FURTHERMORE, THE COUNTRY HAS FACED TWO COUP ATTEMPTS SINCE DEMOCRACY WAS RESTORED IN 1986. THE ULTRA-RIGHT-WING, WITH ITS TIES TO THE LAND-OWNING OLIGARCHY, CONTINUES TO BE A POWERFUL FORCE IN THE COUNTRY. IT HAS BLOCKED A MAJORITY OF REFORMS THAT CEREZO HAS TRIED TO INTRODUCE AND, ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL CONSENSUS, IT HAS PROMOTED DISCONTENT AMONG THE ARMED FORCES' MID-LEVEL OFFICERS. "THE ULTRA-RIGHT-WING IS UNDOUBTEDLY BEHIND PART OF THE VIOLENCE," SAID A DIPLOMAT. "IT COULD BE TRYING TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO OVERREACT OR CAUSE THE ARMY TO GET INVOLVED." AS IF TO CONFIRM THIS, A POLICE ARREST WARRANT HAS BEEN ISSUED AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LIONEL SISNIEGA, A NOTED POLITICIAN WHO LEANS TO THE RIGHT AND HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN COUP ATTEMPTS SINCE 1954, ON CHARGES OF HEADING A GROUP RESPONSIBLE FOR MUCH OF THE VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY. DIPLOMATS HAVE ALSO POINTED TO THE RESURGENCE OF ACTIVITIES BY LEFT-WING GUERRILLAS WHO HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO TOPPLE SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS OVER THE PAST 2 DECADES. "NOWADAYS THEY ARE USING MUCH MORE OBVIOUS TACTICS, ERECTING BARRICADES ON HIGHWAYS AND OCCUPYING SMALL TOWNS NEAR THE CAPITAL," ONE DIPLOMAT SAID. FEAR THAT THE VIOLENCE OF THE SEVENTIES WILL RETURN MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD A RESURGENCE IN THE NUMBER OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS THAT CROSS OVER TO MEXICO. MEXICAN AUTHORITIES SAY THAT THE NUMBER OF UNDOCUMENTED CENTRAL AMERICANS DEPORTED TO GUATEMALA HAS DOUBLED OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS. THE DIPLOMATS FEEL THAT CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT WILL WEATHER THE VIOLENCE AND PASS IT ONTO HIS SUCCESSOR AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR NOVEMBER 1990. "PERHAPS THE SITUATION IS THE RESULT OF THE PREPARATION FOR ELECTIONS IN GUATEMALA," A DIPLOMAT SAID. "THINGS WILL PROBABLY WORSEN NEXT YEAR."
DEV-MUC3-0503	BOGOTA, 22 SEP 89 -- THE 13TH INFANTRY BRIGADE HAS REPORTED THAT FOLLOWING A SERIES OF ACTIONS BY SPECIAL URBAN TROOPS, FOUR PERSONS WHO ARE APPARENTLY INVOLVED IN THE MURDER OF DR LUIS CARLOS GALAN SARMIENTO HAVE BEEN ARRESTED. THEY ARE ALSO CONNECTED TO THE CAR BOMB ATTACK ON THE NEWSPAPER EL ESPECTADOR, TO A SERIES OF BOGOTA DYNAMITE ATTACKS, TO THE FREEING OF A GROUP OF PAID ASSASSINS, AND TO THE MURDER OF DR TEOFILO FORERO CASTRO, HIS WIFE, AND TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE ACCOMPANYING THEM. GENERAL RAMON EDUARDO NIEBLES UZCATEGUI, COMMANDER OF THE 13TH INFANTRY BRIGADE HAS SAID THAT AT LEAST TWO OF THOSE ARRESTED HAVE FULLY CONFESSED TO HAVING TAKEN PART IN THE MURDER OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN SARMIENTO IN SOACHA, CUNDINAMARCA.
DEV-MUC3-0504	BOGOTA, 22 SEP 89 -- IN BOGOTA, ORDERS HAVE BEEN ISSUED TO PLACE BANKS UNDER PERMAMENT MILITARY PROTECTION. LAST NIGHT TWO BOMBS EXPLODED AT BRANCHES OF THE POPULAR AND OCCIDENTE BANKS IN DOWNTOWN BOGOTA. A MINOR WAS WOUNDED. TO STOP THE WAVE OF ATTACKS ON BANKS AND FINANCIAL COMPANIES, THE DEFENSE MINISTRY THIS MORNING PLACED ALL BANKING AREAS IN THE CITY UNDER MILITARY CONTROL. THE SOLDIERS WILL REMAIN IN CHARGE OF THESE INSTALLATIONS AROUND THE CLOCK.
DEV-MUC3-0505	SAN SALVADOR, 22 SEP 89 -- A FEW MINUTES AGO, DEFENSE AND PUBLIC SECURITY MINISTER GENERAL RAFAEL HUMBERTO LARIOS ANNOUNCED THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE WILLING TO STUDY THE POSSIBILITY OF A TROOP REDUCTION IF AN AGREEMENT IS REACHED WITH THE LEFTIST REBELS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT. GENERAL LARIOS MADE THESE STATEMENTS TO FOUR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MEDIA REPORTERS. HERE ARE EXCERPTS OF GENERAL LARIOS' STATEMENTS WHEN HE ANNOUNCED THAT THE ARMED FORCES WOULD CONSIDER A REDUCTION IN TROOPS. ... WHEN IT INVOLVES DAMAGING THE INSTITUTION -- IN THIS CASE THE ARMED FORCES -- WE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT WE WERE NOT BORN ON A WHIM, OR BY HAPPENSTANCE OR ACCIDENT. WE ARE A CONSTITUTIONAL INSTITUTION AND THE CONSTITUTION HAS ESTABLISHED CLEAR TASKS FOR US. THUS, OUR INSTITUTION IS AUTHENTIC AND LEGAL. BECAUSE OF THIS, THE CONCEPT OR CRITERIA OF A REDUCTION IN ARMED FORCES PERSONNEL CAN BE MANAGED IF IT IS BASED ON VERY PARTICULAR AND SPECIFIC TERMS. IF, FOR EXAMPLE, WE REACH A POLITICAL AGREEMENT WITH THE TERRORIST FORCES FOR THEIR PEACEFUL RETURN TO THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC LIFE, THEN THIS WOULD MEAN THE END OF THE ARMED CONFLICT. IT WOULD ALSO MEAN THAT WE, AS THE COUNTRY'S ARMED FORCES, WOULD HAVE TO STUDY AND RECONSIDER THE NEED FOR THE NUMBER OF TROOPS THAT WE PRESENTLY HAVE AVAILABLE TO CONFRONT AN IMPOSED SITUATION, AN AGGRESSION OF A MARXIST-LENINIST NATURE. IF AN AGREEMENT IN THIS SENSE IS REACHED, WE WOULD BE WILLING TO ANALYZE THE INSTITUTION'S INTERNAL SITUATION TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF HUMAN RESOURCES NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY. THOSE WERE STATEMENTS BY THE DEFENSE MINISTER AT NOON. HE ANNOUNCED THAT THE ARMED FORCES WOULD BE WILLING TO STUDY A REDUCTION IN FORCES IF AN AGREEMENT IS REACHED BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND REBEL COMMISSIONS AT THE MEETING TO BE HELD IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, ON 16 AND 17 OCTOBER. GENERAL LARIOS SAID THAT PEACE WILL BE ATTAINED BEFORE THE ESTABLISHED DATE IF THE REBELS SHOW THEIR GOOD WILL TO END THE ARMED CONFLICT IN OUR COUNTRY. THIS WAS LAST MINUTE NEWS. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME A DEFENSE MINISTER HAS MADE SUCH AN ANNOUNCEMENT IN THE PAST 9 YEARS.
DEV-MUC3-0506	GUATEMALA CITY, 22 SEP 89 -- THE MAIN CHIEFS OF THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS DIRECTORATE OF THE GUATEMALAN POLICE WERE SUDDENLY DISMISSED FROM THEIR POSTS, DIC DIRECTOR COLONEL GEOVANNI CARDENAS REPORTED TODAY. "WE HAVE MADE THIS DECISION IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF THE POLICE FORCE," CARDENA SAID REFERRING TO THE DISMISSAL OF THE DIC CHIEF AND DEPUTY CHIEF, JORGE MENDEZ AND NOE PINEDA, WHO WILL BE REPLACED BY REMBERT LARIOS AND MANUEL PINTO. THE SUDDEN DISMISSAL OF THE MAIN CHIEFS OF THE DIC TOOK PLACE 3 DAYS AFTER PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO ADMITTED THAT THE SECURITY FORCES ARE INVOLVED IN A WAVE OF KIDNAPPING AND MURDER OF STUDENTS, WHICH HAS SHAKEN THE COUNTRY. MEANWHILE, PETER H. KOOIJMANS, UN SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON TORTURE CASES, TODAY CONTINUED HIS MEETINGS WITH VARIOUS GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY TO FAMILIARIZE HIMSELF WITH THE SITUATION PREVAILING IN GUATEMALA. THE OFFICIAL, WHO WILL CONCLUDE HIS OFFICIAL VISIT ON FRIDAY, HAS MET WITH PRESIDENT CEREZO AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE'S AND HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS.
DEV-MUC3-0507	GUATEMALA CITY, 18 SEP 89 -- ARMY SPOKESMAN COLONEL LUIS ARTURO ISAACS HAS SAID THAT POSSESSION OF WAR MATERIEL DESIGNATED FOR THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF THE MILITARY MAKES LIONEL SISNIEGA OTERO A TERRORIST. HOWEVER, COL ISAAC DID NOT CONFIRM WHETHER SISNIEGA WAS INVOLVED IN THE TERRORIST ATTACK THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS. INVESTIGATIONS HAVE CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS LIONEL SISNIEGA OTERO WH SUPPLIED THE GRENADES TO THOSE WHO ARE NOW UNDER ARREST. ONCE ARRESTED, SISNIEGA WILL HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO THE COURT WHY HE HAD THE WEAPONS, COL ISAACS ADDED. COL ISAACS CONFIRMED THAT MILITARY INTELLIGENCE IS INVESTIGATING HOW AND FROM WHERE SISNIEGA OTERO OBTAINED THE WAR MATERIEL. THE MILITARY SPOKESMAN SAID THE POSSESSION OF WAR MATERIEL BY CIVILIANS IS PROHIBITED AND PUNISHABLE BY LAW. IN THIS RESPECT, CIVILIAN PROTECTION SYSTEM AUTHORITIES SHOULD DEEPEN THEIR INVESTIGATIONS AND THE COURTS SHOULD BE STRICTER. ASKED ABOUT THE SURPRISING AND SUDDEN MANNER IN WHICH CAPTAIN LIONEL SISNIEGA CORDERO, SON OF SISNIEGA OTERO, WAS SENT OUT OF THE COUNTRY, COL ISAACS SAID THAT IT HAD BEEN DONE FOR HIS PERSONAL SAFETY, SINCE ANY EXTREMIST FACTION COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION TO TRY TO HARM HIM. ISAACS CONFIRMED THAT CAPT SISNIEGA OTERO WAS APPOINTED MILITARY ATTACHE AT THE GUATEMALAN EMBASSY IN VENEZUELA AND THAT FILLING THIS POSITION IS PART OF THE SOLDIER'S DUTY. WHEN ASKED WHETHER CAPT SISNIEGA CORDERO COULD HAVE SUPPLIED THE WEAPONS TO HIS FATHER, COL ISAACS REJECTED THE POSSIBILITY, ADDING THAT EVERY OFFICER KNOWS PERFECTLY WELL THAT KEEPING WAR MATERIEL AT HOME IS FORBIDDEN AND IN VIOLATION OF ARMED FORCES DIRECTIVES. POSSESSION OF WEAPONS IS A MISDEMEANOR AND NOT A FELONY, COL ISAAC SAID. AS AN EXAMPLE, HE SAID HE HAS A "GALIL" WHICH HE KEEPS AT HIS OFFICE, ALTHOUGH HE CARRIES HIS HANDGUN WHEREVER HE GOES. HOWEVER, HE SAID THE POSSIBILITY IS BEING INVESTIGATED, ALTHOUGH H CONSIDERS IT FAR-FETCHED. AS A RULE THE ARMY PROTECTS ITS MEMBERS, AN THIS IS PRECISELY WHY CAPT SISNIEGA CORDERO WAS GIVEN DIPLOMATIC STATUS AND SENT TO VENEZUELA. ON ANOTHER SUBJECT, COL ISAACS SAID HE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF A GUERRILLA ATTACK ON THE ACATENENGO DETACHMENT, POINTING OUT THAT THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY MAKES FALSE CLAIMS THAT DO NOT CORRESPOND WITH REALITY. THERE HAVE BEEN PERSISTENT RUMORS OF A RECENT SUBVERSIVE GROUP ATTACK ON THE ACATENANGO DETACHMENT DURING WHICH MANY CASUALTIES WERE INFLICTED.
DEV-MUC3-0508	BOGOTA, 22 SEP 89 -- ANOTHER DYNAMITE ATTACK TONIGHT AGAINST A BRANCH OFFICE OF THE DAILY EL ESPECTADOR, WEST OF BOGOTA, HAS RESULTED IN INJURIES TO A POLICEMAN AND HEAVY PROPERTY DAMAGE, IT WAS OFFICIALLY REPORTED. ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, SEVERAL MEN RIDING IN AN AUTOMOBILE THREW A POWERFUL BOMB AT THE MORNING DAILY'S OFFICE, INJURING SIGIFREDO AREVALO WHO WAS GUARDING THE SITE. ON 2 SEPTEMBER THE MAIN OFFICES OF EL ESPECTADOR WERE PARTIALLY DESTROYED BY A POWERFUL BOMB. THAT ATTACK WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE DRUG MAFIAS AGAINST WHICH THE NEWSPAPER HAS COURAGEOUSLY SET ITSELF. SINCE THAT DATE, THE NARCO-TERRORISTS HAVE CARRIED OUT 30 DYNAMITE ATTACKS IN BOGOTA, THE NEW SITE OF THE "WAR" THAT BEGAN IN MEDELLIN. NINE POLITICAL PARTY HEADQUARTERS, STATE AND PRIVATE BANK OFFICES, BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENTS, AND PRIVATE HOMES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED BY BOMB EXPLOSIONS IN BOGOTA IN THE LAST 48 HOURS.
DEV-MUC3-0509	BOGOTA, 22 SEP 89 -- THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION IN SOUTHERN BOGOTA TONIGHT AT ONE OF THE BOGOTA TELEPHONE COMPANY INSTALLATIONS. ACCORDING TO REPORTS JUST RECEIVED FROM THE METROPOLITAN POLICE, THE BUILDING WAS PARTIALLY DESTROYED. A SECURITY GUARD, WHO WAS INSIDE THE BUILDING, WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED, THE OFFICIAL REPORT FROM THE BOGOTA POLICE SAID. THE BOMB EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE IN OLAYA NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE CORNER OF 14TH AVENUE AND SOUTH 22D STREET IN SOUTHERN BOGOTA.
DEV-MUC3-0510	BOGOTA, 22 SEP 89 -- A DISTRIBUTION AGENCY OF THE BOGOTA NEWSPAPER EL ESPECTADOR AND THE OFFICE OF THE MORNING NEWSPAPER EL SIGLO WERE THE TARGETS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS TONIGHT WHICH LEFT ONE POLICEMAN SLIGHTLY INJURED AND CAUSED CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE, THE AUTHORITIES HAVE REPORTED. IN THE FIRST ATTACK, A 5-KG DYNAMITE CHARGE EXPLODED IN A BRANCH OF EL ESPECTADOR IN THE SUBURB OF NORMANDIA IN THE WESTERN PART OF BOGOTA. A SECURITY GUARD WAS INJURED BY THE SHATTERED GLASS CAUSED BY THE IMPACT OF THE EXPLOSION. ALTHOUGH THE NEWSPAPER OFFICE WAS NOT SERIOUSLY DAMAGED, SOME 10 HOMES NEARBY WERE. THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF EL ESPECTADOR, A NEWSPAPER WHICH HAS MAINTAINED A HARDLINE POSITION ON DRUG TRAFFICKING AND WHOSE DIRECTOR WAS ASSASSINATED IN DECEMBER 1986, WAS THE TARGET OF A VIOLENT CAR BOMB ATTACK 20 DAYS AGO. IN ANOTHER TERRORIST ACTION, SEVERAL MEN IN A VEHICLE OPENED FIRE ON THE OFFICES OF THE NEWSPAPER EL SIGLO, BUT NOBODY WAS INJURED. THIS IS THE SECOND ATTACK OF THIS KIND AGAINST THE NEWSPAPER IN THE PAST FEW DAYS. THE DIRECTOR OF THE NEWSPAPER IS FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ALVARO GOMEZ. IN VIEW OF THE INCREASED DYNAMITE ATTACKS SINCE 21 SEPTEMBER, WHEN NINE POLITICAL OFFICES AND THREE BANK BRANCHES WERE ATTACKED, THE ARMY AND POLICE HAVE INCREASED VIGILANCE IN BOGOTA.
DEV-MUC3-0511	KINGSTON , 23 SEP 89 -- SECURITY AT THE COLOMBIAN EMBASSY IN KINGSTON HAS BEEN TIGHTENED FOLLOWING A BOMB THREAT ON MONDAY , THE GLEANER NEWSPAPER REPORTED. SINCE MONDAY, THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASED PRESENCE OF UNIFORMED POLICEMEN ON GUARD OUTSIDE AND INSIDE THE XEROX BUILDING WHERE THE COLOMBIAN EMBASSY HAS ITS OFFICES. REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COLOMBIAN EMBASSY WERE UNWILLING TO TALK TO CANA, BUT THE GLEANER REPORTED THAT MINISTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY K.D. KNIGHT HAD CONFIRMED THAT THREATS HAD BEEN MADE AGAINST THE EMBASSY AND THAT THE NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS HAD BEEN PUT IN PLACE. HE SAID THERE WAS NO NEED FOR ALARM. KNIGHT SAID THAT THE EMBASSY HAD RECEIVED A THREATENING NOTE AND THAT THE MINISTRY HAD ALSO RECEIVED ONE THROUGH A "CHANNEL", BUT GAVE NO DETAILS. SINCE TAKING OFFICE, THE MANLEY GOVERNMENT HAS EXPRESSED ITS FIRM COMMITMENT TO STAMP OUT DRUG ABUSE AND DRUG TRAFFICKING. JAMAICA IS SAID TO BE A TRANSSHIPMENT POINT FOR DRUGS SHIPPED FROM SOME LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES TO THE UNITED STATES. THE NATIONAL SECURITY MINISTER, HOWEVER, SAID THAT FROM ALL INDICATIONS THE ACTION WAS A "TOTALLY INTERNAL ONE" AND THERE WAS NO OBVIOUS CONNECTIONS WITH THE DRUG WAR BETWEEN THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE MEDELLIN DRUG CARTEL. "WE ARE LOOKING AT THE MATTER WITH ALL SERIOUSNESS, BUT PRESENT INDICATIONS SHOW THAT WE DO NOT NEED TO BE ALARMED AND ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES HAVE ALREADY BEEN PUT IN PLACE", HE SAID.
DEV-MUC3-0512	BOGOTA, 23 SEP 89 -- IN NORTHERN BOGOTA, MILITARY INTELLIGENCE MEMBERS TODAY ARRESTED TWO ISRAELIS WHO SAID THEY ARE COLONEL HEGEJAM SETER AND MAJOR ESKENASI NISIM. THE ISRAELIS SAID THEY HAD BEEN CONTRACTED BY THE COLOMBIAN ARMY, BUT THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES DENIED ANY CONNECTION WITH THE TWO MEN WHO HAD BOMBS, PRIMING TUBES, AND MAPS FOR CARRYING OUT ATTACKS. MILITARY INTELLIGENCE IS TRYING TO DETERMINE THE CONNECTIONS AND MOTIVES OF THESE ALLEGED ISRAELI MILITARY OFFICERS.
DEV-MUC3-0513	GUATEMALA CITY, 22 SEP 89 -- A HIGH-RANKING MILITARY SOURCE CLOSE TO VINICIO CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT SUGGESTED TODAY THAT "THE OFFICERS OF THE MOUNTAIN" , A SECRET MILITARY ORGANIZATION THAT CONDUCTED TWO FAILED COUPS IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF, MAY BE INVOLVED IN THE WAVE OF TERRORIST EXPLOSIONS, ABDUCTIONS, AND POLITICAL MURDERS THAT HAS BEEN SCOURGING GUATEMALA OVER THE LAST 2 MONTHS. THE MILITARY SOURCE, WHO MADE STATEMENTS TO AFP ON THE CONDITION THAT HIS IDENTITY WAS NOT REVEALED, SAID THAT "THOSE GENTLEMEN HAVE BECOME THE NUMBER ONE ENEMY" OF CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT. THE SOURCE ADDED THAT "THE COUNTRY IS AGAIN FACING CERTAIN THREATS, INCLUDING THAT OF THOSE GENTLEMEN." THUS FAR, NOBODY KNOWS FOR SURE WHO THE MEMBERS OF THE ORGANIZATION ARE, ALTHOUGH SOME MEDIA SOURECES CLAIM THEY ARE "VERY POWERFUL AND WELL ORGANIZED." AMID THE TERRORIST ACTIVITY THAT HAS BEEN SHAKING GUATEMALA OVER THE LAST 2 MONTHS, "ODEM" HAS BEEN MARKING ITS INCREASING PRESENCE THROUGH FREQUENT COMMUNIQUES RELEASED CLANDESTINELY IN GUATEMALA CITY. IN THE COMMUNIQUES, IT LAUNCHES HARSH ATTACKS ON THE CURRENT GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT. IN ONE OF THEIR MOST RECENT COMMUNIQUES, WHICH THEY CIRCULATED IN GUATEMALA CITY LAST WEEK, THE REBEL MILITARY MEN SAY: "WE WILL NOT STOP UNTIL WE CHANGE THIS SYSTEM OF ANARCHY, CORRUPTION, AND DRUG TRAFFICKING. ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL ARMY SPOKESMAN, THE SEDITIOUS MILITARYMEN "ARE OFFICERS WHO WERE REMOVED FROM POWER IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND LOST ALL THEIR LEADERSHIP IN THE BARRACKS. THEIR RESENTMENT IS BEING MANIPULATED BY POLITICAL, CONSERVATIVE FORCES. "THEY ARE MANIPULATED BY PEOPLE OF THE EXTREME RIGHT, IN OTHER WORDS, BY POLITICAL CRIMINALS WHO WANT TO RETURN TO POWER TO REGAIN THEIR PAST PRIVILEGES." THIS WAS STATED TODAY BY ONE OF THE MILITRAY OFFICERS WHO LINKED THE THE ODEM TO THE ESCALATION OF TERRORISM IN THE COUNTRY. THE SAME SOURCE ADMITTED THAT THE SUSPECTED MILITARY TERRORISTS COULD HAVE "SUPPORTERS" WITHIN THE ARMY, BUT ADDED THAT "THE UNITY" OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMED FORCES IS NOT THREATENED BY THEM. IN THEIR FREQUENT COMMUNIQUES, ODEM IDENTIFIES ITSELF AS "PATRIOTS WHO OPPOSE THE COMMUNIST AND CORRUPT SYSTEM THEY WANT TO IMPOSE ON US THROUGH THE CURRENT POLICY IMPLEMENTED BY THE DRUG TRAFFICKING CLIQUE IN POWER."
DEV-MUC3-0514	BOGOTA, 24 SEP 89 -- WHILE COLOMBIANS WATCHED A SOCCER GAME BETWEEN ECUADOR AND PARAGUAY THIS AFTERNOON, TERRORISTS AVAILED THEMSELVES OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLACE FOUR MORE BOMBS IN VARIOUS PLACES THROUGHOUT BOGOTA. THE CAPITAL HAS BEEN THE TARGET OF SIX TERRORIST ATTACKS DURING THE LAST 24 HOURS. THE FIRST BOMB EXPLODED AT A BUILDING LOCATED ON THE CORNER OF 7TH STREET AND 56TH AVENUE, THE AREA WHERE 50 KG OF DYNAMITE EXPLODED 3 MONTHS AGO IN AN ATTEMPT TO KILL GENERAL MIGUEL ALFREDO MAZA. REPAIRS TO THE BUILDING'S DAMAGED WINDOWS HAD NOT BEEN COMPLETED AND NOW THE FIRST FLOOR, WHERE THE AVIANCA AIRLINE'S OFFICES ARE LOCATED, HAS BEEN TOTALLY DESTROYED. A DYNAMITE EXPLOSION THAT OCCURRED 3 BLOCKS AWAY, ON 13TH STREET AND 56TH AVENUE, HAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED THE HEADQUARTERS OF LAS VILLAS CORPORATION. THE AUTHORITIES WERE ABLE TO DEFUSE ANOTHER BOMB A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY, ON 13TH STREET AND 57TH AVENUE, BUT TERRORISM ALSO REACHED 1 MAY AVENUE AND 65TH STREET, WHERE THE COLDESARROLLO OFFICES WERE DESTROYED BY A 2-KG PACKAGE OF DYNAMITE. THE PUBLIC HAS DENOUNCED TODAY'S ATTACKS, WHICH LEFT NO CASUALTIES.
DEV-MUC3-0515	QUITO, 14 SEP 89 -- THE ECUADORAN POLICE DEALT A HARSH BLOW TO DRUG TRAFFICKING WHEN IT CAPTURED JUAN HERNANDO GONZALEZ AND GERMAN BELANDRIA, TWO DRUG TRAFFICKERS WHO WORKED FOR THE COLOMBIAN CARTELS. ACTING GOVERNMENT MINISTER LUIS FELIX LOPEZ SAID THE TWO COLOMBIANS WERE ARRESTED IN TAISHA, IN THE CENTRAL EASTERN REGION, WHEN THEIR AIRPLANE VIOLATED ECUADOR'S AIR SPACE. THE AIRPLANE, A LUXURY CESSNA 210 TWIN-MOTOR AIRCRAFT WITH A COLOMBIAN REGISTRATION, WAS FORCED TO LAND BY THE ECUADORAN ARMED FORCES. ACCORDING TO ECUADOR RADIO, THE AIRCRAFT MADE AN EMERGENCY LANDING IN THE AREA OF BUFFO IN PASTAZA PROVINCE. THE RADIO ADDED THAT THE AIRPLANE, NAMED CENTURION, IS WHITE AND HAS THE REGISTRATION NUMBER H-K-27-29. ONCE THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE ARRESTED THEY WERE BROUGHT TO QUITO AND DEPORTED TO COLOMBIA, WHERE THEY WILL BE TRIED. ACTING MINISTER LOPEZ SAID THAT THE EVENT OCCURRED IN TAISHA AT 1000 ON 14 SEPTEMBER. THE AIRCRAFT, WHICH WAS FLYING OVER ECUADORAN TERRITORY TOWARD AN UNKNOWN DESTINATION, IS NOW IN CUSTODY OF THE ECUADORAN ARMED FORCES AT THE TAISHA AIRPORT. THE TWO TRAFFICKERS HAD $336,000 IN THEIR POSSESSION. LOPEZ SAID THAT THE ECUADORAN GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO STOP THE INFILTRATION OF FOREIGNERS, PARTICULARLY THOSE INVOLVED IN DRUG TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES. THE ARREST OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS WAS COORDINATED BY THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND THE POLICE. GONZALEZ AND BELANDRIA ARE PRESUMABLY LINKED WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES, GIVEN THE LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY CARRIED AND THE FACT THAT THEY WERE CLANDESTINELY FLYING OVER ECUADORAN TERRITORY. IT IS PRESUMED THAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS COVERING THE CALI-PUERTO ASIS-LETICIA ROUTE.
DEV-MUC3-0516	CLANDESTINE, 22 SEP 89 -- THE U.S. SENATORS HAVE MADE A MISTAKE. THEY HAD A GREAT DEBATE TO A SIGN SHOWING THEIR WILLINGNESS TO HELP SUPPORT THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER, THEY VOTED IN FAVOR OF CONTINUING WITH THE MILITARY AID . THEY APPROVED AID THAT WILL BE INVESTED IN WAR, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS NOT A SIGN OF PEACE. THERE WERE TWO POSITIONS AT THE SENATE: THOSE WHO ADVOCATED THAT THE AID BE DIVIDED IN THREE PACKAGES TO CONTINUE THE DELIVERY OF THE LAST PORTION OF THE AID TO THE GOVERNMENT AMID THE DIALOGUE PROCESS, AND THOSE WHO WANTED TO GIVE UNCONDITIONAL AID TO CRISTIANI, A POSITION BASICALLY DEFENDED BY CHRISTOPHER DODD. SENATOR DODD HIMSELF SAID THIS AID IS ALLEGEDLY TO ENCOURAGE CRISTIANI BECAUSE HE IS ACCOMPLISHING WHAT THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IN THE PAST 10 YEARS. HOWEVER, THE U.S. SENATORS MADE A MISTAKE. THEY VOTED FOR THE UNCONDITIONAL AID WHICH ACTUALLY ENCOURAGES THE MILITARY MEN AND THE HARDLINERS IN ARENA WHO ARE BLOCKING THE POLITICAL SOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT AND WHO UNREASONABLY PROMOTE THE CONTINUATION OF THE WAR. THIS IS NOT A SIGN FOR THE MODERATES. THE VOTING FOR UNCONDITIONAL AID IS INTERPRETED BY THE FASCISTS, THE WARMONGERING, THE ARENA AS A BLANK CHECK TO CONTINUE WITH THE ADVENTURE OF WAR. THIS WAS THE TIME FOR U.S. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO SUPPORT WITH THEIR VOTING THE REGIONAL EFFORT AND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S EFFORT TO ATTAIN PEACE IN EL SALVADOR. THE FMLN HAS TAKEN UNMISTAKABLE STEPS THAT EXPRESS ITS WILLINGNESS TO HELP ATTAIN PEACE. HOWEVER, IT SEEMS THE U.S. SENATORS ARE MISINFORMED ABOUT EVENTS IN EL SALVADOR: THE INCREASE IN HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, THE ARRESTS, THE BOMBINGS, THE WAR PARADES, AND THE HARASSMENT OF THE PRESS. IN SUM, THESE ARE WAR ACTIONS AMID A NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL DEMAND FOR NEGOTIATIONS TO ATTAIN PEACE. THE U.S. SENATORS MADE A MISTAKE. WAR ACTIONS IN EL SALVADOR ARE CONTRARY TO THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND CLEARLY COME FROM THE , THE ARENA HARDLINERS. THEY ALSO ALSO FROM THE U.S. SENATORS WHO VOTED IN FAVOR OF THE UNCONDITIONAL AID. THEREFORE, THE U.S. SENATORS GAVE A SIGN ARE ENCOURAGING THE WAR WITH THIS BLANK CHECK TO THE ARENA GOVERNMENT.
DEV-MUC3-0517	SAN SALVADOR, 23 SEP 89 -- SALVADORAN VICE PRESIDENT FRANCISCO MERINO STATED TODAY THAT THE MILITARY ASPECTS OF THE AGREEMENTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAY REDUCTIONS. ACCORDING TO THE VICE PRESIDENT, AN EFFECTIVE CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT WITH THE FMLN MUST ALSO INCLUDE THE CONTROL OF VIOLENT ACTIONS BY MASS ORGANIZATIONS IN EL SALVADOR. MERINO MADE REFERENCE TO THE DOUBTS THAT CERTAIN MILITARY COMMAND SECTORS HAVE ABOUT THE FMLN'S PROPOSAL. HE SAID THAT THESE DOUBTS ARE PRESENT, MAINLY BECAUSE THE REBELS HAVE NOT KEPT THEIR PUBLIC PROMISES CONCERNING MILITARY ACTIONS IN THE PAST. HOWEVER, THE OFFICIAL COMMENTED THAT, IN THE LONG RUN, A CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT WOULD LEAD TO NEGOTIATIONS ON IMPORTANT ISSUES, SUCH AS MILITARY TROOP REDUCTIONS, THAT MUST BE ACCEPTED BY THE ARMED FORCES. LET US HEAR VICE PRESIDENT MERINO: WE CANNOT IGNORE THAT THE FMLN AND EVEN THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT HAVE MADE PROMISES THAT THEY NEVER KEPT. THE ARMED FORCES ARE A PERMANENT INSTITUTION AND THEY HAVE PREVIOUSLY SUFFERED THE NONCOMPLIANCE OF AGREEMENTS THAT HAD BEEN MADE BY THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT WITH THE FMLN. NOW, THE LACK OF TRUST MUST BE OVERCOME WITH SPECIFIC ACTIONS IN THE FUTURE. HERE, WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT MUST BE CLEARLY APPRECIATED. THE GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DIALOGUE PROCESS. THE ARMED FORCES ARE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT; THEY ARE AN INSTITUTION. PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IS THE GENERAL COMMANDER OF THE ARMED FORCES. THUS, THE ARMED FORCES' POSITION IS ALSO INCLUDED IN PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S STATEMENTS. ACCORDING TO MERINO, COMMENTARIES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY SEVERAL MILITARY COMMANDERS ARE TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS COMMENTARIES OUTSIDE ANY AGREEMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAY REACH WITH THE REBELS. ON THE SAME SUBJECT, THE VICE PRESIDENT ALSO COMMENTED THAT IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE GUERRILLAS TO CHANGE THEIR MILITARY BEHAVIOR, AS THEY HAVE TO SHOW THAT THEY REALLY WANT TO START A PROGRESSIVE WAR DE-ESCALATION PROCESS. THE EFFECTIVENESS AND TOTALITY WITH WHICH THE FMLN STOPS HOSTILITIES; CEASES ITS ACTS OF SABOTAGE AGAINST ELECTRICITY, COMMUNICATIONS, AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES; AND STOPS THE USE OF MINES WILL DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY'S OFFENSIVE ACTIONS. THIS IS LOGICAL, AS WHEN THERE IS NO AGGRESSION, THERE CAN BE NO ACTION TO COUNTER IT. MERINO SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL INCLUDES AN AGREEMENT FOR THE FMLN TO DRASTICALLY DECREASE STREET VIOLENCE IN EL SALVADOR, SUCH AS THE VIOLENCE PROMOTED BY MASS ORGANIZATIONS RECENTLY. HOSTILITIES ARE NOT ONLY THOSE ACTIONS THAT INCLUDE THE USE OF MILTARY FORCE, SUCH AS MINES, BOMBS, AND SO ON. THEY ALSO INCLUDE FMLN MASS ORGANIZATION ACTIONS THAT ARE CARRIED OUT MAINLY IN SAN SALVADOR AND ARE CREATING A CERTAIN DEGREE OF DESTABILIZATION. IT IS A KIND OF URBAN TERRORISM, AS THESE GROUPS ARE DISTORTING THE RIGHT TO PROTEST OR THE RIGHT OF EXPRESSION. THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE NO LONGER ONLY CARRYING A MESSAGE, BUT HAVE STARTED TO DESTROY AND DAMAGE PRIVATE PROPERTY AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, AND THREATEN THE CITIZENS' INTEGRITY. THUS, YOU SEE HERE A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WHICH DEMANDS THAT THE FMLN MILITARY ACTIONS AND CEASEFIRE MUST INCLUDE URBAN ACTIONS, AS WELL. A CEASEFIRE MUST ALSO INCLUDE THAT THE FMLN WILL NOT CARRY OUT OFFENSIVE ACTIONS OR ACTIONS BY FACADE GROUPS IN THE CITIES THAT PROMOTE STREET DISORDER. DURING PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S 15-DAY-ABSENCE, MERINO REPORTED THAT HE WILL WORK ON THE PROPOSAL THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL PRESENT TO THE FMLN IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA ON 16 OCTOBER, WITH AN ADVISORY COMMISSION FORMED BY MILITARY OFFICERS, PRIVATE BUSINESSMEN, INTELLECTUALS, AND POLITICAL PARTY LEADERS.
DEV-MUC3-0518	GUATEMALA CITY, 24 SEP 89 -- GUATEMALAN FOREIGN MINISTER MARIO PALENCIA WAS ASKED TODAY ABOUT THE CASE OF THE GUATEMALANS WHO TRAVELLED TO SPAIN. I HAVE NO INFORMATION, THEY DID NOT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY. I HAVE RECEIVED NO OFFICIAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THOSE PEOPLE. DO YOU HAVE ANY OFFICIAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE THREE STUDENTS WHO LEFT FOR PANAMA? NO, I HAVE NOT BEEN INFORMED ABOUT THEM EITHER. DO YOU BELIEVE THEY LEFT THROUGH THE NORMAL CHANNELS? THE FOREIGN MINISTRY HAS NOT CARRIED OUT ANY SPECIAL PROCEDURE. THE DEPARTURE OF TWO STUDENT LEADERS WHO SAID THEY HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO PERSECUTION AND THREATS CAME LESS THAN 2 WEEKS AFTER THE DEATH OF FOUR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WHO HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED, AND COINCIDED WITH THE PRESENCE IN GUATEMALA OF UN OBSERVER PETER KOOIJMANS, A SPECIALIST IN TORTURE ANALYSIS, WHO MAY REMAIN IN THE COUNTRY FOR 6 DAYS. FOREIGN MINISTER MARIO PALENCIA ADMITTED THAT THE ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE IN GUATEMALA OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS, RELATED SITUATIONS SUCH AS THE FLIGHT OF GUATEMALANS TO OTHER COUNTRIES, AND THE REESTABLISHMENT OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TRAVEL ADVISORY, HAVE AFFECTED GUATEMALA'S INTERNATIONAL IMAGE. NEVERTHELESS, THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED TO THE ATMOSPHERE OF UNREST IN THE COUNTRY HAVE NORMALIZED SOMEWHAT.
DEV-MUC3-0519	CLANDESTINE, 26 SEP 89 -- JUST 10 DAYS AFTER A DIALOGUE WAS HELD IN MEXICO, THE SITUATION HAS BECOME MORE TENSE IN VIEW OF THE GOVERNMENTS AND ARMED FORCE'S ATTITUDE. THE GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FMLN HEREBY ANNOUNCES THE FOLLOWING: 1. THE FMLN HAS SHOWN ITS WILLINGNESS AND FLEXIBILITY BY CARRYING OUT UNILATERAL ACTIONS, AND PRESENTING A REALITISTIC PEACE PROPOSAL THAT COVERS THE ASPIRATIONS OF THE ENTIRE NATION IN ENDING THE CONFLICT IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. 2. ON THE CONTRARY, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE NOT MADE ANY EFFORTS, BUT RATHER THEY HAVE HARDENED THEIR STANDS AND CARRIED OUT REPRESSIVE ACTIONS. IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, WHILE WE OFFERED A UNILATERAL TRUCE, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE CONDUCTED PROVOKING WAR ACTIONS; LAUNCHED MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE AREAS UNDER GUERRILLA CONTROL; BOMBED CIVILIAN POPULATIONS IN MORAZAN, CHALATENANGO, AND GUAZAPA; MAINTAINED A MILITARY SEIGE ON THE UNIVERSITY AND TRADE UNION BUILDINGS; AND EVICTED PEASANTS AND TENANTS FROM THEIR LANDS. THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN UNLEASHING A MERCILESS REPRESSION AGAINST THE ORGANIZATION OF THE PEOPLE, TRADE UNIONS, PEASANTS, RELIGIOUS GROUPS, AND STUDENTS. THE NATION HAS BEEN SHOCKED TO HEAR THAT OVER 400 PEOPLE WERE CAPTURED IN THE LAST MONTH. DOZENS OF PEOPLE ARE MISSING OR DEAD. THE FASCIST BRUTAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT ASHAMED TO EXHIBIT UNDIGNIFIED PICTURES OF TRADE UNION LEADERS -- WHO SHOW SIGNS OF HAVING BEEN TORTURED -- TESTIFYING BEFORE JUDGES. THE GOVERNMENT PUBLICLY SHOWS THE HORROR OF WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN RAPED IN THE PRISONS OF THE NATIONAL POLICE, THE OUTRAGES COMMITTED AGAINST THE BAPTIST CHURCH, AND THE BEATINGS AND THREATS AGAINST NEWSMEN. THE GOVERNMENT EXHIBITS TERRIFYING PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE NEWSPAPERS OF WORKERS TIED BY THEIR THUMBS, AND BLINDFOLDED IN THE MOST REPULSIVE STYLES OF THE DEATH SQUADS. WE HAVE REACHED SUCH A STATE OF PROVOCATION THAT VICE PRESIDENT FRANCISCO MERINO IS TRYING TO HUMILIATE PUBLICLY THE PEOPLE'S SECTORS BY CALLING THEM TRASH. THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT EVEN TRIED TO SOLVE THE CASE OF THE WAR HANDICAPPED; THERE ARE 45 OF THEM OCCUPYING THE METROPOLITAN CATHEDRAL. THE ONLY ANSWER TO THEIR DEMANDS FOR MEDICAL ATTENTION ABROAD IS THE RIOT POLICEMEN THAT HAVE BEEN SENT TO THREATEN ATTACKING TO ACHIEVE THE FREEDOM OF 11 INNOCENT YOUTHS WHO WERE CAPTURED AT A LOCAL CLINIC. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, THE U.S. CONGRESS HAS APPROVED SENDING $90 MILLION TO THE FASCIST GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE FINANCING THE WAR AND REPRESSION. 3. THIS STATE OF REPRESSION AND THIS MOCKERY TO THE LEGITIMATE ASPIRATIONS OF THE PEOPLE FOR PEACE IS UNACCEPTABLE. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SAY: NO MORE CAPTURES, TORTURE, MURDERS, BOMBINGS, SIEGES, EVICTIONS, OR HUMILIATION! TO OUR FRIENDS AND ENEMIES, WE SAY THAT JUST LIKE WE REMAIN FLEXIBLE AND OPEN FOR NEGOTIATIONS, WE WILL LIKEWISE BE WILLING, ABLE, AND READY TO ACCOMPANY THE PEOPLE IN THEIR STRUGGLE AND STRONGLY CARRY THE FLAG OF DEMOCRACY AND PEACE TO ADVANCE UNTIL WE HAVE NAILED THAT FLAG INTO THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ONLY WANT WAR. THIS GENERAL COMMAND HEREBY ORDERS ALL OUR GROUPS, FIGHTERS, MILITIA MEMBERS, AND COLLABORATORS TO DEFEND WITH HONOR AND STRENGTH AND WITH THEIR WEAPONS THE FLAG OF DEMOCRACY AND PEACE THAT THE ENTIRE NATION DEMANDS. WE HEREBY NOTIFY THAT TODAY, 26 SEPTEMBER 1989, OUR FORCES HAVE BEGUN A NATIONAL MANEUVER THAT WE CALL "STOP THE REPRESSION, EVERYONE FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF DEMOCRACY AND PEACE." OUR MANEUVER CALLS FOR ATTACKING SEVERAL GARRISONS AND STRATEGIC POSITIONS OF THE ARMY IN THE FOUR REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY. WE WILL CONTINUE REPORTING ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ACTIONS IN THE FOUR WAR FRONTS IN A FORTHCOMING COMMUNIQUE. AGAINST REPRESSION, EVERYONE FOR ACHIEVING DEMOCRACY AND PEACE.
DEV-MUC3-0520	SAN SALVADOR, 26 SEP 89 -- THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF NOT WANTING TO NEGOTIATE THE END OF THE WAR AND INCREASING THE "REPRESSION" AGAINST WORKERS. IN A LETTER DISCLOSED ON MONDAY, 25 SEPTEMBER, AND SENT TO THE UNITED NATIONS, THE OAS, AND THE FOREIGN MINISTRIES OF EUROPE AND THE AMERICAS, THE REBELS SAY THAT SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES "ARE MAINTAINING THEIR INFLEXIBILITY, USING THE CONSTITUTION AS AN EXCUSE." THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT IS WARNING THAT THERE ARE TWO STANCES IN THE FACE OF THE DIALOGUE: ONE IS OF "FLEXIBILITY AND GOODWILL," AND THE OTHER, OF "INFLEXIBILITY AND PROVOCATION THAT USES THE DIALOGUE TO ESCALATE THE WAR AND REPRESSION." IN ITS LETTER, THE FMLN GAVE A RUNDOWN OF ITS BIDS TO "PROMOTE A DIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION" WITH THE GOVERNMENT, MENTIONING ITS UNILATERAL TRUCE AND DECISION TO STOP SABOTAGING THE ELECTRICITY AND TELEPHONE NETWORKS AND USING MINES. IN ADDITION, THE GROUP NOTED IT SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL "THAT IS VERY FLEXIBLE IN ACHIEVING PEACE," AND THAT CONSIDERS THE END OF HOSTILITIES AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE REBELS MAY BECOME A POLITICAL PARTY. HOWEVER, THE REBELS STATED THE GOVERNMENT HAS INCREASED HUMAN RIGHTS "VIOLATIONS," AND IS KEEPING A CIRCLE AROUND THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS AND TRADE UNIONS, YET IT WANTS DILATORY TALKS WITHOUT COMMITTMENTS. THE FMLN SAID THE APPROVAL BY THE U.S. SENATE OF MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR, UPPING IT FROM $85 TO $90 MILLION, "ENCOURAGES THE MOST HARD LINE SECTOR OF THE CURRENT SALVADORAN REGIME." ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLAS, THE MILITARY AID "CONSTITUTES A HARD BLOW AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF FINDING A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT," THAT IN 9 YEARS HAS CLAIMED OVER 70,000 LIVES. GOVERNMENT AND FMLN DELEGATIONS MET FROM 13 TO 15 SEPTEMBER IN MEXICO AND PLEDGED TO SEEK A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THAT COUNTRY'S STRIFE. THE TWO DELEGATIONS AGREED TO CONTINUE THE TALKS ON 16 AND 17 OCTOBER IN SAN JOSE TO ANALYZE THE POSSIBILITY OF A CEASE-FIRE AND ESTABLISH THE STEPS TO END THE WAR. DIVERSE LOCAL SECTORS, WHICH ARE DEMANDING A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE WAR, HAVE RECEIVED THE AGREEMENTS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF OPTIMISM. HOWEVER, SOME LEADERS OF RIGHTIST NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE AND SOME MILITARY CHIEFS HAVE QUESTIONED THE FMLN'S OFFERS.
DEV-MUC3-0521	BOGOTA, 26 SEP 89 -- THE M-19 GUERRILLA GROUP , WHICH IS ABOUT TO SIGN A PEACE AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT, TODAY PROPOSED OPENING A DIALOGUE WITH THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS. ACCORDING TO THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES, ONE OF THE DRUG LORDS IS SURROUNDED. MEANWHILE, A POWERFUL BOMB EXPLODED IN A HOTEL IN THE CARTAGENA DE INDIAS TOURIST CENTER, ON THE CARIBBEAN, KILLING TWO PERSONS. IT IS BELIEVED THE BOMB WAS PLACED BY GROUPS LINKED TO NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS. THE M-19 PROPOSED PARDONING THOSE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS WHO DISMANTLE THEIR BUSINESSES AND BECOME LAW-ABIDING. IN RADIO STATEMENTS MADE TODAY, M-19 COMMANDER CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ SAID THAT THE GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION HAS MADE CONTACT WITH THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS, WHO HAVE REPORTEDLY SAID THEY ARE WILLING TO JOIN A GENERAL PEACE PLAN. THE PROPOSAL WAS SIGNED BY THE HIERARCHY OF THE M-19 -- FOUNDED IN 1974 AND ONE OF THE MOST NOTORIOUS COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA GROUPS -- IN THEIR CAMP IN SANTO DOMINGO, SOME 400 KM SOUTHWEST OF BOGOTA. IN EXCHANGE FOR DISMANTLING THE LABORATORIES AND THE ARMED GROUPS, THE M-19 PROPOSED NOT EXTRADITING THE ALLEGED NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS TO THE UNITED STATES. THE M-19 PROPOSAL HAS TAKEN BY SURPRISE THE GOVERNMENT OF VIRGILIO BARCO, INASMUCH AS IT HAD VOICED ITS DETERMINATION NOT TO HOLD ANY DIALOGUE WITH THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS, A JUDICIAL SOURCE HAS TOLD REUTER. "THE ISSUE OF THE DIALOGUE IS BECOMING VERY SERIOUS AND I BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY A WAR ALWAYS CONCLUDES WITH A PEACE AGREEMENT," ONE OF THE ADVISERS OF FORMER JUSTICE MINISTER MONICA DE GREIFF SAID. THE M-19 PROPOSAL, WHICH INCLUDES A PLAN SO THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS THEMSELVES WILL FINANCE A CAMPAIGN AGAINST DRUG CONSUMPTION, HAS NOT BEEN ACCEPTED YET BY THE GOVERNMENT. IN AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE, IT WAS STRESSED THAT THE ISSUE OF THE DIALOGUE WITH THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS WILL NOT FORM PART OF THE PEACE AGREEMENT REACHED WITH THE M-19. RELATIONS BETWEEN THE COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA GROUPS AND THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS HAVE HAD THEIR UPS AND DOWNS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS. AT FIRST, SOME ARMED GROUPS GAVE PROTECTION TO THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS IN EXCHANGE FOR MONEY FOR PURCHASING WEAPONS. HOWEVER, LATER, WHEN THEY TRIED TO TAKE OVER PART OF THE BUSINESS, THEY WERE HARSHLY FOUGHT BY THE PARAMILITARY BANDS OF THE EXTREME RIGHT FINANCED WITH DRUG MONEY. PIZARRO SAID TODAY THAT THE TOPIC WILL NOT AFFECT THE SIGNING OF THE AGREEMENT, WHICH HAS BEEN POSTPONED SINCE 24 SEPTEMBER FOR "LAST-MINUTE MINOR DIFFICULTIES." HE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE WEAPONS OF THE ORGANIZATION, WHICH HAS OVER 600 MILITANTS, WILL NOT BE TURNED OVER TO THE ARMY, BUT TO AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION, PROBABLY THE RED CROSS. HOWEVER, WHILE THE M-19 -- WHICH ACCORDING TO THE PEACE PLAN SHOULD BE DEMOBILIZED AT THE END OF THE YEAR -- IS ASKING FOR A DIALOGUE WITH THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS, THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES ANNOUNCED THAT GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, ALSO KNOWN AS "EL MEXICANO," IS SURROUNDED AND WILL BE IMMINENTLY CAPTURED. A SPOKESMAN FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY HAS TOLD REUTER: "WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE CAPTURING IMPORTANT PEOPLE WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT KNOW IF RODRIGUEZ GACHA WILL ALSO BE CAPTURED." RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND PABLO ESCOBAR ARE CONSIDERED THE CAPOS OF THE FEARFUL MEDELLIN CARTEL, A NARCOTICS ORGANIZATION WHICH TOGETHER WITH ITS TWIN ORGANIZATION IN CALI IS CHARGED WITH EXPORTING 80 PERCENT OF THE COCAINE CONSUMED IN THE UNITED STATES. THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS OFFERED A 100-MILLION-PESOS REWARD TO ANY CITIZEN PROVIDING INFORMATION ON THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE TWO MOST-WANTED MEN IN COLOMBIA. ON 25 SEPTEMBER, A JUDGE ORDERED THE ARRESTED OF FREDDY RODRIGUEZ CELADES, SON OF "EL MEXICANO," FOR ILLEGAL PSSESSION OF FIREARMS. NATIONAL POLICE CHIEF GENERAL MIGUEL GOMEZ PADILLA RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THAT THE TWO NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS ARE IN COLOMBIAN TERRITORY, THUS DENYING RUMORS TO THE EFFECT THEY WERE SETTING UP BASES IN PANAMA OR BRAZIL.

CLASHES CONTINUED THIS MORNING BETWEEN TROOPS OF THE 3RD AND 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADES IN USULUTAN. PATROLS ARE CHASING THE REBELS. IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT IN CIUDAD BARRIOS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SAN MIGUEL THE REBELS PLACED SOME ROADBLOCKS AND DISTURBED MILITARY POSITIONS. NO CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN THESE INCIDENTS.

THE BULLETIN ALSO REPORTS THAT IMPORTANT MILITARY EQUIPMENT WAS SEIZED FROM THE FMLN GUERRILLAS.
DEV-MUC3-0523	NO CITY , 26 SEP 89 -- ACCORDING TO THE PACT SIGNED TODAY, A BILATERAL COMMISSION THAT WILL BE CREATED SOON WILL DISCUSS THE MANNER IN WHICH THE GUERRILLA GROUP WILL BE DEMOBILIZED. M-19 COMMANDER CARLOS PIZARRO SAID TODAY THAT THE ORGANIZATION, WHICH HAS A LITTLE MORE THAN 600 MEMBERS, WILL NOT TURN IN ITS WEAPONS TO THE ARMY, BUT TO AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION, POSSIBLY THE RED CROSS. HOWEVER, WHILE THE M-19 IS CALLING FOR A DIALOGUE WITH THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, INTELLIGENCE SERVICES HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, ALIAS "EL MEJICANO," HAS BEEN SURROUNDED AND WILL SOON BE CAPTURED. A SPOKESMAN FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE SECURITY DEPARTMENT, THE COLOMBIAN INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION, TOLD REUTER: "WE BELIEVE THAT IMPORTANT ARRESTS WILL BE MADE IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT KNOW IF WE WILL CATCH RODRIGUEZ GACHA." RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND PABLO ESCOBAR ARE CONSIDERED TO BE THE HEADS OF THE FEARSOME MEDELLIN CARTEL, AN ORGANIZATION OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS THAT, ALONG WITH ITS TWIN ORGANIZATION IN CALI, IS ACCUSED OF SUPPLYING 80 PERCENT OF THE COCAINE THAT IS CONSUMED IN THE UNITED STATES. THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS OFFERED A REWARD OF 100 MILLION PESOS TO ANY CITIZEN WHO PROVIDES INFORMATION ON THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE TWO MOST WANTED MEN IN COLOMBIA. YESTERDAY, A JUDGE ISSUED A WARRANT FOR THE ARREST OF FREDDY RODRIGUEZ CELADES, SON OF "EL MEJICANO," FOR THE ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF WEAPONS. IN RECENT STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS, GENERAL MIGUEL GOMEZ PADILLA, CHIEF OF THE NATIONAL POLICE, SAID THAT BOTH DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARE IN COLOMBIAN TERRITORY, THUS DENYING REPORTS THAT THEY HAD REPORTEDLY MOVED THEIR BASES OF OPERATION TO PANAMA OR BRAZIL. FINALLY, IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS, A TOURIST CENTER ON THE CARIBBEAN COAST, A POWERFUL BOMB EXPLODED IN A HOTEL, KILLING TWO PEOPLE. THE ATTACK WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF AN ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE IN WHICH OVER 70 BOMBS HAVE EXPLODED IN A LITTLE OVER 1 MONTH.
DEV-MUC3-0524	BOGOTA, 26 SEP 89 -- IN A NEW ACTION ATTRIBUTED TO THE DRUG TRAFFICKING RINGS OPERATING IN BOGOTA, A MEDIUM-SIZED BOMB PARTIALLY DESTROYED A SECONDARY SCHOOL LOCATED IN A POPULOUS SOUTHERN BOGOTA NEIGHBORHOOD TONIGHT. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE EXPLOSION SEVERELY DAMAGED THE SAN IGNACIO DE LOYOLA SCHOOL, LOCATED A SHORT DISTANCE FROM A POLICE STATION. AUTHORITIES SAID THE EXPLOSION CAUSED NO CASUALTIES, ALTHOUGH IT RESULTED IN LOSSES AMOUNTING TO MILLIONS. THE DYNAMITE ATTACK, THE 41ST IN BOGOTA DURING THIS MONTH, OCCURRED ONLY A FEW HOURS AFTER ANOTHER EXPLOSION DESTROYED ONE STORE OF A SUPERMARKET CHAIN. NUMEROUS THREATS SAYING THAT BOMBS HAD BEEN PLANTED IN SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN THE "WAR" THAT THE DRUG CARTELS HAVE DECLARED IN REPRISAL FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENSE OFFENSIVE AGAINST THEM.
DEV-MUC3-0525	NO CITY , 27 SEP 89 -- SOME OF THE ARRESTED PERSONS ARE EXTRADITABLE. THE PEOPLE HAVE RISEN UP AGAINST TERRORISM, AND THE TERRORISTS CANNOT HIDE FOREVER. THIRD, MUCH INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR COLOMBIA, ITS DEMOCRACY, ITS PEOPLE, AND ITS GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN MOBILIZED. COLOMBIA IS NO LONGER SEEN AS A COUNTRY OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS, SOMETHING IT HAS NEVER BEEN AND NEVER WILL BE. NOW EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT WE ARE A COUNTRY OF BRAVE PEOPLE WHERE THE MAJORITY ARE HONEST AND HARD-WORKING. THE WORLD HAS ACKNOWLEDGED AND PRAISED DEMOCRACY IN COLOMBIA, THE VICTIM OF A PROBLEM IT HAS NOT CREATED. FOURTH, INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE CRIMES COMMITTED BY NARCOTERRORISTS CONTINUE GIVING POSITIVE RESULTS. MORE THAN 25 BANDS OF ASSASSINS HAVE BEEN DISMANTLED, AND THEIR MEMBERS HAVE BEEN DISPERSED. TWO OF THE PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN HAVE CONFESSED TO THE CRIME. THE DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE SECURITY HAS IDENTIFIED 110 PERSONS WHO FORM PART OF A NARCOTERRORIST NETWORK. THE MOST IMPORTANT ASSASSINATIONS HAVE BEEN CLEARED UP. FIFTH, THE AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHECK THE TERRORISTS' COUNTEROFFENSIVE, ALTHOUGH IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT THE CRIMINALS ARE STILL CAPABLE OF CAUSING MUCH DAMAGE. THIS HAS BEEN MADE EVIDENT BY THE EXPLOSIVES THEY HAVE PLACED, THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED AND WHO HAVE BEEN INJURED, AND THE FIRES THEY HAVE PRODUCED. THE AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FRUSTRATE MANY ATTACKS. CRIMINALS WHO HAVE CARRIED OUT ATTACKS HAVE BEEN CAPTURED. FOR EXAMPLE, IN MEDELLIN, 35 CRIMINALS WHO WERE COORDINATING WITH THE TERRORIST NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY HAVE BEEN CAPTURED. SIXTH, DRUG TRAFFICKING CAPABILITIES HAVE DECREASED. NOW THERE IS MUCH LESS COCAINE IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN OTHER WORLD MARKETS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT IT IS UP TO THE UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO INCREASE THEIR ACTIVITIES TO DIMINISH AND CONTROL DRUG CONSUMPTION. IF THERE WERE NO ADDICTS IN THOSE COUNTRIES, THERE WOULD BE NO DRUG TRAFFICKING. THIS IS NOT THE ONLY RESPONSIBILITY OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES INVOLVED IN THE WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING. IF DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE UNABLE TO USE THEIR MONEY THROUGH INTERNATIONAL BANKS AND INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES THAT OTHER COUNTRIES OFFER, THE INCENTIVES FOR THE BUSINESS WOULD VANISH. IF THE CHEMICAL PRODUCTS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO PROCESS COCAINE DID NOT ARRIVE IN OUR COUNTRY FROM EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES, THE DRUG COULD NOT BE PRODUCED. IF THE INTERNATIONAL ARMS MARKET WERE UNDER CONTROL, THE TERRORISTS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THE ARMS THEY HAVE USED TO SPILL SO MUCH BLOOD IN COLOMBIA.
DEV-MUC3-0526	MANAGUA , 27 SEP 89 -- NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY PRESIDENT COMMANDER CARLOS NUNEZ HAS STATED THAT THE 39 FORMER GN MEMBERS NOW IN JAIL WILL NOT BE RELEASED UNTIL THE COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY FORCES IN HONDURAS ARE DEMOBILIZED. COMMANDER NUNEZ DEMANDED THAT THE CONTRAS RELEASE MORE THAN 1,000 NICARAGUANS THEY HAVE KIDNAPPED AND STOP MURDERING CIVILIANS. HE SAID THAT THE 39 FORMER GN MEMBERS WILL BE RELEASED WHEN THE COUNTERREVOLUTION IS DEMOBILIZED IN HONDURAS, AS WAS AGREED WITH THE 21 NICARAGUAN POLITICAL PARTIES. THE 39 FORMER SOMOZIST ARMY MEMBERS, WHO ARE SO STRONGLY DEFENDED BY MORE THAN ONE REPRESENTATIVE WHO ALLEGE QUOTE HUMANITARIAN UNQUOTE REASONS, ARE GOING TO STAY IN PRISON AND WILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE LIST . LIKEWISE, THE REST OF THE CONTRA PRISONERS, WHO ARE NOT ON THIS LIST, WILL ALSO REMAIN IN PRISON. THEY WILL REMAIN THERE UNTIL WE HAVE HAVE CLEAR, DEFINITE INDICATIONS FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE MERCENARIES THAT THEY ARE GOING TO COMPLY WITH AGREEMENTS. THEY WILL STAY IN PRISON UNTIL WE CAN CLEARLY SEE THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE CONTRAS AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL ACTIVITY. WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW THE WORD RECONCILIATION TO BE CHANGED INTO DEMAGOGUERY. THIS WORD HAS REAL MEANING. WE ARE WILLING TO COMPLY WITH AGREEMENTS AND HAVE EVIDENCED OUR WILLINGNESS WITH GESTURES OF GENEROSITY. WE ARE NOT ASKING THE CONTRAS TO BE GENEROUS. WE ARE ASKING THE CONTRAS TO COMPLY WITH THE TELA AGREEMENTS SIGNED IN HONDURAS. WE ARE ALSO ASKING FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED WITH THE POLITICAL PARTIES DURING THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE, THAT THE PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN KIDANAPPED BY THE CONTRAS BE RETURNED, AND THAT THEY STOP THEIR ATTACKS AND MURDERS THAT EVEN NOW -- ALTHOUGH SOME POLITICIANS ARE BLIND TO THIS -- CONTINUE.
DEV-MUC3-0527	BOGOTA, 26 SEP 89 -- IN A FIRST RULING, CRIMINAL JUDGE 62 OF RIONEGRO MUNICIPALITY, NORTHWESTERN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, HAS ACQUITTED DRUG TRAFFICKERS PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA AND GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA OF CHARGES OF MASTERMINDING THE MURDER OF ATTORNEY GENERAL CARLOS MAURO HOYOS AND THE KIDNAPPING OF BOGOTA CITY MAYOR ANDRES PASTRANA. THE RULING WAS ISSUED ON THE NIGHT OF 25 SEPTEMBER AND REVEALED ON 26 SEPTEMBER. HOYOS WAS KIDNAPPED ON 25 JANUARY 1988 AND WAS FOUND DEAD 8 HOURS LATER NEAR THE MEDELLIN AIRPORT. PASTRANA WAS KIDNAPPED ON 22 JANUARY 1988 BUT WAS RESCUED BY THE ARMY 3 DAYS LATER. THE "EXTRADITABLES" CLAIMED CREDIT AT THE TIME FOR THESE TWO ACTIONS. IN HIS FIRST RULING, JUDGE FRANCISCO CARDENAS SAID "THERE IS NOT SUFFICIENT GROUNDS OR EVIDENCE" FOR LINKING ESCOBAR GAVIRIA AND RODRIGUEZ GACHA, THE MAIN CHIEFTAINS OF THE MEDELLIN DRUG CARTEL, TO THE CRIMES. THE EXTRADITION OF THE DRUGPINS HAS BEEN REQUESTED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THE PROSECUTOR IN THE CASE HAS APPEALED JUDGE CARDENAS' RULING BEFORE THE SUPERIOR TRIBUNAL OF MEDELLIN, WHICH WILL SOON ISSUE A PRONOUNCEMENT ON THE VALIDITY OF THE COURT RULING.
DEV-MUC3-0528	GUATEMALA CITY, 27 SEP 89 -- IT WAS REPORTED IN THIS CAPITAL TODAY THAT HEAVILY ARMED MEN KIDNAPPED THREE EUROPEANS IN TECUN UMAN LAST NIGHT. THOSE WHO WERE KIDNAPPED ARE JOSE MARIA MARTINEZ, 55, FROM SPAIN; ROBERTO LIZARDI, 52, FROM FRANCE; AND LUIS ROSSI, 35, FROM ITALY. THE REPORT ON THE KIDNAPPINGS WAS MADE BY EDGAR AND LESBIA LEAL, OWNERS OF THE DON JOSE HOTEL LOCATED ON THE BORDER WITH MEXICO. ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS, THE HEAVILY ARMED AND UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS BROKE INTO THE HOTEL LOBBY WHERE THE THREE EUROPEANS WERE AND TOOK THEM AWAY TO AN UNKNOWN DESTINATION. THE HOTEL OWNERS SAID THEY KNOW NOTHING OF THE REASON FOR THE TRIPLE KIDNAPPING OR THE IDENTITIES OF THE PERPETRATORS.
DEV-MUC3-0529	BOGOTA, 27 SEP 89 -- DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS COLOMBIAN SECRET POLICE HAVE ARRESTED 30 CRIMINALS WHO BELONG TO A BAND OF HIRED ASSASSINS OPERATING IN THE CONFLICTIVE MIDDLE MAGDALENA AREA OF THE COUNTRY'S CENTRAL REGION. AN OFFICIAL REPORT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE SECURITY -- THE SECRET INTELLIGENCE AGENCY THAT ADVISES COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO -- SAYS THAT 15 OF THOSE ARRESTED ARE IMPLICATED IN MURDERS. IN ADDITION, THE DAS MANAGED TO DISMANTLE FOUR GROUPS OF HIRED ASSASSINS KNOWN AS "THE COCKROACHES, "THE PLATEAUS," "THE SMUDGED ONES," AND "DEATH TO KIDNAPPERS" . MEANWHILE, THE ARMY HAS REPORTED THAT NINE PRIVATELY-OWNED, LIGHT AIRCRAFT USED IN DRUG TRAFFICKING WERE CONFISCATED DURING VARIOUS OPERATIONS CONDUCTED THIS WEEK. THE AIRCRAFT HAVE BEEN DELIVERED TO THE NATIONAL DRUG COUNCIL AND THEIR OWNERS ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION. THE TWO OPERATIONS ARE PART OF THE OFFICIAL OFFENSIVE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING MAINTAINED BY BARCO'S GOVERNMENT SINCE 18 AUGUST.
DEV-MUC3-0530	LA PAZ, 28 SEP 89 -- BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA HAS STATED THAT BOLIVIA NEEDS ADEQUATE ASSISTANCE TO SOLVE ITS PROBLEMS. HE ADDED THAT BOLIVIA NEEDS A LEADER LIKE NORIEGA TO ATTRACT INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION. IN A NEWS CONFERENCE WITH U.S. REPORTERS, PRESIDENT PAZ YESTERDAY ANSWERED SEVERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING AND THE ERADICATION OF COCA CROPS. THE BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT STRESSED THE EFFORTS MADE BY THE BOLIVIAN PEOPLE TO OVERCOME HYPERINFLATION OF MORE THAN 27,000 PERCENT. HE SAID THAT INFLATION IS PREDICTED TO REACH 12 PERCENT DURING HIS ADMINISTRATION. PAZ ZAMORA STATED THAT THE HIGHLY INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES MUST PAY ATTENTION TO NATIONS SUCH AS BOLIVIA THAT FACE DIFFICULT ECONOMIC SITUATIONS AND AT THE SAME TIME STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING. HE CRITICIZED THE BEHAVIOR OF WORLD POWERS, AND HE SAID THAT SUCH BEHAVIOR MUST BE CHANGED. WE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF THE WAY INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES AND THEIR PEOPLE ARE BEHAVING, MAINTAINING CERTAIN SADOMASOCHISTIC RELATIONS WITH THE UNDERDEVELOPED NATIONS. THE BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT TRIED TO MAKE THE U.S. PRESS UNDERSTAND THE INDIFFERENCE THAT CERTAIN COUNTRIES, NAMELY THE ECONOMIC POWERS, SHOW TOWARD BOLIVIA. TO EXPLAIN HIS REMARKS, HE SAID THAT PERHAPS A GENERAL SHOULD ASSUME POWER, AND MILITARY FORCES SHOULD BESIEGE THE U.S. EMBASSY, AND A FEW HUNDRED PEOPLE SHOULD BE MURDERED TO GET THE ATTENTION OF THE WORLD. PAZ ZAMORA DEMANDED GREATER UNDERSTANDING FROM THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT IMPOSE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT CONDITIONS FOR ACHIEVING ECONOMIC STABILITY. DOES A WAR KILL MORE PEOPLE THAN AN ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM, THE BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT ASKED. HE INVITED THE U.S. REPORTERS TO REVIEW THE STATISTICS ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE KILLED IN THE SALVADORAN WAR AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO DIED IN BOLIVIA BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC-FINANCIAL ADJUSTMENTS. PRESIDENT PAZ HAS STATED THAT THE FACT THAT BOLIVIA IS A COCA- PRODUCING COUNTRY IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE U.S. TREATMENT OF THE MATTER. HE SAID THAT THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING DEMANDS ACTION TO CONTROL CONSUMPTION. HE ADDED THAT BOLIVIA IS NOT RECEIVING THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH THE SOCIAL PROBLEMS RESULTING FROM THE REDUCTION OF COCA PRODUCTION. AN ANTINARCOTICS PROGRAM FOR BOLIVIA SIMILAR TO THAT IMPLEMENTED IN COLOMBIA WOULD BE A GREAT MISTAKE . HE DEMANDED REAL ALTERNATIVES FOR WORK AND PRODUCTION FOR BOLIVIAN PEASANTS. HE SAID THAT UNTIL THIS IS ACHIEVED, THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST WILL BE REPEATED.
DEV-MUC3-0531	CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- WE ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE EFFORT TO STOP FASCISM AND BRING ABOUT A GENUINE DEMOCRACY. THE BASIS FOR A NEGOTIATION IN EL SALVADOR SHOULD BE THAT DEMOCRACY PRECEDES PEACE. OUR COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT WE ARE SEARCHING FOR DEMOCRACY AND PEACE. WE MENTION THEM IN THAT ORDER BECAUSE IF WE WERE TO SEEK PEACE FIRST, AS THE GOVERNMENT WANTS, WE WOULD HAVE THE PEACE OF DEATH. YOU REFERRED TO COMBATANTS AND THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT. HOWEVER, IN THE PAST FEW DAYS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE FASCIST REGIME; THAT IS, THE FMLN MAIMED. WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ABOUT THEIR PLIGHT AND ATTITUDE? THE STRUGGLE OF THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT INVOLVING INDIVIDUALS WHO WAGE IMPORTANT BATTLES WITHOUT WEAPONS IS QUITE ADMIRABLE. I BELIEVE THAT THE STRUGGLE OF THE WAR MAIMED IS TWICE AS ADMIRABLE. THEY ARE NOT ONLY WAGING A BATTLE WITHOUT WEAPONS, BUT WITH THEIR MUTILATED BODIES. THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT IS EXPERIENCING VERY TRYING MOMENTS. IT IS FACING REPRESSION. THIS SHOWS THE REGIME AS IT REALLY IS. THE MAIMED HAVE ALSO DEALT A VERY IMPORTANT BLOW: THEY HAVE EXPOSED THE BRUTALITY AND STUPIDITY OF ARMY LEADERS WHO SET UP ANTIRIOT CORDONS, SURROUNDED THE CATHEDRAL, AND THREATENED PEOPLE WHO ARE UNABLE TO WALK OR ARE MISSING A LIMB . IT IS REALLY A HEROIC STRUGGLE MUCH LIKE THE ONES THAT MANY MAIMED COMRADES HAVE WAGED FROM THEIR JAILS. THEY HAVE OPENED THE WAY FOR OTHER COMRADES TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY. I THINK THIS IS TO BE ADDED TO THE FACT THAT ALL OF THE PEOPLE'S FORCES WHO HAVE TAKEN UP THE BANNER OF PEACE AND DEMOCRACY, EVEN THE WAR-DISABLED, HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO OUR EFFORT WITH THEIR SACRIFICE.
DEV-MUC3-0532	BOGOTA, 29 SEP 89 -- IT WAS REPORTED TODAY IN BOGOTA THAT THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS REJECTED AN APPEAL PRESENTED BY BEATRIZ RODRIGUEZ ZUNIGA'S LAWYER, WHO WANTED HER ARREST FOR EXTRADITION PURPOSES CANCELLED. RODRIGUEZ ZUNIGA IS SAID TO BE AN IMPORTANT MEDELLIN CARTEL CONNECTION. RODRIGUEZ ZUNIGA WAS ARRESTED SEVERAL WEEKS AGO IN CARTAGENA AND, WITH THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH'S CONSENT, COULD BE THE SECOND PERSON EXTRADITED TO THE UNITED STATES, PART OF THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE DRUG MAFIAS THAT STARTED A MONTH AND A HALF AGO. ON 6 SEPTEMBER THE ALLEGED "FINANCIAL HEAD" OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, EDUARDO MARTINEZ ROMERO, WAS SENT TO THE UNITED STATES AFTER WASHINGTON PRESENTED DOCUMENTATION TO HAVE HIM TRIED IN AN ATLANTA COURT. DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTARTION INVESTIGATIONS REPORT THAT MARTINEZ ROMERO WAS A KEY PERSON IN THE "WASHING" OF APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION THE MAFIA OBTAINED FROM THE COCAINE BUSINESS. THE DRUG "BARONS" HAVE PUBLICLY THREATENED TO MURDER 10 JUDGES FOR EACH COLOMBIAN EXRADITED TO ANOTHER COUNTRY. SINCE MARTINEZ ROMERO WAS SENT TO ATLANTA THERE HAVE BEEN HUNDREDS OF DYNAMITE ATTACKS IN DIFFERENT COLOMBIAN CITIES. THESE ATTACKS ARE THE COCAINE CARTELS' DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFENSIVE AGAINST THEM.
DEV-MUC3-0533	BOGOTA, 24 SEP 89 -- WHAT IS THE TRUTH OVER THE SIGNING OF THE DECREES? WERE THEY SIGNED ONLY AFTER THE ATTACK ON LUIS CARLOS GALAN? THE DECREES WERE BEING STUDIED SINCE NOON ON THE DAY OF HIS DEATH. IT HAD BEEN A VERY TOUGH WEEK. THE MAGISTRATE AND THE COLONEL HAD BEEN MURDERED; GALAN WAS MURDERED THAT EVENING. THERE WAS MUCH DISCUSSION OVER THE DRAFTS, BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE ATTACK ON GALAN HURRIED THINGS UP. IN THE CASE OF THE EXTRADITION DECREE, WE WERE ALL AWARE THAT IT WAS NOT A POPULAR MEASURE. PHILOSOPHICALLY, MOST MINISTERS DID NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF COLOMBIANS BEING TRIED ABROAD. THERE WAS MUCH LEGAL DISCUSSION, NOT ONLY TO DO WITH THIS CASE, BUT ALSO OVER THE NEW MEASURES CONCERNING RAIDS, SEIZURES, AND ARRESTS. HOWEVER, FINALLY THERE WAS A GREAT DETERMINATION TO GIVE THE COUNTRY ANSWERS. THE COUNTRY'S CURRENT PROBLEMS HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH THE EXTRADITION DECREE. WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT THESE MEASURES ARE NOT AGAINST A GROUP OF PEOPLE, BUT AGAINST VIOLENCE. EXTRADITION HAS BEEN A VERY TOUGH MEASURE FOR EVERYONE. THE INCONVENIENCES AND THE LEGALITY OF THIS DECREE, AS WELL AS THE POSSIBLE REACTIONS AGAINST IT, WERE DISCUSSED A GREAT DEAL. IT CAN BE THAT PART OF THE VIOLENCE GENERATED HAS BEEN DUE TO THE EXTRADITION DECREE. IS IT POSSIBLE TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE WITH THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS AS A WAY OF ENDING THE COUNTRY'S VIOLENCE? THE GOVERNMENT SAID NO TO THE DIALOGUE, BUT WE MUST WAIT AND SEE HOW EVENTS DEVELOP. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A GOVERNMENT'S DECISION CAN BE STRICT, BECAUSE SITUATIONS DO CHANGE. THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID THAT DIALOGUE IS IMPOSSIBLE. YOU NEVER KNOW, THINGS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. ANYWAY, IN COLOMBIA PRACTICALLY NO WARS HAVE ENDED, BECAUSE IN NEARLY ALL WARS AN AGREEMENT WAS REACHED. BUT IF COLOMBIA HOLDS A DIALOGUE, THE WORLD'S DOORS WILL PROBABLY CLOSE ON COLOMBIA. LOOK, IN THE UNITED STATES I WAS ASKED ABOUT THE EXTRADITION AND I SAID IT WAS NOT POPULAR, THAT IT WAS NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM. IT IS NOT THE GOVERNMENT'S STANCE, BUT IF IT IS DECIDED TO HOLD A DIALOGUE, THEN THIS WOULD BE A SOVEREIGN COLOMBIAN DECISION. OBVIOUSLY, IF THE POSITION CHANGES A BAD IMPRESSION WILL BE GIVEN. THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT IT HAS NOT LOST ITS SOVEREIGNTY. THE INTERNATINAL PRESS FEELS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED WITH YOUR RESIGNATION. ONE MUST NOT FORGET THAT YOU BECAME A SYMBOL FOR THE FOREIGN JOURNALISTS WHEN YOU TRAVELED TO WASHINGTON. I HELD A NEWS CONFERENCE ON 22 SEPTEMBER AND I TOLD THEM THAT MY RESIGNATION WAS NOT MONICA DE GREIFF'S POSITION, BUT THE GOVERNMENT'S. I TOLD THEM I WAS STAYING IN THE COUNTRY, AND I EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT THE MINISTERS HERE REMAIN AT THEIR POSTS UNTIL THE PRESIDENT DECIDES OTHERWISE. HOWEVER, THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY. WHAT WILL MONICA DE GREIFF DO? I AM GOING TO REST FOR A FEW DAYS AND THEN RETURN. I AM GOING TO HELP ERNESTO SAMPER'S CAMPAIGN. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WORKING FOR PRIVATE ENTERPRISE WILL BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY. WHAT POST HAS GIVEN YOU THE GREATEST SATISFACTION? WHEN I WAS AT THE MINISTRY OF MINES AND ENERGY. IT WAS FASCINATING. I HAD TWO VERY GOOD BOSSES: GUILLERMO PERRY AND OSCAR MEJIA. I WORKED IN DELIGHTFUL HARMONY WITH A GROUP OF GOOD PEOPLE. I BELIEVE THAT MINING AND HYDROCARBONS IS THE SECTOR THAT HAS ENJOYED THE GREATEST PROGRESS UNDER THIS GOVERNMENT. WHAT IS YOUR FINAL FEELING UPON LEAVING THE MINISTRY? EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING. I HAVE BEEN SPARED FROM MANY BORING THINGS. I HAVE NOT HAD TO SIGN EXTRADITION ORDERS OR THINGS LIKE THAT. WITHOUT REALIZING IT, I HAVE BEEN SPARED OF TIRING THINGS.
DEV-MUC3-0534	SAN SALVADOR, 29 SEP 89 -- THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WILL OFFER A "TOTAL AMNESTY" TO THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT . IN EXCHANGE, IT WILL ASK THE INSURGENTS TO LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND JOIN CIVILIAN LIFE, JUSTICE MINISTER OSCAR SANTAMARIA ANNOUNCED TODAY. IN STATEMENTS TO A LOCAL TELEVISION STATION, SANTAMARIA SAID THE PROPOSAL WILL BE OFFICIALLY PRESENTED TO THE REBEL LEADERS DURING THE SECOND ROUND OF THE DIALOGUE, WHICH WILL BE HELD 16 - 17 OCTOBER IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA. SANTAMARIA, WHO IS THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT DIALOGUE COMMISSION SPOKESMAN, MET FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH THE FMLN LEADERS ON 13, 14, AND 15 SEPTEMBER IN MEXICO CITY. ON 21 SEPTEMBER, DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL HUMBERTO LARIOS, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE 9 YEARS OF WAR, SAID THAT REDUCING THE NUMBER OF ARMY TROOPS, AS DEMANDED BY THE REBELS, IS FEASIBLE. HE SAID THE GOVERNMENT IS DRAFTING A DOCUMENT ON THE CEASE-FIRE THAT IT WILL PRESENT AT THE COSTA RICA MEETING. DURING THE MEXICO MEETING THE PARTIES IN CONFLICT AGREED TO HOLD MEETINGS TO TRY TO REACH AN AGREEMENT ON THE WAR, WHICH HAS RESULTED IN 70,000 DEATHS OVER A 9-YEAR PERIOD. DESPITE THE DIALOGUE, THE GUERRILLAS THIS WEEK LAUNCHED ONE OF THE MOST VIOLENT MILITARY CAMPAIGNS YET, WHICH EVEN AFFECTED SAN SALVADOR. THIS GUERRILLA CAMPAIGN IS IN RESPONSE TO "INCREASING REPRESSION AND ASSASSINATIONS" OF LABOR LEADERS. THE ONLY ISSUE TO BE DISCUSSED AT THE COSTA RICA MEETING WILL BE THE CEASE-FIRE. THE TWO PARTIES HAVE EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THAT AN AGREEMENT WILL BE REACHED BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR. IN ADDITION TO THE REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF ARMY TROOPS, THE REBELS PROPOSED IN MEXICO THAT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH BE REORGANIZED AND THAT A PROSECUTOR BE APPOINTED AS A RESULT OF A CONSENSUS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE POLITICAL PARTIES. IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION ABOUT THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE ARMED STRUGGLE BY THE REBELS, SANTAMARIA SAID: "WE ARE AT A STAGE WHERE THE TENSION LEVEL IS DECLINING. WE HAVE FOUND POINTS OF AGREEMENT, AND WE AND WILL HONOR THEM."
DEV-MUC3-0535	SAN SALVADOR, 29 SEP 89 -- WE REPORT TO YOU THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO THE PRESENT SITUATION IN THE SEARCH FOR A JUST AND LASTING PEACE IN EL SALVADOR. 1. WE NOTE WITH DEEP CONCERN THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN ALARMING INCREASE IN HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMANITARIAN WAR NORMS VIOLATIONS BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES. THESE VIOLATIONS CAN BE OBSERVED IN THE REPRESSION OF DEMONSTRATIONS, TORTURES, MURDERS, ARRESTS -- MORE THAN 400 IN THE PAST MONTH -- DISAPEARANCES, AND IN THE GOVERNMENT'S REFUSAL TO ALLOW MAIMED FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT MEMBERS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY TO GET MEDICAL ATTENTION. THIS NORM IS STIPULATED IN THE GENEVA CONVENTION, AND THIS IS AN AGREEMENT THAT HAS BEEN SIGNED BY THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT. THIS SITUATION HAS BEEN CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED BY THE RESOLUTION ISSUED BY THE SUBCOMMISSION PERIOD IN AUGUST 1989. MR CRISTIANI SAID THIS RESOLUTION WAS NOT TRUTHFUL. 2. GOVERNMENT SPOKESMEN AND MR CRISTIANI HIMSELF HAVE REPEATEDLY STATED THAT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PEACE DEPENDS ON THE FMLN'S HALTING HOSTILITIES. THIS PRESENTS A UNILATERAL PLAN THAT HAS NOT BEEN AGREED UPON POLITICALLY, MILITARILY, OR OPERATIONALLY. IN CONTRAST TO THESE STATEMENTS, WHEN THE FMLN UNILATERALLY DECLARED A TRUCE RECENTLY, MR CRISTIANI, OFFICIALS IN HIS ADMINISTRATION, AND MILITARY COMMANDERS STATED THAT THESE FMLN MEASURES WERE PROPAGANDISTIC AND THAT THE TRUCE WAS NOT RESPECTED. THEIR ARGUMENTS WERE ATTEMPTS TO JUSTIFY THE GOVERNMENT'S BREAKING OF THE TRUCE. THESE EVENTS GIVE US ADDITIONAL GROUNDS FOR STATING THAT A DEFINITE AND UNCONDITIONAL HALT TO HOSTILITIES IS UNREALISTIC AND UNFEASIBLE.
DEV-MUC3-0536	BOGOTA, NO DATE -- RECENT EXPRESSIONS OF SOLIDARITY AND SUPPORT FOR COLOMBIA HAVE GREATLY ENCOURAGED US IN THESE TRYING TIMES. WE ARE NOW LIVING IN DIFFERENT TIMES, BUT THE SITUATION IS NO LESS CRITICAL THAN THE ONE THAT LED TO THE EMERGENCE OF THE UNITED NATIONS. A NEW WORLD WAR HAS BEEN DECLARED BY AN AGGRESSOR THAT DOES NOT RESPECT THE TRADITIONAL RULES OF WAR OR NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY. THE AGGRESSOR IS A PERNICIOUS INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION THAT HAS GREAT POWER AND RESOURCES AND THAT IS NOURISHED BY ILLEGAL REVENUES GENERATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKING. AS THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL RECENTLY SAID, AND I QUOTE: THE ILLEGAL USE OF AND TRAFFICKING IN DRUGS TODAY IS SEEN AS A SOCIAL PLAGUE THAT AFFECTS BOTH INDUSTRIALIZED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. ALTHOUGH EFFORTS TO FIGHT THIS SCOURGE HAVE INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS, STATISTICS SHOW THAT THE MONETARY VALUE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING IS GREATER THAN THAT OF THE INTERNATIONAL OIL TRADE AND IS ONLY SURPASSED BY ARMS TRAFFICKING. IT IS CERTAINLY WORRISOME TO SEE THAT MANKIND IS SO DEEPLY INVOLVED IN TRAFFICKING DEGRADATION AND DEATH. END OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL'S STATEMENT. THE MEMBERS OF THESE CRIMINAL CARTELS WERE BORN IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES, AND MANY OF THEIR LEADERS ARE BELIEVED TO BE COLOMBIANS. ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT SOME OF THEM MAY HAVE BEEN BORN IN MY COUNTRY, I MUST CLARIFY THAT THEY ARE COLOMBIANS IN NAME ONLY. THEY ARE REALLY JUST INTERNATIONAL FUGITIVES WHO HAVE NO HOME. COLOMBIA IS NOT THEIR HOMELAND! I AM ALSO HERE AT THE UNITED NATIONS TO PRESENT TO YOU THE CRUDE REALITY OF THIS WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING. COLOMBIA IS ON THE FRONTLINE OF THIS BATTLE. FOR US IT IS NOT A WAR OF WORDS. MANY COLOMBIANS HAVE DIED BECAUSE OF THEIR FIRM COMMITMENT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING. APPROXIMATELY 1 MONTH AGO, LUIS CARLOS GALAN, ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS POLITICAL LEADERS IN MY COUNTRY, WAS ASSASSINATED. HIS DEATH HAS CONSOLIDATED EVEN MORE THE NATION'S WILL AND HAS DRAWN THE WORLD'S ATTENTION TO THE PROBLEM. HOWEVER, MANY COLOMBIANS HAVE DIED OVER THE YEARS -- AS HE DID -- AS VICTIM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING. THAT LONG LIST INCLUDES 12 MAGISTRATES OF THE SUPREME COURT, AN ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND A JUSTICE MINISTER. PROMINENT CONGRESSMEN, JUDGES, MAYORS, JOURNALISTS, THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS, POLICEMEN, AND COLOMBIAN CITIZENS HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES FOR DEMOCRACY. LAST MONTH, AFTER ANNOUNCING EXCEPTIONAL MEASURES AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, WHICH WERE DECREED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STATE OF SIEGE, DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE CONTINUED AND INTENSIFIED THEIR TERRORIST ACTIONS.
DEV-MUC3-0537	GUATEMALA CITY, 29 SEP 89 -- POLICE SOURCES REPORTED TODAY THAT A SPANIARD, A FRENCHMAN, AND AN ITALIAN, KIDNAPPED IN TECUN UMAN ON 27 SEPTEMBER, HAVE BEEN RELEASED WITHIN THE PAST FEW HOURS. SPANIARD JOSE MARIA MARTINEZ, FRENCHMAN ROBERTO LISANDY, AND ITALIAN DINO ROSSY, WHO WERE STAYING AT A TECUN UMAN HOTEL, WERE KIDNAPPED BY ARMED MEN WHO TOOK THEM TO AN UNKNOWN PLACE. AFTER THEY WERE RELEASED, THE THREE EUROPEANS WENT TO THE REGIONAL POLICE STATION AND GAVE A FULL ACCOUNT OF THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH THE KIDNAPPERS. MARTINEZ TOLD THE POLICE THAT THE KIDNAPPERS HELD THEM IN A DARK ROOM AND QUESTIONED THEM. THE THREE MEN WERE TAKEN TO A MEDICAL CENTER AFTER THEIR RELEASE AND, ACCORDING TO THE MEDICAL REPORT, SUFFERED NO WOUNDS. OFFICIALS REPORTED THAT MARTINEZ AND LISANDY DO BUSINESS IN TECUN UMAN AND HAVE BEEN LIVING THERE FOR THE PAST 9 MONTHS. ROSSY WAS ENJOYING HIS VACATION HERE, WHEN HE WAS KIDNAPPED. ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, THE PERSONS WHO KIDNAPPED THE THREE MEN GOT THEM DRUNK BEFORE RELEASING THEM SO THAT THEY WOULD LOSE TRACK OF TIME AND BE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY WHERE THEY HAD BEEN HELD CAPTIVE.
DEV-MUC3-0538	BOGOTA, 25 SEP 89 -- THE SELF-DETERMINATION OF PEOPLES MEANS NATIONS HAVE THE ABILITY TO SETTLE THEIR DOMESTIC PROBLEMS BY THEMSELVES. BASED ON THIS VIEW, SEVERAL OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST OUSTANDING DEMOCRATS AND DUPES DENOUNCED FOREIGN MILITARY AID TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING, A SCOURGE THAT BECAME AN INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM A LONG TIME AGO AND IS WEAKENING COLOMBIAN SOVEREIGNTY. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THOSE WHO ARE NOW MOST OPPOSED TO THE PRESENCE OF U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS AND EXPERTS ARE THOSE WHO REGARD THIS PRESENCE AS A SERIOUS OBSTACLE TO THE ARMED ORGANIZATIONS THEY PROMOTE AND THAT ARE TRAINED BY LIBYAN, BRITISH, CUBAN, AND ISRAELI EXPERTS. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT SOVEREIGNTY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT FOR THE EXISTENCE OF A STATE. HOWEVER, WE LOST OUR SOVEREIGNTY LONG AGO AND TO REGAIN IT WE MUST ACCEPT ALL THE AID THE HONEST INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CAN OFFER US. SOVEREIGNTY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MEANS ADOPTING DECISIONS BASED ON THE NEEDS OR PREFERENCES OF THE NATION AS A WHOLE. THAT STOPPED HAPPENING IN COLOMBIA WHEN THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS BEGAN TO INTIMIDATE AND DESTROY THE LEGITIMATE INSTITUTIONS OF THE STATE. HOW CAN WE TALK OF SOVEREIGNTY WHEN WE SEE THAT OUR PEOPLE HAVE FALLEN PREY TO TERRORISM; THAT THEY ARE LIVING AND DYING ENSLAVED BY DAILY BOMBINGS AND LIES; THAT THEY ARE GOVERNING UNDER THE PRESSURE OF THREATS; THAT THEY HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE IN A HOME IMPRISONED BY FEAR? IT IS ABSURD TO TALK OF A TRULY SOVEREIGN STATE WHEN IT IS KNOWN THAT SEVERAL OF THE COUNTRY'S TOP POLITICAL AND BUSINESS LEADERS ARE INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES. AN ACT OF SOVEREIGNTY -- ONE IN THE MIDST OF SO MUCH SUBJUGATION -- WOULD BE TO STRIP OURSELVES OF SO MUCH VAIN PRIDE AND ACCEPT THE FACT THAT WE ARE WEAK AND NEED ALL THE HELP OFFERED BY ANYONE WHOSE INTENTIONS ARE BASED ON THE LAW. MOREOVER, IT IS IRONIC THAT SEVERAL OF THOSE WHO ARE CLAMORING FOR "THE DEFENSE OF SOVEREIGNTY" ARE THE SAME ONES WHO ARE NOW ASKING THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TO EXPLAIN THE CANCELLATION OF VISAS. IS IT NOT A MATTER OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY TO DECIDE WHO CAN AND CANNOT ENTER THAT COUNTRY? I AM REMINDED OF THOSE THOUSANDS OF CASES OF FOOD AND MEDICINE DONATED TO COLOMBIA FOLLOWING THE ARMERO CATASTROPHE THAT ROTTED IN THE COUNTRY'S CUSTOMS WAREHOUSES. ARMERO IS THE BURIAL GROUND FOR 30,000 COLOMBIANS AND THE SCENE OF THE TRAGEDY OF THOUSANDS MORE. DESPITE THE REGRETTABLE END THAT THIS AID MET IN SO MANY WAREHOUSES, NOBODY OPPOSED INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY WITH THAT CORNER OF TOLIMA DEPARTMENT. THE WAR ON DRUG TRAFFICKERS COULD BURY US. LET US STRUGGLE FOR SOVEREINGTY AND ACCEPT THE ADVICE OFFERED BY THE UNITED STATES, OR WE WILL END UP ROTTING IN A WAREHOUSE FILLED WITH WHITE POWDER.
DEV-MUC3-0539	BOGOTA, 1 OCT 89 -- THE COLOMBIAN NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY GUERRILLA MOVEMENT, WHICH KIDNAPPED SPANISH BUSINESSMAN PABLO MARTIN BERROCAL ALMOST 2 MONTHS AGO IN QUITO, IS DEMANDING 1 BILLION PESETAS RANSOM FOR HIS RELEASE. SOURCES CLOSE TO THE REBEL GROUP, THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS NOT JOINED THE GOVERNMENT'S PEACE PROCESS IN COLOMBIA, TOLD EFE THAT NEGOTIATIONS FOR HIS RELEASE ARE BEING CARRIED OUT IN AN UNIDENTIFIED BORDER TOWN. COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS, DISGUISED AS POLICEMEN, KIDNAPPED THE 55-YEAR-OLD BUSINESSMAN LAST 9 AUGUST AT THE HOTEL WHERE BERROCAL WAS STAYING IN THE DOWNTOWN SECTION OF THE ECUADORAN CAPITAL. THE SAME SOURCES STATED THAT BERROCAL'S WIFE, BLANCA PARADELA, AND A PARTNER ARE IN COLOMBIA NEGOTIATING FOR THE BUSINESSMAN'S RELEASE DIRECTLY WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ELN, A REBEL GROUP LED BY FORMER SPANISH PRIEST MANUEL PEREZ, THE ELN HAS NOT ANNOUNCED THE MOTIVE FOR THE KIDNAPPING. SOURCES CONSULTED WITH BY EFE CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE COLOMBIAN REBEL GROUP HAS ONLY ECONOMIC MOTIVES. BERROCAL OWNS A BULLFIGHTING RING IN QUITO AND HE PARTICIPATES WITH HIS BROTHER, BULLFIGHTING BUSINESSMAN LUIS MARTIN BERROCAL, IN LA SEPULVEDANA TRANSPORTATION COMPANY. NEITHER THE COLOMBIAN NATIONAL POLICE NOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY , CHARGED WITH THE COUNTRY'S SECRET INVESTIGATIONS, HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON MARTIN BERROCAL OR HIS ALLEGED PRESENCE IN THE COUNTRY. EFE HAS LEARNED THAT REPRESENTATIVES OF MARTIN BERROCAL, WHO WENT TO BOGOTA IN MID-SEPTEMBER, DID NOT GET IN CONTACT WITH THE COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES WHEN THEY PASSED THROUGH THIS CITY. THE ELN, A MARXIST-LENINIST ORIENTED GROUP THAT HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN ARMED STRUGGLE FOR 25 YEARS, HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY ITS ATTACKS ON THE COLOMBIAN OIL ENTERPRISE AND FREQUENT KIDNAPPINGS OF NEWSMEN AND POLITICIANS OF THE COUNTRY. THE GROUP HAS BEEN ACTIVE ALONG THE COLOMBIAN BORDER, ESPECIALLY AREAS THAT BORDER ECUADOR AND VENEZUELA.
DEV-MUC3-0540	JERUSALEM , 2 OCT 89 -- ISRAELI ANTITERROR SECURITY INSTRUCTORS IN PERU HAVE BEEN DECLARED PERSONA NON GRATA AND ARE NOT BEING ALLOWED TO ENTER PERU. THIS WAS LEARNED BY OUR CORRESPONDENT FROM SOURCES CLOSE TO ISRAELI COMPANIES DEALING WITH THE SALE OF SECURITY KNOW-HOW. THE LONDON OBSERVER, QUOTING PERUVIAN CONGRESS MEMBERS, REPORTED THAT EVIDENCE CONCERNING ISRAELI INVOLVEMENT IN THE TRAINING OF A RIGHT-WING TERRORIST ORGANIZATION IN LIMA DISAPPEARED FROM THE FILES OF A CONGRESSIONAL COMMISSION PROBING ISRAELI INVOLVEMENT IN PERU. OUR CORRESPONDENT HANAN 'AZRAN HAS MORE DETAILS: THE REPORTS IN THE LONDON OBSERVER APPARENTLY STEM FROM LEFT-WING CIRCLES AND PERUVIAN GUERRILLA GROUPS. THE MOST PROMINENT GROUP IS THE SHINING PATH, A GUERRILLA GROUP AIMING TO OVERTHROW THE REGIME. THESE CIRCLES CONTEND THAT ISRAELIS TRAIN WHAT THEY TERM THE RIGHT-WING DEATH, OR TERROR, SQUADS. THEY APPARENTLY REFER TO THE RODRIGO FRANCO COMMANDO UNITS, TO WHICH THE LIQUIDATION OF GUERRILLA MEMBERS AND OF OPPONENTS TO THE REGIME IS ATTRIBUTED. POLITICAL CIRCLES IN JERUSALEM HAVE SAID THAT THESE CLAIMS OF ISRAELI INVOLVEMENT IN THE TRAINING OF DEATH SQUADS ARE GROUNDLESS. ISRAELI COMPANIES ARE INVOLVED IN MILITARY TRAINING AND IN MANEUVERS IN PERU. ISRAELI EXPERTS HAVE SET UP THE PERUVIAN ARMY'S ANTITERROR SQUAD. ONE OF THE SQUAD'S FOUNDERS WAS GABI KOHEN, A FORMER ISRAEL POLICE ANTITERROR UNIT COMMANDER. GABI KOHEN WAS A PARTNER IN THE DAT COMPANY, WHICH OFFERED SIMILAR TRAINING AND INSTRUCTION SERVICES TO ADDITIONAL COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA AND ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD. DAT OPERATED IN PERU WITH THE PERMIT OF SIBAT, THE DEFENSE MINISTRY DEFENSE SALES DEPARTMENT. ONE MEMBER OF THE COMPANY WAS A SENIOR BORDER POLICE OFFICER, FORMER BORDER POLICE COMMANDER TZVI BAR, WHO RETIRED FROM THE COMPANY AFTER A SHORT PERIOD, TURNING TO OTHER ENTERPRISES. ONE COMPANY WITH DIVERSE OPERATIONS IN PERU WAS THE ISDS OWNED BY LEO GLASER, ALSO AN IDF ELITE UNIT GRADUATE. ISDS HAD PERMANENT OFFICES IN LIMA HEADED BY RAN GAZIT, WHO LATER OPENED A BUSINESS OF HIS OWN ELSEWHERE. THE COMPANY HAD DEFENSE MINISTRY APPROVAL FOR ITS WORK IN PERU. ACCORDING TO ITS DIRECTORS, IT TRAINED SECURITY GUARDS FOR CIVILIAN BUSINESSES ONLY, INCLUDING THE USE OF FIREARMS AND PROTECTION MEASURES.
DEV-MUC3-0541	LIMA, 2 OCT 89 -- THE GOVERNMENT TODAY PUT ITS FORCES OF ORDER ON MAXIMUM STATE OF ALERT DUE TO A SERIES OF ATTACKS BY "SHINING PATH" TERRORISTS. THE GOVERNMENT MADE THIS DECISION AFTER A CRUEL TERRORIST ATTACT IN PALPA, 350 KM SOUTH OF LIMA. THE AUTHORITIES ADDED THAT "EVERYTHING SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT THE MAOIST SHINING PATH MOVEMENT WILL CARRY OUT FURTHER ATTACKS ON THE EVE OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT TO BE HELD ON 11 AND 12 OCTOBER. IT WAS REPORTED THIS AFTERNOON THAT SPECIAL TROOPS HAVE BEEN SENT TO PALPA AND THAT ARMORED HELICOPTERS ARE ALREADY OVERFLYING THE AREA IN SEARCH OF THE ATTACKERS. POLICE TROOPS HAVE ALSO BEEN URGENTLY DISPATCHED TO OTHER AREAS WHERE THERE HAS BEEN TERRORIST ESCALATIONS. THE GOVERNMENT ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT "IT WILL GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF THE SUMMIT."
DEV-MUC3-0542	BOGOTA, 3 OCT 89 -- THE AUTHORITIES OF THE EASTERN DEPARTMENT OF ARAUCA, IN THE OIL PRODUCING SECTOR OF THE COUNTRY, HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT MSGR JESUS EMILIO JARAMILLO WAS MURDERED AND THAT HIS BODY WAS FOUND TODAY. THE AUTHORITIES BLAMED THE LEFTIST ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION GUERRILLAS FOR THE MURDER. YESTERDAY SEVERAL ARMED MEN KIDNAPPED JARAMILLO, THE BISHOP OF ARAUCA, AND HIS ASSISTANT, ELMER MUNOZ, BUT LATER RELEASED THE LATTER. GENERAL RAFAEL PADILLA, COMMANDER OF THE 2D ARMY DIVISION, CONFIRMED THAT BISHOP JARAMILLO DIED FROM TWO GUNSHOTS TO THE HEAD. HE BLAMED THE ELN'S DOMINGO LAIN FRONT FOR THE CRIME. GEN PADILLA PRAISED MSGR JARAMILLO'S WORK OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS IN FAVOR OF THE POOR IN ARAUCA DEPARTMENT, BUT DID NOT EXPLAIN WHAT REASONS THE GUERRILLAS COULD HAVE HAD FOR MURDERING THE PRELATE. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT A CHURCH OFFICIAL OF SUCH HIGH RANKING HAS BEEN MURDERED IN COLOMBIA. THE ELN, THE MOST ACTIVE AND VIOLENT GUERRILLA GROUP IN THE COUNTRY, HAS REPEATEDLY REJECTED THE OFFERS OF PEACE FROM THE LIBERAL ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO. THE ELN--WHICH IS LED BY MANUEL PEREZ, A SPANISH CITIZEN AND FORMER PRIEST--HAS MADE THE COUNTRY'S OIL INFRASTRUCTURE THE MAIN TARGET OF ITS TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.
DEV-MUC3-0543	SANTIAGO, NO DATE -- GROUPS HOLDING THE SAME POLICIES THAT FAILED IN CHILE AT THE END OF THE 1960'S AND THE BEGINNING OF THE 1970'S WERE ABLE TO ESTABLISH THEMSELVES IN OTHER PLACES. NOW WE ARE WITNESSING THE COLLAPSE OF THE ILLUSIONS AND OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF TOTALITARIAN AND COLLECTIVIST SYSTEMS. IT SEEMS THAT PEACE IS BEING CONSOLIDATED. THE WORLD POWERS HAVE AGREED TO WORK FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND MORE RATIONAL RELATIONS. THE WORLD IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY INTERDEPENDENT. OUR MODERN KNOWLEDGE, SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND RESOURCES HAVE OVERCOME BORDERS AND LIMITATIONS. THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. THESE PROBLEMS, THEREFORE, ARE A CHALLENGE FOR WORLD COOPERATION AND THIS ORGANIZATION. ONE OF THE GREATEST CHALLENGES FACING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TODAY IS THE DRAFTING OF EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING. WE SUPPORT COLOMBIA FOR ITS COURAGE TO FACE THE POWERFUL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE USING THE NATION FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES. CHILE HAS IMPLEMENTED A STRICT PREVENTIVE PROGRAM TO CONTROL THE MOST DANGEROUS MANIFESTATIONS OF THE PROBLEM. WE ARE NOT A DRUG PRODUCING COUNTRY. WE ARE VICTIMS OF DRUG TRAFFICKING. IN ONE OF ITS FIRST DECISIONS ON THE PROBLEM, IN SEPTEMBER 1973, THE GOVERNMENT EXPELLED A GROUP OF FOREIGN DRUG TRAFFICKERS WHO HAD ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN NORTHERN CHILE, TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PREVAILING POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CRISIS. WE ARE CONVINCED THAT COUNTRIES CANNOT FIGHT THE PROBLEM ALONE. THE WORLD HAS DECLARED WAR ON DRUGS. WE MUST BE AWARE THAT TRANSITORY VICTORIES WILL NOT ERADICATE THE PROBLEM. ONLY WITH PROPER EDUCATION WILL WE BE ABLE TO NURTURE THE STRENGTH OF OUR YOUTH, ALERT THEM TO THE DANGERS OF DRUG CONSUMPTION, AND PREVENT THEM FROM BECOMING VICTIMS. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST ASSIGN THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT EFFICIENT EDUCATION PROGRAMS. WE HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT TERRORISM FOR MANY YEARS. TODAY WE WANT TO REITERATE OUR REJECTION AND REPUDIATION OF TERRORISM. CHILEANS ARE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO TERRORISM BECAUSE WE CONTINUOUSLY EXPERIENCE THEIR COWARDLY AND IRRESPONSIBLE ATTACKS. WE HAVE OFTEN SEEN HOW SOME NATIONS RECEIVE CONFESSED TERRORISTS WHO ASK FOR POLITICAL ASYLUM. IF MODERN SOCIETIES WANT TO DEFEAT TERRORISM AND NARCOTERRORISM, THEY WILL HAVE TO ACT DECISIVELY. TERRORISTS SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN REFUGE OR PROTECTION ANYWHERE. SOME INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE PERMITTED THE SYSTEMATIC MANIPULATION OF THE ISSUE OF HUMAN RIGHTS FOR POLITICAL REASONS. THE PARTIES INVOLVED IN SUCH MANIPULATION HAVE TRIED TO INCLUDE THE LEGITIMATE RIGHT OF A NATION TO DEFEND ITSELF FROM TERRORISM AND SUBVERSION IN THE DEFINITION OF HUMAN RIGHT VIOLATIONS. IT IS NOT THAT WE DENY THE INALIENABLE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE. WE CONDEMN THE GROSS MANIPULATION OF THE ISSUE OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS MANIPULATION SHOWS THAT THOSE PARTIES DO NOT RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS THEMSELVES. HUMAN RIGHTS SHOULD BE RESPECTED BY ALL NATIONS WITHOUT EXCEPTION. IT IS NOT FAIR TO PASS JUDGMENT ON COUNTRIES LIKE CHILE THAT HAD TO STRUGGLE HARD TO OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTIES CREATED BY TERRORISM AND SUBVERSION. TERRORISM SET FOOT IN CHILE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF DISRUPTION IN THE INSTITUTIONAL ORDER BETWEEN 1970 AND 1973. THOSE PASSING JUDGMENT MUST CONSIDER THE GENERAL SITUATION THAT PROVOKED THE COLLAPSE OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE. IN CHILE WE HAVE BUILT A SOCIETY IN WHICH HUMAN RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED NOT ONLY BY DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND THE LAW, BUT ALSO BY THE CHILEAN PEOPLE'S WILLINGNESS TO RESPECT INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, VALUES, AND BELIEFS. THOSE RIGHTS ARE ALSO PROTECTED BY TODAY'S SPIRIT OF COEXISTENCE.
DEV-MUC3-0544	GUATEMALA CITY, 5 OCT 89 -- GUATEMALAN SECURITY FORCES TODAY DECLARED A "GENERAL ALERT" AFTER A RADIO STATION IN THE CAPITAL RECEIVED A PHONE CALL IN WHICH AN UNIDENTIFIED PERSON THREATENED A GENERALIZED ATTACK ON RADIO STATIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. ODILIO DELEON, 42, AN ANNOUNCER FOR RADIO CULTURAL, TOLD THE POLICE THAT HE RECEIVED A PHONE CALL YESTERDAY IN WHICH AN ATTACK ON RADIO STATIONS WAS THREATENED. NO REASON FOR THE THREAT WAS GIVEN. POLICE SOURCES SAID THAT IN VIEW OF THIS REPORT, SECURITY FORCES WERE ALERTED AND INVESTIGATIONS BEGUN TO IDENTIFY THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS PLAN. OVER 20 MONTHS AGO, THE OPERATOR OF A TRANMISSION TOWER FOR CHANNEL 7 TELEVISION WAS KILLED BY A HIGH-POWERED BOMB DETONATED BY UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS. THE HOME OF ROLANDO ARCHILA, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF GUATEMALA'S EMISORAS UNIDAS, THE RADIO STATION WITH THE LARGEST AUDIENCE IN THE COUNTRY, WAS DAMAGED IN A TERRORIST ATTACK. THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT ATTRIBUTED THESE ACTIONS TO "EXTREME RIGHTIST" GROUPS SEEKING TO "DESTABILIZE THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS INITIATED IN JANUARY, 1986," AFTER 2 DECADES OF MILITARY REGIMES. SO FAR, IT IS NOT KNOWN IF THE THREAT TO THE RADIO STATIONS WAS MADE BY THOSE GROUPS, OR IF IT CAME FROM THE EXTREME LEFT .
DEV-MUC3-0545	LIMA, 4 OCT 89 -- PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA HAS ASKED SOME EUROPEAN NATIONS TO ATTEND THE PRESIDENTIAL MEETING OF THE COCA PRODUCING COUNTRIES AND U.S. AUTHORITIES AT WHICH THE DRUG TRAFFICKING ISSUE WILL BE DISCUSSED. GARCIA SAID THAT THE PROPOSAL WAS ADDRESSED TO THE FRENCH, ITALIAN, AND SPANISH CHIEFS OF STATE, FRANCOIS MITTERRAND, GIULIO ANDREOTTI, AND FELIPE GONZALEZ, RESPECTIVELY. DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE TO FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS, ALAN GARCIA SAID THAT EUROPE MUST ATTEND THIS MEETING BECAUSE IT IS A STRONG DRUG MARKET AND BECAUSE OF THE LINKS BETWEEN DRUG TRAFFICKING GANGS AND TERRORISTS. GARCIA CRITICIZED THE PLAN PROPOSED BY WILLIAM BENNETT, THE WHITE HOUSE'S MAIN ADVISER FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING AFFAIRS, ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT "LACKS SERIOUSNESS AND IS INCONCEIVABLE." THE PLAN PROVIDES FOR $250 MILLION IN AID FOR COLOMBIA, BOLIVIA, AND PERU FOR FIGHTING DRUG TRAFFICKING IN 1990. THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT SAID THAT THIS AMOUNT IS "RIDICULOUS" IF COMPARED WITH THE $8 BILLION THAT THE BENNETT PLAN ASSIGNS FOR FIGHTING DRUG TRAFFICKING IN THE UNITED STATES, AND WITH THE U.S. $300 BILLION MILITARY BUDGET. ALAN GARCIA CRITICIZED THE FACT THAT THE UNITED STATES GAVE COLOMBIA "PLANES FROM THE KOREAN WAR ERA AND OLD HELICOPTERS THAT WERE USED HERE ." HE SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD NOT FORM ALLIANCES WITH GOVERNMENTS BUT WITH COCA FARMERS, AND THAT IT SHOULD IMPLEMENT COMPREHENSIVE REPLACEMENT PROGRAMS INCLUDING GUARANTEED SALES. "PERU DOES NOT HAVE DRUG ADDICTION PROBLEMS, BUT AN AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM WHICH HAS BEEN DISTORTED BY THE U.S. DEMAND," ALAN GARCIA ADDED, NOTING THAT THE MOST FERTILE PERUVIAN LAND IS DEDICATED TO COCA FARMING. ALAN GARCIA SAID THAT IF THE 200,000 HECTARES OF COCA FARMS IN PERU ARE "DRASTICALLY ERADICATED," MORE THAN 400,000 PEASANTS WILL BE LEFT "IN ABSOLUTE MISERY," ADDING THAT THESE PEASANTS MAY JOIN THE SUBVERSIVE GROUPS OPERATING IN THE COCA PRODUCING ZONE OF ALTO HUALLAGA, IN THE AMAZONIAN REGION. "IF THE UNITED STATES HAS LIVED WITH DRUG ADDICTION FOR DECADES, I DON'T SEE WHY IT NOW WANTS TO DROP KIND OF ATOMIC BOMB ON THE HUALLAGA ZONE," HE ADDED. THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT DECLINED TO COMMENT ON A U.S. CHARGE THAT GENERAL GUILLERMO ARCINIEGAS, CHIEF OF THE HUALLAGA MILITARY ZONE, HAS USED DRUG TRAFFICKERS' MONEY TO FIGHT TERRORISTS. "JUST AS WE HAVE NEVER SAID THAT U.S. OFFICIALS OR POLICEMEN ARE ACCOMPLICES WITH DRUG ADDICTS, WE CANNOT TOLERATE THE CHARGE THAT THOSE WHO FIGHT SUBVERSION IN PERU ARE ACCOMPLICES WITH DRUG PRODUCERS," HE NOTED.
DEV-MUC3-0546	SAN SALVADOR, 5 OCT 89 -- SOME 80 MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS OF THE FEDERATION OF COMMITTEES OF MOTHERS OF POLITICAL PRISONERS TODAY "FORCIBLY" OCCUPIED THE COSTA RICAN EMBASSY IN SAN SALVADOR TO DENOUNCE "THE REPRESSION OF THE FASCIST GOVERNMENT" OF EL SALVADOR. COSTA RICAN AMBASSADOR JESUS FERNANDEZ, WHO CONSIDERS HIMSELF A HOSTAGE, SAID THAT THE EMBASSY WAS "TAKEN OVER BY FORCE BY ARMED INDIVIDUALS" WHILE ALL OF ITS PERSONNEL AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WERE INSIDE THE BUILDING. A MEMBER OF THE FECMAFAN TOLD NEWSMEN THAT "THE PURPOSE OF THIS OCCUPATION IS TO DENOUNCE BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT OF NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNER OSCAR ARIAS AND BEFORE THE OTHER GOVERNMENTS OF THE WORLD, THE REPRESSION TO WHICH THE PEOPLE'S ORGANIZATIONS IN EL SALVADOR ARE BEING SUBJECTED." THE FECMAFAN MEMBER ADDED THAT THE OCCUPATION IS ALSO BEING USED TO REACH THESE GOVERNMENTS TO ASK THEM TO APPLY PRESSURE ON SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI TO GET HIM TO ENSURE RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. AMBASSADOR FERNANDEZ SAID: "THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS OCCUPATION, BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS MET WITH ALL SECTORS. THIS IS HARDLY THE TREATMENT THAT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS SHOWN EXTREME CONCERN IN SEEKING A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT." IN ADDITION TO AMBASSADOR FERNANDEZ, CONSUL HUMBERTO MURILLO, COUNSELOR CARLOTA DE LOPEZ, AND FIRST SECRETARY LUIS DE ANDA ARE INSIDE THE 54-SQUARE-METER OFFICE, AS WELL AS 10 PERSONS WHO WERE SEEKING VISAS. DE ANDA TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT HE WAS HIT ON THE LEFT HAND WHEN THE OCCUPIERS TRIED TO OPEN HIS DESK DRAWER. THE DOORS TO THE EMBASSY, WHICH IS IN A 10-STORY BUILDING IN WESTERN SAN SALVADOR, ARE CLOSED, AND THE OFFICES ARE OCCUPIED BY WOMEN WITH WHITE SCARVES ON THEIR HEADS AND YOUTHS WHOSE FACES ARE COVERED WITH SCARVES AND GLASSES. FECMAFAN MEMBERS, WHO CLAIM THAT THEY ARE NOT CARRYING WEAPONS, ARE GUARDING THE ELEVATOR AND THE DOORS LEADING TO THE EMBASSY. HOWEVER, CONSUL MURILLO SAID THAT HE SAW SEVERAL YOUTHS ARMED WITH .38-CALIBER REVOLVERS AND EXPLOSIVE DEVICES. ACCORDING TO A FECMAFAN MEMBER, OVER THE PAST 3 MONTHS, SOME 150 PERSONS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND MORE THAN 500 HAVE BEEN ARRESTED OR MADE TO DISAPPEAR. ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE GROUP SAID: "WE ARE PROTESTING THE LIMITATION OF FREEDOMS IN EL SALVADOR. IF WE TAKE TO THE STREETS TO PROTEST WE ARE ARRESTED." THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT HE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HIS GOVERNMENT, BECAUSE "I AM BEING PREVENTED FROM MAKING PHONE CALLS AND FROM LEAVING THE EMBASSY." THE OCCUPIERS ALLOWED FIVE PEOPLE, INCLUDING A PREGNANT WOMAN, TO LEAVE THE PREMISES AND SAID THAT THEY PLANNED TO STAY IN THE EMBASSY INDEFINITELY.
DEV-MUC3-0547	SAN SALVADOR, 5 OCT 89 -- APPROXIMATELY 50 SALVADORAN LEFTIST ACTIVISTS DEMANDED THE MEDIATION OF COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS AS A CONDITION TO LEAVE THE COSTA RICAN EMBASSY WHICH THEY FORCEFULLY OCCUPIED ON THE MORNING OF 3 OCTOBER. DATE AS RECEIVED JAMIN DE FERNANDEZ, THE WIFE OF THE COSTA RICAN AMBASSADOR, REPORTED THIS TO AFP OVER THE TELEPHONE. COSTA RICAN AMBASSADOR JESUS FERNANDEZ AND TWO OTHER DIPLOMATIC OFFICIALS ARE BEING HELD HOSTAGE BY MEMBERS OF THE MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO FEDERATION OF COMMITTEES OF MOTHERS AND RELATIVES OF POLITICAL PRISONERS AND MISSING PEOPLE. SOME OF THESE FECMAFAM MEMBERS ARE CARRYING GUNS AND INCENDIARY BOMBS. INITIALLY, THE FECMAFAM MEMBERS, WHO INCLUDE SEVERAL WOMEN, SAID THAT THE EMBASSY TAKEOVER WAS INTENDED TO "REPORT THE REPRESSION BY ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S RIGHTIST GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER, MRS FERNANDEZ, WHO REMAINS IN HER HOME, SAID THAT THIS AFTERNOON HER HUSBAND PHONED HER AND STATED THAT THE FECMAFAM PEOPLE "DEMAND TO SPEAK WITH PRESIDENT ARIAS SO THAT HE WILL DELIVER A LIST OF DEMANDS TO CRISTIANI." THE CONTENTS OF THIS LIST IS UNKNOWN. PRESIDENT ARIAS IS CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA.
DEV-MUC3-0548	AYACUCHO, 5 OCT 89 -- AYACUCHO MILITARY SOURCES TODAY REPORTED THAT 35 PEOPLE DIED IN ATTACKS BY ABOUT 150 SHINING PATH MEMBERS AGAINST 4 TOWNS ON THE BORDER OF AYACUCHO AND HUANCAVELICA DEPARTMENTS.

THESE ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT IN SEVERAL PARTS OF THE CITY, AND ONE OF THEM WAS AGAINST THE NATIONAL POLICE HEADQUARTERS, WHICH IS LOCATED AT 300 METERS FROM THE MAIN SQUARE. THERE WERE GUNSHOTS AND EXPLOSIONS AT THE POLICE HEADQUARTERS, BUT NO VICTIMS WERE REPORTED.

EXPLOSIONS WERE HEARD IN THE CARMEN ALTO, SAN JUAN BAUTISTA, MAGDALENA, CAPILLAPATA, AND CONCHOPATA NEIGHBORHOODS AND AT THE SAN CRISTOBAL DE HUAMANGA UNIVERSITY. THESE ATTACKS LAUNCHED BY THE SHINING PATH IN AYACUCHO OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS ARE PART OF THE ESCALATING VIOLENCE THAT HAS AFFECTED SEVERAL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY ONLY 5 DAYS BEFORE THE START OF TWO PRESIDENTIAL "SUMMITS" THAT WILL BE HELD IN ICA DEPARTMENT, LOCATED IN THE SOUTHERN REGION OF PERU. THE PRESIDENTS OF BOLIVIA, COLOMBIA, AND PERU ARE SCHEDULED TO MEET TO DISCUSS THE DRUG TRAFFICKING ISSUE ON 10 OCTOBER IN PARACAS. THE "GROUP OF EIGHT" SUMMIT, , IS SCHEDULED TO BE HELD 11-12 OCTOBER IN ICA, THE CAPITAL OF THE DEPARTMENT.
DEV-MUC3-0549	SAN SALVADOR, 6 OCT 89 -- THE MEDIATION OF ARCHBISHOP ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS COULD END THE OCCUPATION BY 20 MEMBERS OF AN OPPOSITION HUMANITARIAN GROUP OF THE COSTA RICAN EMBASSY IN SAN SALVADOR IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS. THE GROUP BELONGING TO THE FEDERATION OF COMMITTEES OF MOTHERS AND RELATIVES OF POLITICAL PRISONERS, MISSING, AND MURDERED PEOPLE OCCUPIED THE EMBASSY ON 5 OCTOBER TO DEMAND "AN END TO THE GOVERNMENT'S REPRESSIVE ESCALATION." ON THE EVENING OF 5 OCTOBER, THE SALVADORAN PRELATE VISITED THE BUILDING WHERE COSTA RICAN AMBASSADOR JESUS FERNANDEZ, CONSUL HUMBERTO MURILLO, AND FIRST SECRETARY LUIS DE ANDA ARE BEING HELD HOSTAGE TO PERSONALLY ASSESS THE SITUATION INSIDE IN THE DIPLOMATIC HEADQUARTERS. AMBASSADOR FERNANDEZ MET WITH THE ARCHBISHOP ON THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE "LA CENTROAMERICANA" BUILDING, WHICH HOUSES THE COSTA RICAN EMBASSY, BUT MILITARY MEN DID NOT ALLOW HIM TO REACH THE THIRD FLOOR WHERE EMBASSY OFFICES ACTUALLY ARE. RIVERA Y DAMAS POINTED OUT THAT "I NEED TO OBTAIN AN ARMY PERMIT TO ENTER THE EMBASSY." POLICE DEPUTY DIRECTOR COLONEL ALEJANDRO SANCHEZ SAID THAT THE CONFLICT COULD END IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS. THE ARMED FORCES HAVE RULED OUT MILITARY INTERVENTION TO EVICT THE EMBASSY OCCUPANTS, BUT ARE USING "DISSUASIVE" ACTIONS TO PROMPT THEM TO LEAVE. MEANWHILE, THE GROUP MAINTAINS THAT IT WILL NOT END ITS OCCUPATION "UNTIL THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT MEDIATES TO ENSURE THAT OUR COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENT WILL END THE REPRESSION" AND THE ANTIRIOT POLICE LEAVE THE AREA. NINE YOUNG WOMEN AND 11 YOUNG MEN ARE INVOLVED IN THE OCCUPATION. SOME OF THEM ARE "CARRYING WEAPONS," CONSUL HUMBERTO MURILLO SAID. FECMAFAN CALLED FOR A MARCH THIS MORNING BEGINNING AT THE "LAS AMERICAS" PLAZA, ABOUT 200 METERS FROM THE COSTA RICAN EMBASSY, TO DEMAND THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT "RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS" AND END THE EMBASSY OCCUPATION. MEANWHILE, THE ARMED FORCES TODAY BEEFED UP SECURITY IN SAN SALVADOR BY POSTING ADDITIONAL TROOPS ON AVENUES AND AT BUILDINGS, AND SEARCHING VEHICLES AS PART OF OPERATION "ATLACATL II," WHICH IS BEING IMPLEMENTED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY TO PREVENT "TERRORIST" ACTIONS.
DEV-MUC3-0550	BOGOTA, 6 OCT 89 -- TWO TERRORIST BOMBINGS IN NORTHERN BOGOTA HAVE WOUNDED SIX PERSONS AND CAUSED CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE. THE COMMANDER OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE REPORTED THAT THE FIRST BOMB WAS PLACED AT A COLPATRIA BANK BRANCH ON 86TH STREET AND 15TH AVENUE. THIS BOMB CAUSED HEAVY DAMAGE TO THE BANK AND WOUNDED SIX PASSERSBY. THE WOUNDED WERE TAKEN TO THE COUNTRY CLUB CLINIC, WHERE THEY WERE TREATED AND RELEASED. THE SECOND BOMB WAS PLACED BY A YOUNG MAN AT THE TELEPHONE COMPANY OFFICE ON 91ST STREET AND 15TH AVENUE, CAUSING CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE. THE YOUNG MAN THEN ENTERED A NEARBY CARULLA SUPERMARKET, WHERE CITIZENS CAPTURED HIM.
DEV-MUC3-0551	BOGOTA, 6 OCT 89 -- FOUR MEN, WHO HAD 250 KG OF DYNAMITE WITH THEM, WERE ARRESTED TODAY BY THE BOGOTA POLICE WHO SAID THEY HAD DISMANTLED A BAND OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE SOWING TERROR IN THIS CITY. IN ORDER NOT TO HINDER THE INVESTIGATIONS, THE POLICE DID NOT DISCLOSE THE NAMES OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE CAPTURED DURING THE INTELLIGENCE OPERATION IN SOUTHWESTERN BOGOTA. A POLICE SPOKESMAN REPORTED THAT THE FOUR MEN WERE ARRESTED, FOLLOWING THE 5 OCTOBER ARREST OF A MAN WHO WAS CARRYING 15 KG OF DYNAMITE IN A TAXI. SHORTLY BEFORE THAT, ANOTHER TERRORIST WAS NEARLY LYNCHED BY SOME PEOPLE WHO CAPTURED HIM IN NORTHERN BOGOTA, AFTER HE PLACED AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE IN A PRINTSHOP. A POLICE PATROL WENT TO THE SITE AND PREVENTED THE PRIVATE CITIZENS AND BUSINESSMEN AFFECTED BY THE BOMBS FROM SERIOUSLY HARMING THE MAN WHO WAS, NONETHELESS, SEVERELY BEATEN. THE BOGOTA POLICE SAID THAT THE ARREST OF THESE SIX TERRORISTS IN THE LAST 24 HOURS AIDED IN UNCOVERING A PLAN TO DESTROY AN ELECTRICAL GENERATING CENTER. A POLICE SPOKESMAN REPORTED THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WERE ARRESTED, THANKS TO THE COOPERATION OF THE PEOPLE. HE EMPHASIZED THAT THE QUICK REACTION BY A GROUP OF BUSINESSMEN LED TO THE ARREST OF ONE OF THE TERRORISTS. THE SECOND TERRORIST WAS ARRESTED BY THE POLICE AFTER A TAXI DRIVER REFUSED TO PROVIDE SERVICE AND REPORTED HIM AS A SUSPECT. WHEN THE SUSPECT WAS INTERROGATED, HE DISCLOSED INFORMATION THAT ALLOWED THE POLICE TO LOCATE A HOUSE IN SOUTHERN BOGOTA WHERE FOUR MEN WERE HIDING 250 KG OF DYNAMITE. THE TERRORISM AFFECTING SEVERAL COLOMBIAN CITIES IS THE RESPONSE FROM DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO WHO DECLARED WAR ON THEM IN AUGUST.
DEV-MUC3-0552	AYACUCHO, 4 OCT 89 -- ACCORDING TO MILITARY SOURCES TODAY, THREE MEMBERS OF THE PEASANT DEFENSE PATROLS WERE MURDERED BY A COLUMN OF SHINING PATH MEMBERS, AND ANOTHER TWO WERE WOUNDED DURING AN ATTACK ON HUANTA TOWN IN AYACUCHO PROVINCE. ON 3 OCTOBER THE TERRORISTS INVADED CALLUCHACA VILLAGE, 7 KM NORTHEAST OF HUANTA, AND ATTACKED THE MEMBERS OF THE LOCAL "PEASANT DEFENSE PATROLS," AMONG THEM THEIR 38-YEAR OLD PRESIDENT FIDEL QUISPE, AND SET THEIR HOUSES ON FIRE. A A RESULT OF THE ATTACK QUISPE, ISIDORO SAUNE, AND DIONISIO AGUIRRE WERE KILLED. FEDERICO PAQUILLAUVI AND CIRILO QUISPE WERE WOUNDED ACCORDING TO THE SOURCES. MEMBERS OF THE PEASANT DEFENSE PATROLS, IN ADDITION TO OPPOSING THE MEMBERS OF THE SHINING PATH, PARTICIPATE IN THE PERUVIAN FLAG RAISING CEREMONY EVERY SUNDAY AT THE PLAZA DE ARMAS IN HUANTAS. THE CEREMONY IS HEADED BY THE LOCAL MILITARY AUTHORITIES.
DEV-MUC3-0553	LIMA, 6 OCT 89 -- GUILLERMO LARCO COX, PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS AND FOREIGN MINISTER, TODAY REITERATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT NEGOTIATE WITH THE KIDNAPPERS OF TELEVISION MANAGER HECTOR DELGADO PARKER BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT'S LEGITIMACY ITSELF WOULD BE AT STAKE. LARCO COX ALSO SAID THAT THE MEETING OF GROUP OF EIGHT PRESIDENTS WILL BE HELD AS PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS IMPLEMENTING EXTREME SECURITY MEASURES TO GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF VISITING DIGNITARIES AND OFFICIALS. HAS THE MEETING BETWEEN THE PRESIDENTS OF BOLIVIA, PERU, AND COLOMBIA BEEN MOVED FROM PARACAS? IT IS A MATTER OF LOGISTICS. THE ORGANIZATION OF THE TWO MEETINGS IN PARACAS AND LAS DUNAS OVER 2 CONSECUTIVE DAYS WOULD HAVE MEANT A DUPLICATION OF EFFORTS IN GUARANTEEING PROPER COMMUNICATIONS. THIS IS THE ONLY REASON WE HAVE MOVED THE SITE OF THE FIRST MEETING. I HAVE JUST HAD A MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADORS OF THE COUNTRIES MAKING UP THE GROUP OF EIGHT. WE EXPLAINED TO THEM ALL THE SECURITY MEASURES WE ARE IMPLEMENTING, NOT ONLY FOR THE PERSONAL SECURITY OF DIGNITARIES BUT ALSO FOR THE SECURITY OF THE BUILDINGS IN WHICH THE MEETINGS WILL BE HELD. PERU'S IMAGE IS AT STAKE. WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL TO PROTECT THIS IMAGE. HAS THE MEETING IN TRUJILLO BEEN CANCELED? WE SHOULD NOT FORGET THAT WE LIVE IN A CITY WHERE RUMORS THRIVE LIKE MUSHROOMS. I WOULD NOT SAY THE COUNTRY IS LIKE THAT, BUT IT IS TRUE THAT RUMORS IN THIS CITY USUALLY SPREAD OUT OF CONTROL. THE MEETING IN TRUJILLO WILL BE HELD. I AM PERSONALLY PROUD OF IT. WHERE WILL THE MEETING BETWEEN THE PRESIDENTS OF PERU, BOLIVIA, AND COLOMBIA BE HELD? IN ICA, IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE THE GROUP OF EIGHT WILL MEET THE NEXT DAY. WILL THE GROUP OF EIGHT DISCUSS THE SITUATION IN PANAMA? IT IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES ON OUR AGENDA. LET US NOT FORGET THAT PANAMA IS ONE OF THE COFOUNDERS OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT. THE GROUP OF EIGHT IS NOW MORE APPROPRIATELY CALLED THE MECHANISM FOR POLITICAL CONSULTATION AND AGREEMENT, BUT IT WAS ORIGINALLY MADE UP OF THE CONTADORA GROUP, OF WHICH PANAMA WAS A MEMBER, AND THE CONTADORA SUPPORT GROUP, WHICH WAS FOUNDED IN LIMA WHEN ALAN GARCIA TOOK OVER. THE SECURITY OF THE PRESIDENTS IS OF GREAT CONCERN. IS EACH ONE ARRIVING WITH THEIR OWN SECURITY? ARE THERE EXCEPTIONAL MEASURES BEING IMPLEMENTED? THE DIGNITARIES MIGHT BRING THEIR OWN PERSONAL SECURITY FORCES. HOWEVER, OUR COUNTRY WILL GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF THE AREA, THE BUILDINGS, AND THEIR PERSONAL SECURITY. FOREIGN SOURCES HAVE BEEN SPECULATING THAT SOME PRESIDENTS MIGHT NOT COME. WHAT CAN YOU SAY AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE HOST COUNTRY? THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS TO CALL THE AMBASSADORS OF THESE COUNTRIES TO A MEETING BECAUSE THEY ALSO HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO OBSERVE AND ASSESS OUR GUARANTEES. THE RESULT OF THE MEETING WAS VERY POSITIVE; THEY SUPPORTED US WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS. THE AMBASSADORS HAVE FOUND OUR EXPLANATION ON THE SECURITY MEASURES BEING IMPLEMENTED VERY SATISFACTORY. THESE MEASURES WENT INTO EFFECT TODAY. SOME OF YOU MIGHT HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED THE OPERATIONS: WE ARE NOT ONLY STOPPING TRAFFIC TO CHECK CARS, LUGGAGE, AND PEOPLE TRAVELING ON BUSES, BUT WE HAVE ALSO KEPT A CLOSE WATCH ON NEWCOMERS. ALL FOREIGNERS WHO HAVE ARRIVED IN THE COUNTRY OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS ARE BEING WATCHED. POLICE ARE CHECKING TO SEE IF THEY ARE IN THE HOTELS WHERE THEY SAID THEY WOULD BE. THESE OPERATIONS ARE AIMED AT PREVENTING ANY EXTERNAL AGGRESSION. WE ALSO HAVE OUR OWN RISKS, AND MANY MEN FROM THE NATIONAL POLICE AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE INVOLVED IN THE SECURITY OPERATIONS THAT BEGAN AT NOON TODAY.
DEV-MUC3-0554	LA RIOJA, 7 OCT 89 -- TODAY PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM SAID THAT HE IS WILLING TO ACCEPT "ALL THE POLITICAL COSTS THAT MAY EMERGE" FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL PARDON TO MILITARY MEN AND CIVILIANS WHO VIOLATED HUMAN RIGHTS. THE PARDON WAS ORDERED WITH THE SIGNING OF SEVERAL DECREES TODAY. MENEM TALKED WITH REPORTERS ABOUT THE PARDON. HE SAID: "I CANNOT ESTIMATE WHAT THE POLITICAL COSTS WILL BE. I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THEY WILL BE MANY OR NOT BUT I WILL ASSUME MY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COSTS. WHAT INTERESTS ME IS MY COUNTRY, MY PEOPLE." MENEM ADDED: "ACQUITTAL MEANS PARDON, AND FROM NOW ON ALL THOSE WHO RECENTLY VIOLATED HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE BEEN PARDONED." MENEM SAID THAT IT IS "BASICALLY" IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US "TO BE ABLE TO BUILD AN ARGENTINA WHERE IT WILL BE WORTH LIVING." REGARDING THOSE PARDONED, MENEM SAID THAT HE WISHED THEM WELL AND THAT "THEY SHOULD WORK IN PEACE HERE IN ARGENTINA OR ANYWHERE ELSE." HE INDICATED THAT HE IS WILLING "WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS TO MEET WITH THEM" BECAUSE "IF THE PRESIDENT PARDONED THEM IN THE NAME OF WHAT HE REPRESENTS AND IF IN SOME WAY HE REPRESENTS THE LAW AND A LARGE SECTOR OF THE COMMUNITY, THEN I AM WILLING TO TALK WITH ANYONE WHO WANTS." HE DENIED HAVING BEEN PRESSURED TO IMPLEMENT THE PARDON QUICKLY "EITHER BY THE ARMED FORCES OR CIVILIANS." HE POINTED OUT THAT "THERE IS A MAN WHO DID NOT GET THE BENEFIT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL PARDON; HE IS ADMIRAL ARMANDO LAMBRUSCHINI WHOSE 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER WAS MURDERED BY A BOMB. THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHEM MEASURES OF THIS TYPE ARE IMPLEMENTED." MENEM CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT "THIS MEASURE WHICH I TAKE UNDER MY RESPONSIBILITY HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE JUSTICIALIST PARTY AND OTHER PARTIES IN ADDITION TO A VERY IMPORTANT SECTOR OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND OTHER RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS."
DEV-MUC3-0555	BOGOTA, 8 OCT 89 -- THE MEDELLIN CARTEL BOSSES HAVE PROPOSED TO THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT A "DEMOBILIZATION PLAN" THAT WOULD ENTAIL THE END OF DRUG TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES, THE SURRENDER OF WEAPONS, AND THE REPATRIATION OF CAPITAL IN EXCHANGE FOR A PARDON. THE PLAN WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED WITHIN 3 MONTHS AT THE LATEST, ACCORDING TO INFORMATION PUBLISHED TODAY ON THE ALREADY FAMOUS GOVERNMENT-MAFIA DIALOGUE BY LA PRENSA. THE OPPOSITION NEWSPAPER LA PRENSA, OF BOGOTA, YESTERDAY PUBLISHED A REPORT ACCORDING TO WHICH SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY GERMAN MONTOYA, ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT, HELD PEACE TALKS FOR A YEAR WITH SPOKESMEN FOR THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS. THE OFFICIAL HAS DENIED THIS REPORT AND DESCRIBED IT AS "HARMFUL AND SLANDEROUS." ACCORDING TO NEWSPAPER REPORTS, THE CARTEL BOSSES PRESENTED THE PLAN TO THE PRESIDENCY IN SEPTEMBER 1988 AND THE PRESIDENCY SHOULD HAVE WORKED ON IT "DIRECTLY AND SECRETLY." THE PROPOSAL, WHICH HAD THREE PHASES, WAS FORMULATED AFTER THE MAFIA BOSSES HAD DECIDED TO ACCEPT PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S PEACE PLAN "WITHOUT HESITATION." ACCORDING TO THE CARTEL PLAN, IN ADDITION TO GRANTING THE PARDON, THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO LIFT THE STATE OF SIEGE REGULATIONS TO FIGHT TERRORISM AND DRUG TRAFFICKING AND TO SECURE FROM THE UNITED STATES A JUDICIAL PARDON FOR COLOMBIANS WANTED BY U.S. FEDERAL COURTS. THIS LAST ASPECT WAS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE IN THE NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS "BECAUSE THE COLOMBIAN OFFICIALS DID NOT FIND A WAY TO DISCUSS THE MATTER WITH THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION, WHICH HAS DECIDED TO FIGHT THE PROBLEM MILITARILY," ACCORDING TO FORMER MINISTER JOAQUIN VALLEJO, WHO ACTED AS A SPOKESMAN FOR THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN THE TALKS WITH THE GOVERNMENT. ACCORDING TO VALLEJO, A TRIPARTITE DIALOGUE BETWEEN COLOMBIA AND THE UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ON THE NONEXTRADITION OF COLOMBIANS WAS AN ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT FOR MONTOYA TO GO AHEAD WITH THE PACIFICATION CONTACTS. THE FORMER MINISTER SAID: "THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT DECLARED WAR ON DRUG TRAFFICKERS BECAUSE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAD TAKEN THIS MEASURE FIRST." HE ADDED: "AFTER THE NUMEROUS MURDERS OF THE RECENT MONTHS, THE PRESIDENT THOUGHT IT IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP TALKING ." IN ACTIONS THAT OBSERVERS DESCRIBED AS "INEXPLICABLE," ASSASSINS PAID BY THE COCAINE CARTELS KILLED FIVE COLOMBIAN PERSONALITIES, INCLUDING PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LUIS CARLOS GALAN, BETWEEN 27 JUNE AND 18 AUGUST. MEANWHILE, THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO TODAY CONTINUED TO BE SEVERELY CRITICIZED AND ACCUSED OF HANDLING THE ANTIDRUG STRUGGLE WITH A "DOUBLE STANDARD" AND CONCEALING "MANY TRUTHS" RELATED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING. ALVARO LEYVA, PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL OF THE OPPOSITION SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE PARTY WHO SECURED THE DOCUMENTS THAT LA PRENSA PUBLISHED, POINTED OUT: "I WANT THE FULL TRUTH TO BE DISCLOSED BECAUSE THE FATE OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE IS AT STAKE." LEYVA FINALLY SAID: "I WANT TO KNOW ALL. IT IS A SAD THING DEAD MEN CANNOT SPEAK, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ALWAYS THOUGHT THE GOVERNMENT MEANT BUSINESS, AND WHO THOUGHT THAT IN THIS COUNTRY AUTHORITIES DO WHAT THEY SAY THEY WILL."
DEV-MUC3-0556	BOGOTA, 8 OCT 89 -- THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT , WHICH RECENTLY LAYED DOWN ITS WEAPONS TO REJOIN CIVILIAN LIFE AFTER ACCEPTING THE PEACE PROCESS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, BECAME A POLITICAL PARTY TODAY IN THE HOPE OF RULING THE COUNTRY. AT THE END OF THE M-19'S ANNUAL CONFERENCE HELD IN THE SOUTHWESTERN CITY OF POPAYAN, CAUCA PROVINCE, THE MOVEMENT WAS FORMALLY CONSTITUTED AS A POLITICAL ORGANIZATION WITH ITS LEADER, CARLOS PIZARO LEONGOMEZ, PROCLAIMED AS A PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL. THE M-19 GUERRILLA GROUP, FOUNDED IN THE EARLY 1970'S AND CONSIDERED ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST ACTIVE, BECAME RENOWNED WHEN IT OCCUPIED THE DOMINICAN EMBASSY IN BOGOTA AND HELD SEVERAL AMBASSADORS HOSTAGE AND WHEN IT LATER OCCUPIED THE PALACE OF JUSTICE, WHERE SEVERAL MAGISTRATES AND SUBVERSIVES WERE KILLED. THE M-19 ANNOUNCED THE COMPOSITION OF ITS DIRECTORATE, WHICH IS HEADED BY PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ AND INCLUDES SOME MEMBERS OF THE M-19'S POLITICAL LEADERSHIP, SUCH AS ANTONIO NAVARRO, GERMAN ROJAS, OTTI PATINO, AND LIBARDO PARRA. IT ALSO INCLUDES MARCO CHALITA, WHO WILL RUN FOR THE SENATE FOR THE SOUTHERN PROVINCE OF HUILA, AND VERA GREIFF, ROSEMBERG PABON, ANYAIR ARTUNDUAGA, AND HEBER BUSTAMANTE.

DEV-MUC3-0557	LIMA, 8 OCT 89 -- THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS ESTABLISHED UNPRECEDENTED SECURITY MEASURES TO GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT PRESIDENTS AND FOREIGN MINISTERS WHO WILL BEGIN MEETING ON 9 OCTOBER IN TRUJILLO, THE COUNTRY'S THIRD-LARGEST CITY, 570 KM NORTH OF LIMA. ACCORDING TO MEDIA REPORTS, SOME 15,000 OFFICERS, INCLUDING POLICE, ARMY, NAVY, AND AIR FORCE PERSONNEL, WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SECURITY AT TRUJILLO AND ICA, 300 KM SOUTH OF LIMA.

HOTEL WORKERS AND EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN REPLACED AS A PREVENTIVE MEASURE. THE PRESIDENTS OF PERU, COLOMBIA, AND BOLIVIA WILL ALSO BE MEETING IN ICA ON 10 OCTOBER TO ANALYZE THE PROBLEM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING, WHICH AFFECTS THEIR COUNTRIES ESPECIALLY. THIS MEETING WAS ORIGINALLY PLANNED FOR PARACAS, A TOWN NEAR ICA, BUT WAS MOVED TO ICA FOR SECURITY REASONS. THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE BEEN CONFINED TO BARRACKS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY SINCE LAST NIGHT BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO SOURCES, IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE SHINING PATH AND THE TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT WILL TRY TO STAGE VIOLENT ACTS DURING THE MEETINGS. THE GUARDS AROUND THE EMBASSIES OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN REINFORCED WITH POLICE DOGS TRAINED TO DETECT EXPLOSIVES. POLICE HAVE ALSO ARRESTED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN LIMA TO CHECK ON ANY POSSIBLE CONNECTIONS TO GUERRILLA MOVEMENTS OR TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ACCOUNTS TO SETTLE WITH THE COURTS. THE ROUNDUPS ARE ALSO BEING CARRIED OUT TO FIND LOCAL TELEVISION MAGNATE HECTOR DELGADO PARKER, WHO WAS APPARENTLY KIDNAPPED BY THE MRTA DURING AN INCIDENT IN WHICH DELGADO'S DRIVER WAS KILLED AND HIS BODYGUARD WOUNDED. THE KIDNAPPING WAS CARRIED OUT BY A GROUP OF PEOPLE, TWO OF WHOM WERE DRESSED IN POLICE UNIFORMS, IN THE STREETS OF LIMA ON 4 OCTOBER. NEWSPAPER SOURCES TODAY SAID THAT AN ALLEGED LIEUTENANT TO MRTA CHIEF VICTOR POLAY, WHO HAS BEEN IN PRISON SINCE DECEMBER 1988, HAS ALSO BEEN ARRESTED.
DEV-MUC3-0558	LIMA, 8 OCT 89 -- ACCORDING TO A CONFIDENTIAL PERUVIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE DOCUMENT PUBLISHED TODAY BY THE LIMA DAILY LA REPUBLICA, THE PERUVIAN SHINING PATH GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION IS PLANNING TO PROVOKE A FOOD SHORTAGE IN LIMA. ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, THIS ALLEGED SHINING PATH STRATEGY, BASED ON THE THEORY BY THE LEADER OF THE CHINESE REVOLUTION, MAO ZEDONG, "OF LAYING SIEGE TO THE CITY FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE," IS PART OF THE TERRORISTS' EFFORTS TO BOYCOTT THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS OF 12 NOVEMBER 1989 AND, SUBSEQUENTLY, THE GENERAL AND CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS OF APRIL 1990. ACCORDING TO PASSAGES FROM THE DOCUMENT PUBLISHED IN LA REPUBLICA, THE SHINING PATH "HAS REPORTEDLY GAINED CONTROL OVER AN IMPORTANT SECTOR OF LIMA'S FOOD SUPPLY AND MARKETING NETWORK." OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE POINTED OUT THAT FARMER IN THE VALLEYS OF THE PERUVIAN COAST AREA HAVE BEEN THREATENED BY "SHINING PATH PEOPLE" SO THAT THEY NEITHER HARVEST NOR SELL THEIR PRODUCTS. SIMILAR INTIMIDATING ACTIONS ARE ALSO EXPECTED IN THE SIERRA VALLEYS AND THE PERUVIAN JUNGLE AREA, THE SAME SOURCES NOTED. PERUVIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS ALSO EXPECT THE TERRORISTS TO TAKE DIRECT ACTION WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS BY BURNING THE TRUCKS THAT SUPPLY LIMA WITH FOODSTUFFS. THIS SABOTAGE, THE DOCUMENT POINTS OUT, "WOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY MASSIVE ACTIONS AGAINST THE ELECTRIC POWER SUPPLY SYSTEM AIMED AT REDUCING THE REFRIGERATED STORAGE CAPACITY OF LIMA'S MAIN FOOD SUPPLIERS." THE REPORTS POINTS OUT THAT THE BOYCOTT OF THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY A "SHINING PATH" CALL TO HOLD A "NATIONAL ARMED STOPPAGE" FOR 12 NOVEMBER 1989, WHICH WILL SERVE AS A TRIAL FOR SIMILAR ACTIONS IN THE APRIL 1990 GENERAL ELECTIONS. ELSEWHERE, A CAR BOMB EXPLODED LAST NIGHT IN THE TOWN OF BARRANCA, LIMA DEPARTMENT, CLOSE TO WHERE FORMER EDUCATION MINISTER GROVER PANGO IS STAYING. FOUR PEOPLE WERE INJURED AND PROPERTY WAS DAMAGED. TERRORIST GROUPS ALSO BLEW UP SEVERAL HIGH-VOLTAGE TOWERS. A BLACKOUT WAS REPORTED IN BARRANCA AND NEIGHBORING TOWNS. ACCORDING TO A REPORT PUBLISHED BY LA REPUBLICA, THE TERRORIST ESCALATION BEGAN LAST FRIDAY IN LIMA AND TWO POLICEMEN DIED IN THE TOWN OF CERRO BLANCO. IN HUANCAYO, THE CAPITAL OF JUNIN DEPARTMENT IN THE PERUVIAN CENTRAL SIERRA, THE SANTA ISABEL HIGH SCHOOL HAS BEEN THE TARGET OF 10 BOMB ATTACKS OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS. THE ATTACKS HAVE APPARENTLY BEEN PERPETRATED BY TERRORISTS WHO HAVE INFILTRATED THEMSELVES INTO THE 5,000 SANTA ISABEL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. ONLY PROPERTY DAMAGE HAS BEEN REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THE ATTACKS.
DEV-MUC3-0559	TRUJILLO, 9 OCT 89 -- TODAY IN THE CITY OF TRUJILLO THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, MEXICO, AND PERU BEGAN DISCUSSING THE POSSIBILITY OF OUSTING PANAMA FROM THE GROUP OF EIGHT AND EVENTUALLY ACCEPTING ECUADOR IN ITS PLACE. THE POSSIBILITY OF EXPELLING PANAMA FROM THE GROUP WAS DISCUSSED EVEN THOUGH ARGENTINE FOREIGN MINISTER DOMINGO CAVALLO SAID THE ISSUE WAS NOT ON THE AGENDA. ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE OUSTING OF PANAMA FROM THE GROUP OF EIGHT AND REPLACING IT WITH ECUADOR, ARGENTINE FOREIGN MINISTER DOMINGO CAVALLO TOLD EFE: "WE ARE GOING TO LISTEN TO THE PROPOSAL, BUT WE PREFER NOT TO COMMENT FOR THE TIME BEING. WE WILL SEE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE MEETING WHAT THE BASIS FOR THAT PROPOSAL IS." CAVALLO ADDED: "WE DO NOT HAVE PROPOSALS OR INITIATIVES ANY DIFFERENT FROM THE ISSUES TO BE DISCUSSED ON PANAMA." MEXICAN FOREIGN MINISTER FERNANDO SOLANA TOLD EFE THAT THE PREPARATORY FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETING WILL DISCUSS THE PANAMANIAN ISSUE AND THAT MEXICO WILL DECIDE ITS STANCE "AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME." BRAZILIAN FOREIGN MINISTER ROBERTO DE ABREU SAID IN THIS CITY YESTERDAY THAT BRAZIL HAS AN INDIVIDUAL POSITION "BUT WILL ACCEPT AND SUPPORT A JOINT AGREEMENT." PERUVIAN FOREIGN MINISTER GUILLERMO LARCO COX ALSO SAID YESTERDAY THAT PERU WILL PROPOSE "THE FINAL SEPARATION OF PANAMA" FROM THE GROUP OF EIGHT. LARCO ADDED THAT PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA WILL PROPOSE THE SEPARATION OF PANAMA FROM THE GROUP DURING THE SUMMIT MEETING THAT WILL BE HELD WITH THE PRESIDENTS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, COLOMBIA, MEXICO, URUGUAY, AND VENEZUELA ON 11 AND 12 OCTOBER. THE MEETING WILL TAKE PLACE IN ICA, 850 KM SOUTH OF TRUJILLO. TODAY LARCO COX OPENED THE GROUP OF EIGHT FOREIGN MINISTERS' MEETING IN TRUJILLO. THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF COLOMBIA AND VENEZUELA WERE ABSENT BECAUSE THEY WILL GO DIRECTLY TO ICA WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE PRESIDENTS. IN A BRIEF SPEECH, LARCO COX CALLED ON THE OTHER REPRESENTATIVES TO STRUGGLE FOR THE UNITY, INTEGRATION, AND INDEPENDENCE IN THE REGION. COX ADDED: "WE MUST WORK FOR OVERALL DEVELOPMENT. WE PROPOSE AS AN ACT OF JUSTICE THE INTEGRATION OF THE CONTINENT WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PEOPLE." HE ADDED THAT THE INTEGRATION PROCESS CANNOT BE AN ISOLATED PROCESS AND THAT UNITY CAN ONLY BE EFFECTIVE IF THE COUNTRIES RESCUE THE HISTORIC VALUES WHICH CONSOLIDATED THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE AMERICAS. THE MINISTERS ALSO DISCUSSED, IN ADDITION TO THE PANAMANIAN AND ECUADORAN CASE, THE DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM, JOINT ACTION TO DEAL WITH THE REGION'S FOREIGN DEBT, ESTIMATED AT $420 BILLION, AND TERRORISM. THE PROPOSALS MADE IN TRUJILLO WILL BE DISCUSSED BY THE SEVEN PRESIDENTS IN ICA. THE FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETING IS BEING HELD UNDER POLICE AND MILITARY CONTROL TO PREVENT TERRORIST ATTACKS. ON 4 OCTOBER A CAR BOMB EXPLODED ABOUT 500 METERS FROM THE MEETING SITE. FORTUNATELY, THERE WAS ONLY PROPERTY DAMAGE. SOME OF THE SECURITY MEASURES INCLUDED THE CHANGE OF THE FOREIGN MINISTERS' ARRIVAL TIMES AND SOME CHANGES IN THE OFFICIAL PROGRAM. THERE IS STRICT POLICE CONTROL NEAR THE CESAR VALLEJO CIVIC CENTER WHERE THE MINISTERS ARE MEETING. VEHICLE AND PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC WAS PROHIBITED WITHIN ABOUT 200 METERS OF THE CENTER. THE FIRST MEETING OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT WAS HELD IN ACAPULCO, MEXICO, IN 1987, AND THE SECOND MEETING WAS HELD IN PUNTA DEL ESTE, URUGUAY, IN 1988.
DEV-MUC3-0560	BOGOTA, 10 OCT 89 -- MARTA LUZ LOPEZ, MANAGER OF EL ESPECTADOR IN MEDELLIN, WAS KILLED BY MOTORCYCLE-RIDING GUNMEN AT NOON TODAY. HER MOTHER, MARTA OROZCO LOPEZ, WAS WOUNDED IN THE ATTACK AND IS NOW BEING TREATED AT THE SOMA CLINIC IN THAT CITY.
DEV-MUC3-0561	GUATEMALA CITY, 10 OCT 89 -- GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO TODAY ANNOUNCED THE APPOINTMENT OF ARIEL RIVERA IRIAS AS THE NEW FOREIGN MINISTER TO REPLACE MARIO PALENCIA. CEREZO ALSO APPOINTED NEW GOVERNMENT AND FINANCE MINISTERS, GENERAL CARLOS AUGUSTO MORALES AND FRANCISCO PINTO CASAROLA, RESPECTIVELY, TO REPLACE ROBERTO VALLE AND RODOLFO PAIZ. MEANWHILE, GONZALO MENENDEZ DE LA RIVA, GUATEMALA'S HUMAN RIGHTS ATTORNEY GENERAL, TODAY PRESENTED HIS IRREVOCABLE RESIGNATION TO THE POST THAT HE HAD HELD SINCE 1987. MENENDEZ, WHO IS 82-YEARS-OLD, EXPLAINED THAT HE WAS RESIGNING BECAUSE, "I FEEL TIRED DUE TO MY ADVANCED AGE," AND ADDED THAT THIS WAS FOR "ABSOLUTELY PERSONAL" REASONS. AT THE GOVERNMENT PALACE THE PRESIDENT EXPLAINED THAT THE CHANGES ARE PART OF A PROJECT AND ORGANIZATION OF HIS 500-DAY ADMINISTRATION PROGRAM. VINICIO CEREZO ALSO ANNOUNCED THE APPOINTMENT OF HUMBERTO LAU AS PRESIDENT OF THE METROPOLITAN URBAN AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL. THIS POSITION HAD BEEN VACANT SINCE 1 AUGUST WHEN DANILO VARILLAS, CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC LEADER AND FORMER GUATEMALAN AMBASSADOR TO SPAIN, WAS SHOT TO DEATH. ROBERTO VALLE, WHO WILL RETURN TO CONGRESS AS A DEPUTY, WAS CRITICIZED BY POLITICAL LEADERS AND SOCIAL SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION FOR HIS INABILITY TO CURB VIOLENCE. THE PRESIDENT POINTED OUT THAT PAIZ MIGHT BECOME A VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN NEXT YEAR'S GENERAL ELECTIONS.
DEV-MUC3-0562	HAVANA , 10 OCT 89 -- GREETINGS COMRADE. GUATEMALA ALWAYS COMES UP IN CENTRAL AMERICAN NEWS. WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT GUATEMALA. INTERNATIONAL NEWS AGENCIES BLOCK REPORTS FROM GUATEMALA . WE HAVE LEARNED THAT IN ADDITION TO THE ATMOSPHERE OF CHAOS AND INSTABILITY, REPRESSION HAS INCREASED IN THE LAST 7 MONTHS. IT WAS REPORTED RECENTLY THAT 2,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED, 2,500 WOUNDED -- MANY OF THEM CRIPPLED -- AND HUNDREDS -- OVER 800 ARE MISSING. WE HAVE TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY OF A VISIT PAID BY MR RODRIGO ASTURIAS, WHO IS MEMBER OF THE URNG MILITARY DIRECTORATE AND IS ALSO KNOWN AS COMMANDER GASPAR, NOT ONLY IN GUATEMALA AND CENTRAL AMERICA BUT THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, TO TALK AND CLEAR SOME MATTERS PERTAINING TO GUATEMALA. COMMANDER GASPAR: SOME STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO FIND A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION. THAT IS, STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GUERRILLA AND THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT. SOME JOURNALISTS AND SPECIALISTS WONDER IF THE SEARCH FOR A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE SITUATION PREVAILING IN GUATEMALA. WHAT COULD YOU TELL US ABOUT THIS? I BELIEVE THIS IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION THAT NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED. AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER, THE URNG GENERAL COMMAND MADE A NEW PROPOSAL AIMED AT FINDING A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICT OUR COUNTRY IS EXPERIENCING. THE PROPOSAL TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION AND TO ESTABLISH A DIALOGUE AS A FIRST STEP TO CREATE THE CONDITIONS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT ENTAILS AN INCREASED EFFORT IN THE STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY. WE DO NOT THINK OF DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION AS A DEMOBILIZATION ELEMENT BUT AS AN EXTREMELY ACTIVE ELEMENT, AS A CLARIFYING ELEMENT, TO FIND AND PUT IN PLACE CONSENSUS WITH DEMOCRATIC SOLUTIONS. THIS IS WHY ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN, IN FACT, AN INCREASE OF REPRESSION -- WHICH BY THE WAY, IT WAS BRUTALLY INTENSIFIED LAST MONTH -- THE PROPOSAL TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION AND THE CALL ALL NATIONAL SECTORS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, TO BEGIN CONTACTS, TALKS, AND DIALOGUE WITH THE UNRG DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO REFUSE THEM AND CONTINUES MAINTAINING A CLOSED POSITION. IT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THE DEMOCRATIC STRUGGLE. COMMANDER GASPAR, INSISTING IN THE LAST PART OF YOUR RESPONSE, WHAT ARE THE BASIS IN WHICH THIS TYPE OF TALKS AND DIALOGUE COULD BE INITIATED? SINCE OCTOBER 1987, WHEN ITS FIRST DIALOGUE INITIATIVE WAS ESTABLISHED, THE GENERAL COMMAND HAS SAID PREESTABLISHED CONDITIONS ARE NOT NECESSARY BUT THAT THE COUNTRY'S FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE DIALOGUE AND THE PREPARATION OF THE AGENDA. THE MAIN PROBLEM THE COUNTRY HAS AND HAS HAD IN THE LAST FEW YEARS IS THE LACK OF RESPECT TOWARD HUMAN RIGHTS, THE MILITARIZATION OF THE GUATEMALAN SOCIETY, AND THE GENERALIZED OPPRESSION EXPERIENCED. THEREFORE, WE BELIEVE THE MAIN POINT THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE AGENDA IS THE DEMOCRATIZATION. SPEAKING OF THE INTERNAL SITUATION FROM THE MILITARY POINT OF VIEW, NEWS AGENCY REPORT EVERY DAY OF MISSING PERSONS, KILLINGS, AND TORTURES. ARE THE ONES EVERYONE KNOWS AS THE DEATH SQUADRONS INCREASING THEIR ACTIVITIES? INDEED, THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN REPRESSION. WE COULD SAY WITHOUT BEING MISTAKEN THAT THERE IS A TERRORIST ESCALATION HEADED BY STATE SECURITY FORCES. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO DENOUNCE AND TO BE CLEAR ON THIS BECAUSE THE ONES THAT ARE CARRYING OUT THIS REPRESSION AND THE ONES THAT ARE TAKING FORWARD THIS TERROR CAMPAIGN ARE NOT PARAMILITARY GROUPS AS THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE AND THEY ARE NOT EXTREME-RIGHT CIVILIAN GROUPS. THEY ARE ARMY OPERATIVE GROUPS THAT ACT BASED ON INFORMATION, CHARGES, SUSPICIONS, OR MANY TIMES BLINDLY TO SEE WHAT INFORMATION THEY CAN FIND, IN WHAT WAY THEY CAN HIT OR INFILTRATE THE PEOPLE'S AND REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT. WE ARE FACED WITH AN ESCALATION OF THE STRONGEST STATE TERRORISM. IT CANNOT BE CONFUSED WITH DEATH SQUADRONS OR DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE RIGHT WING. THE ARMY IS THE ONE RESPONSIBLE OF THE REPRESSION.
DEV-MUC3-0563	SAN SALVADOR, 9 OCT -- SEVERAL ARMED CLASHES WITHIN NATIONAL TERRITORY ON 8 OCTOBER RESULTED IN AT LEAST 8 KILLED AND MORE THAN 20 INJURED, INCLUDING GUERILLAS AND SOLDIERS, A GOVERNMENT REPORT SAID TODAY. THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE SAID THAT AT LEAST FOUR SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AND EIGHT WERE WOUNDED WHEN THE REBELS AMBUSHED A MILITARY TRUCK NEAR SAN VICENTE, 60 KM EAST OF SAN SALVADOR. IN ADDITION, TWO FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT REBELS WERE KILLED IN HEAVY FIGHTING IN CIUDAD BARRIOS, SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT, THE REPORT ADDED. TWO MORE REBELS WERE KILLED AND AN UNSPECIFIED NUMBER OF GUERRILLAS AND SOLDIERS WERE WOUNDED IN ARMED ACTIONS IN THE COUNTRY'S EAST, THE REPORT ALSO SAID. FINALLY, A STORE WAS PARTIALLY DESTROYED IN SAN SALVADOR ON THE NIGHT OF 8 OCTOBER WHEN A POWERFUL BOMB ALLEGEDLY PLANTED BY URBAN GUERRILLAS EXPLODED. THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES.
DEV-MUC3-0564	BOGOTA, 11 OCT 89 -- JOSE RAFAEL ABELLO SILVA, CHIEF OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKING CARTEL ON THE COAST AND FOURTH MAN IN THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, WAS ARRESTED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY, DAS, IN NORTHERN BOGOTA DURING THE LAST FEW HOURS. ABELLO IS WANTED BY A U.S. FEDERAL COURT IN OKLAHOMA, THE UNITED STATES, FOR CONSPIRACY TO DISTRIBUTE DRUGS. ACTIVE IN THE MARIJUANA BUSINESS DURING THE LAST DECADE AND IS NOW RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE COCAINE WHICH THE MEDELLIN CARTEL SENDS TO THE UNITED STATES. AVELLO, 34, NATIVE OF SANTA MARTA, HAD BEEN ARRESTED IN EARLY 1988 FOR ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF WEAPONS ON THE ATLANTIC COAST. SHORTLY AFTER LUIS CARLOS GALAN'S ASSASSINATION, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ASKED FOR HIS EXTRADITION, BEARING IN MIND THAT THE FEDERAL COURT IN OKLAHOMA IS TRYING HIM FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING. HIS EXTRADITION IS TAKEN FOR GRANTYED, AND IT IS BELIEVED THAT IT WILL TAKE PLACE ONCE ALL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS ARE MET, WHICH WILL NOT BE BEFORE 1 WEEK. DAS SOURCES SAID THAT MONO AVELLO OFFERED 100 MILLION PESOS TO THE SIX DETECTIVES WHO ARRESTED HIM LAST NIGHT AT AN EXCLUSIVE RESTAURANT IN BOGOTA'S NORTHERN SECTION. THE AUTHORITIES HAD BEEN TRAILING HIM IN BOGOTA FOR SEVERAL DAYS. THE ARMY HAS OCCUPIED SEVERAL OF HIS PROPERTIES ON THE ATLANTIC COAST AND HAS SEIZED VEHICLES AND YACHTS BELONGING TO HIM. IN ANOTHER DEVELOPMENT, IT HAS BEEN LEARNED THAT PERUVIAN JUSTICE YESTERDAY INSISTED AGAIN ON THE EXTRADITION OF EVARISTO PORRAS ARDILA, WHO ESCAPED FROM A JAIL IN PERU WHILE SERVING A SENTENCE FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING.
DEV-MUC3-0565	SAN SALVADOR, 10 OCT 89 -- SEVERAL SALVADORAN SECTORS HAVE CONDEMNED THE MURDER OF THE WIFE OF THE DEPUTY EDITOR OF EL DIARIO DE HOY. SHE WAS RIDDLED WITH BULLETS NEAR THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY THIS MORNING. SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS DESCRIBED THE ACTION AS TERRORIST. HE SAID THIS IS A FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, WHICH WILL SURELY ALSO BE CONDEMNED BY THE UN HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, PASTOR RIBREJO, WHO IS IN THE COUNTRY. THE LAST STRAW IS THAT TERRORISTS, WITHOUT ANY RISK TO THEMSELVES, KILL DEFENSELESS WOMEN. THIS PARTICULAR LADY WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HER CHILDREN, ONE OF WHOM WAS WOUNDED. WE THINK THIS IS THE LIMIT. WE ARE NOT SURE WHO DID IT, BUT, CONSIDERING THE NATURE OF THE ACTION, IT APPEARS TO BE A TERRORIST CRIME. WE ALREADY KNOW WHO PERPETRATES SUCH ACTIONS. WE THINK THIS IS PART OF WHAT THE FMLN HAS BEEN DOING. THEY HAVE BEEN SILENCING VOICES THAT UPHOLD PHILOSOPHIES THAT RUN CONTRARY TO THEIR'S. REFERRING TO THE PRESENCE OF PASTOR RIBREJO IN THE COUNTRY, CRISTIANI SAID THE UN OFFICIAL WILL BE ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT THE POLICY OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES DOES NOT FIT THE VIOLATION OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS. I WILL NOT REFER TO MONSIGNOR ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS ALONE, BUT TO ALL OF THE ORGANIZATIONS LINKED TO THE FMLN THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DISCREDIT THE GOVERNMENT. I THINK DR RIBREJO WILL BE ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT NEITHER THE GOVERNMENT NOR THE ARMED FORCES ARE IN THE HABIT OF VIOLATING HUMAN RIGHTS. I THINK IF ONE TRIES TO BE OBJECTIVE AND REALISTIC, HE WILL REALIZE THAT THE FMLN HAS BEEN TRYING TO MAKE THE HOMELAND FALL INTO A STATE OF TOTAL ANARCHY. I THINK THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ACTED VERY PROFESSIONALLY. THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY HAS BEEN TO TRY TO SEEK SOLUTIONS THROUGH REASON RATHER THAN VIOLENCE. THESE EVENTS MUST BE SEEN IN THE LIGHT OF WHAT THE FMLN SAID IT WOULD DO. IT SAID IT WOULD UNLEASH EVEN GREATER VIOLENCE. AS FOR THE UPCOMING DIALOGUE MEETING TO BE HELD IN SAN JOSE ON 16 AND 17 OCTOBER, CRISTIANI SAID A COMMISSION IS READY TO RESUME TALKS WITH THE FMLN, TO WHICH A CEASE-FIRE WILL BE PROPOSED, AMONG OTHER THINGS. CRISTIANI SAID THAT THE COSTA RICAN GOVERNMENT HAS REPORTED WORKING ON THE LOGISTICS OF THE MEETING SO THE TALKS CAN BE HELD IN PEACE.
DEV-MUC3-0566	BUENOS AIRES, 8 OCT 89 -- THROUGH DECREE NO. 1003 THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS PARDONED SEVERAL TERRORISTS FROM DIFFERENT ARMED ORGANIZATIONS AND SOME MEMBERS OF URUGUAY'S MILITARY AND POLICE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE REPRESSION OF TERRORISM IN ARGENTINA.

DEV-MUC3-0567	SANTIAGO, 10 OCT 89 -- LUIS CORVALAN LEPE, THE LEADER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE WHO TODAY RETURNED TO CHILE AFTER 13 YEARS OF EXILE IN THE USSR, HAS EXPRESSED HIS SUPPORT FOR OPPOSITION PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, PATRICIO AYLWIN. ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE "MANUEL RODRIGUEZ NATIONAL LIBERATION PATRIOTIC FRONT " , WHICH IS IDENTIFIED AS THE ARMED BRANCH OF THE PCCH, CORVALAN SAID THAT "FOR ETHICAL AND MORAL REASONS, I CANNOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THOSE WHO HAVE STRUGGLED AGAINST THE DICTATORSHIP." IN 1986, THE FMLN TRIED TO KILL GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET AND ILLEGALLY INTRODUCED A LARGE ARMS CACHE INTO THE COUNTRY. ITS LEADERS ARE CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING A "PATRIOTIC WAR." THEY HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO PROMOTE AN ARMED STRUGGLE IF AYLWIN IS ELECTED. ADDRESSING JOURNALISTS AT THE SANTIAGO AIRPORT, CORVALAN SAID: "VIOLENCE IS A SOCIAL FACTOR WHICH UNFORTUNATELY SOCIETY HAS BEEN UNABLE TO OVERCOME." ASKED WHETHER HIS JUSTIFICATION OF VIOLENCE MAY HINDER AYLWIN'S CANDIDACY, THE 73-YEAR OLD PCCH LEADER SAID HE DOES NOT BELEIVE THIS WILL HAPPEN BECAUSE "AYLWIN'S CANDIDACY REPRESENTS THE EXPRESSION OF ALL DEMOCRATIC TRENDS." CORVALAN ADDED: "AYLWIN IS A CONSENSUS CANDIDATE. HE IS THE CANDIDATE WHO SHOULD OBTAIN THE LARGEST SUPPORT UNDER THE CURRENT CONDITIONS IN CHILE ON THE BASIS OF RESPECT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL POSITION OF EACH POLITICAL TREND." ABOUT THE CONTINUATION OF PINOCHET AS THE CHILEAN ARMY COMMANDER AFTER THE ASSUMPTION OF THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT, CORVALAN SAID: "IT IS NOT PROPER FOR ONE PERSON TO GIVE ORDERS TO ANOTHER WHO WAS ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE." CORVALAN SAID THAT THE OLD DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PCCH AND THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAVE BEEN OVERCOME BECAUSE "ALL OF US HAVE CHANGED OVER THE YARS." HE ADDED THAT THE PCCH MEMBERS "ARE NOT THE SAME AS THEY WERE IN 1973. WE ARE IMMERSED IN PERESTROIKA, AND THERE HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLE CHANGES." HE ADDED: "THE PDC HAS ALSO EXPERIENCED CHANGES SINCE 1973."
DEV-MUC3-0568	BUENOS AIRES, 10 OCT 89 -- ARGENTINE FOREIGN MINISTER DOMINGO CAVALLO AND HIS PERUVIAN COUNTERPART GUILLERMO LARCO COX SIGNED THREE INTEGRATION AGREEMENTS TODAY IN TRUJILLO, LIBERTAD DEPARTMENT. CAVALLO SAID THAT THE AGREEMENTS "CLEARLY SHOW THE EFFORTS BEING MADE TOWARD COMMON GOAL" WHICH MEANS "MOVING AHEAD TO BUILD A GREAT LATIN AMERICAN NATION." THE AGREEMENTS, WHICH WERE PREPARED BY THE FOREIGN MINISTRIES OF THE TWO COUNTRIES, WERE SIGNED TODAY BY THE TWO FOREIGN MINISTERS IN THE OLD HOUSE THAT BELONGED TO SIMON BOLIVIAR DURING THE TIME HE LIVED IN TRUJILLO. THE CEREMONY WAS HELD UNDER STRICT SECURITY MEASURES, SEEKING TO PREVENT SUBVERSIVE ACTIONS. SECURITY MEASURES WERE REINFORCED IN THE LAST FEW HOURS FOLLOWING AN ATTACK EARLY THIS MORNING 12 BLOCS FROM THE HOTEL WHERE THE DELEGATIONS ARE STAYING. THE FIRST AGREEMENT CREATES THE POLITICAL COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION COMMITTEE. CAVALLO SAID THAT THIS IS AIMED AT "TAKING MORE ORDERLY STEPS IN THE EFFORTS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY BECAUSE THE ARGENTINE AND PERUVIAN DESIRE FOR INTEGRATION HAS ROOTS AS OLD AS THE STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE." THE SECOND AGREEMENT REFERS TO THE COORDINATION OF EFFORTS FOR THE PREVENTION AND REPRESSION OF DRUG TRAFFICKING. CAVALLO SAID: "THIS PROBLEM IS REACHING TERRIFYING DIMENSIONS BECAUSE ITS ECONOMIC POWER IS MIXED WITH TERRORIST AND SUBVERSIVE GROUPS. AS SUCH IT IS BECOMING A GROWING THREAT TO THE LATIN AMERICAN DEMOCRACIES." IN A BRIEF SPEECH CAVALLO ALSO REFERRED TO THE THIRD AGREEMENT TO PREVENT DOUBLE TAXATION AMONG AIR AND MARITIME ENTERPRISES. HE SAID: "INTEGRATION REQUIRES GOOD TRANSPORTATION METHODS WITH WHICH TO BRING PEOPLE CLOSER TOGETHER" THUS MAKING "PROGRESS THROUGH CONCRETE MECHANISMS IN THE INTEGRATION PROCESS IN WHICH OUR COUNTRIES ARE INVOLVED." LARCO COX SAID THAT THROUGH THESE AGREEMENTS "ARGENTINE PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM HAS CONFIRMED, THROUGH HIS REPRESENTATIVE, HIS POLITICAL WILL TO AGREE" TO FIND SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS AFFECTING THE REGION BY SEEKING "NEW ROADS FOR UNDERSTANDING AND TO STRENGTHEN OUR ALREADY RICH BILATERAL RELATIONS." A FEW HOURS BEFORE THIS CEREMONY, WHICH WAS ALSO ATTENDED BY UNDER SECRETARY JOSE LUIS FERNANDEZ VALONI AND AMBASSADOR JULIAN LICASTRO, TRUJILLO WAS SHAKEN AT 0400 BY FOUR POWERFUL DYNAMITE EXPLOTIONS WHICH DESTROYED ABOUT HALF DOZEN OFFICES OF THE NATIONAL HOUSING ENTERPRISE. THIS ENTERPRISE, WHICH OPERATES WITH STATE AND PRIVATE CAPITAL, IS LOCATED IN THE MONSERRATE DISTRICT WHERE THERE IS A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT FOR POOR PEOPLE. IT IS LOCATED 1 KM FROM THE PARADE GROUND, DOWNTOWN TRUJILLO, ACROSS FROM WHICH IS LOCATED THE TURISTA HOTEL. THIS IS THE HOTEL WHERE THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF ARGENTINA, PERU, COLOMBIA, URUGUAY, BRAZIL, MEXICO AND VENEZUELA ARE STAYING. THE EXPLOSIONS DID NOT CAUSE ANY CASUALTIES AND THE POLICE HOLD THE TUPAC AMARY REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACK.
DEV-MUC3-0569	LIMA, NO DATE -- SECOND, MY ADMINISTRATION HAS ADOPTED MEASURES TO CONFRONT ORGANIZED TERRORISM WHICH IS CONDUCTED BY DRUG CARTELS OR GANGS OF CRIMINALS, TRAINED BY FOREIGN MERCENARIES AND FINANCED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS. THEY HAVE MURDERED JUDGES, A MINISTER OF JUSTICE, A ... ... IN A LETTER DATED OCTOBER 9 TO UN SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR AND THE RESPECTIVE AMBASSADORS. THIS SPECIAL ASSEMBLY DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SHOULD EXCLUDE WORLD SECURITY ISSUES. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ... WORLD DEVELOPMENT AND POLITICAL POWER. TO THIS WE MUST ALSO ADD THE UNIFICATION OF THE EUROPE IN 1992. BESIDES, THE SOVIET POLICIES OF PERESTROYKA AND GLASNOST HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY MODIFIED NOT ONLY THE COMMUNIST IDEAS BUT ALSO THE FUTURE WORLD POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SCENE. THESE TRANSFORMATIONS ARE ATTRACTIVE FOR THE INDUSTRIALIZED EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THEY PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF EASTERN EUROPE AND PROBABLY REDUCE EUROPEAN INTEREST IN LATIN AMERICA. BESIDES, THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA ARE PERMANENTLY MAKING PROGRESS TOWARD THEIR SOCIOECONOMIC INTEGRATION. WE STAND BEFORE A DIFFERENT WORLD WHICH IS OFFERING OPPORTUNITIES WHICH MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT, BUT WHICH ALSO CREATES DIFFICULTIES FOR WHICH WE MUST BE PREPARED. LATIN AMERICA SHOULD RECONSIDER ITS SITUATION AND POLICIES IN FACE OF THE RAPID WORLD CHANGES. WE MUST ANALYZE THE WAY IN WHICH WE WILL INTEGRATE AND HARMONIZE OUR ECONOMIES IN THIS NEW INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SCENE. IN FACE OF THESE EVENTS, WE MUST REDEFINE OUR INTEGRATION FORMULAS AND OUR DEVELOPMENT MODELS. I SUGGEST THAT A WORK GROUP BE FORMED TO STUDY THIS SUBJECT AND TO ADOPT SPECIFIC MEASURES LEADING TO THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRESS OF LATIN AMERICA IN THIS NEW WORLD THAT IS BEING BORN. MY DEAR PRESIDENTS AND FRIENDS, THIS NEW MEETING OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT MUST MAKE US STRENGTHEN OUR SOLIDARITY IN FACE OF THE THREATS AGAINST DEMOCRACY AND OUR SOCIAL PROGRESS. WE MUST STRENGTHEN THE REGIONAL COOPERATION MECHANISM AND OUR NEGOTIATED CAPACITY THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN EFFICIENT STRATEGY OF CONSENSUS TO MAKE OUR PROPOSALS MORE SOLID. WE MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT ARE UNITED BY UNDENIABLE HISTORIC TIES OF FRIENDSHIP. WE ARE ALSO UNITED BY STRATEGIC, POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS WHICH MUST BE COORDINATED TO BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY FACE THE CHALLENGES OF TOMORROW. AS I RECENTLY TOLD MY VENEZUELAN COUNTERPART, UNITY CAN BE SOLIDLY BUILT ON FEASIBLE INITIATIVES RATHER THAN ON WORDS. INTEGRATION THRIVES ON ACHIEVEMENT THAT IN PRACTICE BRING PEOPLES TOGETHER AND ALLOW THEM TO ENJOY THE RESULTS OF PROGRESS OBTAINED THROUGH COMMON EFFORT. YEARS OF STRUGGLE FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT HAVE SHOWN US THAT DEVELOPMENT MUST BE BASED ON ACTIONS THAT WILL GENERATE CONFIDENCE AND WELL-BEING, CONTRIBUTE TO NATURALLY COMPLEMENTARY ACTIONS, AND SOLVE SMALL AND LARGE PROBLEMS. COLOMBIA IS DETERMINED TO CONTINUE STRENGTHENING THE MECHANISM OF CONSENSUS BY ENDORSING THE SUGGESTIONS I HAVE MADE AND THOSE THAT WILL SPRING FROM THIS SUMMIT MEETING. THANK YOU.
DEV-MUC3-0570	SAN SALVADOR, 12 OCT 89 -- APPROXIMATELY 1,600 SALVADORANS HAVE VOICED THEIR DETERMINATION TO RETURN TO EL SALVADOR ON 17 OCTOBER, WITHOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S APPROVAL, AFTER HAVING REMAINED AS REFUGEES IN A HONDURAN CAMP SINCE THE EARLY 80'S. "WE INSIST ON RETURNING TO EL SALVADOR ON 17 OCTOBER. HERE, WE ARE BEING IMPRISONED FOR NO REASON. WE ARE LEAVING BECAUSE OTHERWISE, WE WILL BE KILLED. WE ARE SALVADORANS, AND THAT IS WHY WE WANT TO RETURN TO OUR COUNTRY," SAID ONE OF THE REFUGEES IN A TELEVISION INTERVIEW. INTERIOR MINISTER FRANCISCO MERINO WARNED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ALLOW THE ENTRY OF REFUGEES WHO DO NOT HAVE IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENTS ISSUED BY THE UN HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES . "IF THEY ARRIVE ABRUPTLY AT THE SALVADORAN BORDER, WITHOUT THE DOCUMENTS THAT CERTIFY THEY ARE SALVADORANS, THEY CANNONT ENTER THE COUNTRY," MERINO POINTED OUT. ACCORDING TO MERINO, WHO IS ALSO THE SALVADORAN VICE PRESIDENT, THE REFUGEES' DETERMINATION TO RETURN WITHOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S APPROVAL IS "EVIDENCE" OF THEIR RELATIONS WITH THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS. HOWEVER, THE REFUGEES -- INCLUDING WOMEN, THE ELDERLY, AND CHILDREN -- DENIED ANY LINKS WITH THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GUERRILLAS. MERINO INTERPRETED THE REFUGEES' WISHES TO REPATRIATE IN A MASSIVE AND IMMEDIATE MANNER AS "PLANS TO PROVOKE PROBLEMS THAT WILL AFFECT THE IMAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT WITH REGARD TO THE ISSUE OF RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS." ON 10 OCTOBER, AN OFFICIAL COMMISSION, HEADED BY DEPUTY INTERIOR MINISTER COLONEL CARLOS FIGUEROA VISITED THE HONDURAN CAMP AT MESA GRANDE TO TRY TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE REFUGEES SO THEY COULD PREPARE FOR THEIR REPATRIATION IN 1990 AND AGREE ON THE PLACES WHERE THEY WOULD BE RELOCATED. THE NATIONAL COMMISSION WAS UNABLE TO REACH ANY AGREEMENT FOR POSTPONING THE REPATRIATION OF THE SALVADORANS TO 1990. THE MILITARY OFFICER DISCLOSED THAT THERE ARE LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS IN PREPARING FOR THE 17 OCTOBER REPATRIATION. "THE UNHCR IS NOT PREPARED TO GIVE LOGISTICAL SUPPORT TO THE SALVADORANS WHO WANT TO RETURN NEXT WEEK AND IT NEEDS FOR BOTH PARTIES THE GOVERNMENT AND THE REFUGEES) TO REACH AN AGREEMENT IN ORDER TO GO AHEAD WITH THE REPATRIATION," COL FIGUEROA ADDED. ONE OF THE REFUGEES, WHO PREFERRED NOT TO BE IDENTIFIED, CHARGED THAT UNHCR "HAS BEEN UNABLE TO GIVE US TRANSPORTATION AND THE HONDURAN ARMY IS NOT ALLOWING FOOD AND MEDICINE TO REACH US. IN ADDITION, WE ARE THE TARGET OF HONDURAN MILITARY ATTACKS." IN MESA GRANDE, THERE ARE 3,718 SALVADORANS, OF WHICH 900 ARE CHILDREN. THESE REFUGEES LEFT EL SALVADOR EARLY IN 1980 WHEN THE WAR WHICH HAS LEFT OVER 70,000 DEAD BROKE OUT. THERE ARE ALSO AN ADDITIONAL 13,000 SALVADORANS IN MESA GRANDE WHO WANT TO BE REPATRIATED, SAYS THE NATIONAL COORDINATING BOARD ON REFUGEES, THAT CLAIMS TO REPRESENT THEM. THE REFUGEES ARE DEMANDING THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT COMPLY WITH THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE AGREEMENTS THAT WERE SIGNED 2 YEARS AGO IN GUATEMALA, WHICH -- ACCORDING TO THEM -- WOULD ALLOW THEM TO RETURN TO THE COUNTRY WITH GUARANTEES.
DEV-MUC3-0571	LIMA, 12 OCT 89 -- WHAT IS THE POSITION OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT REGARDING THE MALVINAS ISLANDS? WILL THE GROUP OF EIGHT SUPPORT ARGENTINA IN THE DEFENSE OF ITS SOVEREIGNTY? THE GROUP OF EIGHT HAS SUPPORTED ARGENTINA FOR A LONG TIME, SO HAS OAS AND THE UN. THEIR SUPPORT IS UNQUESTIONABLE. CUBA MAY JOIN THE OAS. WE HAVE NO OBJECTIONS TO IT. AS FOR PANAMA, IT CONTINUES TO BELONG TO THE OAS BUT NOT TO THE GROUP OF EIGHT. PANAMA HAS BEEN SUSPENDED TEMPORARILY FROM THIS GROUP UNTIL DEMOCRACY RETURNS TO THAT COUNTRY. THIS WILL BE STATED IN A DOCUMENT WE ARE PREPARING DURING THIS MEETING. IS THE PARDON FOR MILITARY OFFICERS AND TERRORISTS IN ARGENTINA DAMAGING THE MORAL HEALTH OF YOUR COUNTRY OR ARGENTINA DEMOCRACY? NO, BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME A PARDON HAS BEEN GRANTED IN THE WORLD. THERE HAVE BEEN PARDONS EVERYWHERE. NOT LONG AGO A PARDON WAS GRANTED IN URUGUAY AND IT HAS BEEN RATIFIED BY THE URUGUAYAN PEOPLE. A PARDON WAS GRANTED IN SPAIN AFTER THE . THERE WERE PARDONS GRANTED AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR. PARDONS AND FORGETTING HAVE ALLOWED THE INTEGRATION OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY. IT ALSO ALLOWED PRESIDENT BUSH TO PAY HOMMAGE TO EMPEROR HIROITO, ONE OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SECOND WORLD WAR, DURING HIS FUNERAL. THEREFORE WE CAN COMPLETELY OVERCOME THIS MATTER. REPORTED THAT ARGENTINA WOULD ASK TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SUMMIT MEETING OF THE PRESIDENTS OF COLOMBIA, PERU, AND BOLIVIA AND THE UNITED STATES. IS THIS TRUE, AND WHAT WOULD BE THE ARGENTINE ROLE IN THIS SUMMIT? NO, THAT IS NOT CORRECT. WE SUPPORT THIS SUMMIT MEETING, AND CONTINUE MAINTAINING OUR SAME ATTITUDE TOWARD THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN COCA PRODUCER AND COCA CONSUMER COUNTRIES. THEY ARE BOTH PART OF A SAME PROCESS, SO WE MUST CARRY OUT AN ALL OUT WAR AGAINST THE THREE PHASES OF DRUG PRODUCTION AND MERCHANDISING. A STRONGER ACTION IS REQUIRED BY ESPECIALLY THE UNITED STATES TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING. I THINK THAT WE NEED THE WILL OF EVERY ONE. WE WOULD NOT GAIN ANYTHING BY RESTRICTING THE PRODUCTION OF COCA IN PERU, COLOMBIA, AND BOLIVIA IF THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT HELP TO SUBSTITUTE THIS CROP. WE CANNOT DIVIDE THIS ACTION. THE FIGHT MUST BE AN ALL OUT WAR BY ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, BECAUSE DRUGS ARE CURRENTLY PRESENT IN ALL COUNTRIES. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE COUNTRY THAT CAN CLAIM THAT THERE IS NO DRUG ADDICITON OR TRAFFICKING IN ITS TERRITORY. NOT LONG AGO, I READ THAT 14 DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE HANGED IN SAUDI ARABIA, WHERE THEY ARE VERY CONSERVATIVE AND WHERE THERE IS STRICT CONTROL OVER ANY KIND OF VICE. WHAT POSITION HAS ARGENTINA MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT THIS MEETING REGARDING THE FOREIGN DEBT ISSUE? DO YOU THINK ALL THE GROUP OF EIGHT MEMBERS WILL ARRIVE TO A JOINT POSITION REGARDING THIS ISSUE? WE ARE CURRENTLY RENEGOTIATING OUR DEBTS INDIVIDUALLY BECAUSE EACH COUNTRY IS DIFFERENT. THE ECONOMIC POLICIES HAVE SO FAR NOT BEEN INTEGRATED BUT THEY MUST BE INTEGRATED. AS LONG AS WE DO NOT ATTAIN INTEGRATION, THE FOREIGN DEBT NEGOTIATIONS WILL BE CARRIED OUT INDIVIDUALLY. IF WE MAKE PROGRESS TOWARDS INTEGRATION, THINGS MAY CHANGE FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL. FOR THE TIME BEING THE NEGOTIATIONS WILL BE CARRIED OUT SEPARATELY. PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA YESTERDAY CALLED FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CONCRETE INTEGRATION GOALS FOR 1992. HAS THIS BEEN DISCUSSED BY THE PRESIDENTS? WILL CONCRETE GOALS BE FIXED? WE ARE DISCUSSING THIS. WE HAVE ALREADY SET CONCRETE GOALS, BASED ON EXPERIENCES. FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE AN ECONOMIC INTEGRATION WITH BRAZIL, WHICH URUGUAY RECENTLY JOINED. THIS MUST SERVE AS AN EXAMPLE FOR THE REST OF THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES. OF COURSE WE MUST NOT FORGET SOME OF THE POSITIVE RESULTS, LIKE IN THE CASE OF THE ANDEAN PACT WHICH IS REVIVING AND REORGANIZING ITSELF, AND OTHER AGREEMENTS NOT ONLY IN LATIN AMERICA BUT IN THE WHOLE AMERICAN CONTINENT. WE ARE HEADING TOWARD A CONTINENTAL UNITY LIKE THAT OF CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES. AFTER LATIN AMERICA ACHIEVES INTEGRATION WE WANT INTEGRATION WITH CENTRAL AND NORTHERN AMERICA. PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO WAS SURPRISED, BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THAT THE CREW OF THE THREE PLANES WE DONATED TO COLOMBIA HAD ALREADY RETURNED TO ARGENTINA. HOWEVER, THEY ARE STILL THERE WAITING FOR THE AIRPLANES TO BE PLACED AT THE SERVICE OF THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.
DEV-MUC3-0572	LIMA, 12 OCT 89 -- THERE ARE SERIOUS DISCREPANCIES AMONG THE PREESIDENTS ATTENDING TO THIS MEETING REGARDING THE FOREIGN DEBT ISSUE. IS IT BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS PREVAILING IN EACH COUNTRY? WE HAVE A COMMON STANCE. NO COUNTRY CAN PAY WHAT IT IS BEING ASKED TO PAY. WE ALL KNOW THIS. PEOPLE KNOW IT. THE LABOR UNIONS KNOW IT. THEREFORE, THAT IS OUR STANCE. A FEW YEARS AGO SOME COUNTRIES MADE AN EFFORT TO PAY. NOWADAY, EVERYBODY KNOWS THEY CANNOT PAY AND THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO CHANGE THE PAYMENT CONDITIONS. THIS IS THE BASIC ISSUE THAT WE ALL SHARE. THE FACT THAT SOME COUNTRIES RESORT TO THE BRADY PLAN, THAT OTHERS SEEK OTHER ALTERNATIVES, OR THAT OTHERS CHOOSE NOT TO PAY A DEBT THAT THEY CONSIDER TO BE UNFAIR -- AT LEAT UNTIL CONDITIONS CHANGE OR PAYMENTS ARE REDUCED -- ARE SIMPLY DIFFERENT SHADES OF A COMMON STANCE. THE IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT WE ARE GRADUALLY VERIFYING THAT NO COUNTRY IS ABLE TO PAY THE DEBT IN CONTRACTED, A DEBT THAT HAS GROWN ONLY BECAUSE OF INTERESTS. I WILL REITERATE SOME DRAMATIC BUT REALISTIC FIGURES: 10 YEARS AGO LATIN AMERICA OWED $190 BILLION. IT PAID $289 BILLION TO DECEMBER 1988 -- THAT IS 10 YEARS -- AND IT STILL OWES $430 BILLION. IN THE PAST 10 YEARS LATIN AMERICA HAS REDUCED ITS PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION DRAMATICALLY BY 2 TO 3 PERCENT A YEAR. IN THE PAST 10 YEARS LATIN AMERICA REDUCED ITS IMPORTS, SEEKING TO SPEND LESS DOLLARS. IT INCREASED ITS EXPORTS AND DEVALUED ITS CURRENCIES TO OBTAIN DOLLARS WITH WHICH TO PAY THE DEBT. IN THE PAST 10 YEARS LATIN AMERICA GREW ONLY 1 PERCENT PER YEAR, AND IT HAS USED THAT 1 PERCENT, PLUS AN ADDITIONAL 4-PERCENT OF ITS GNP, TO PAY THE DEBT. THEREFORE, UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, 10 YEARS LATER WE FIND THAT WE OWE MORE, PRODUCE LESS, AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PAY OUR DEBT. WE ALL KNOW THIS. IT HAS COST US 10 YEARS TO UNDERSTAND IT. HOWEVER IT IS AN EXPERIENCE THAT CONSTITUTES THE BASE FOR OUR COMMON STANCE. HAS PROGRESS BEEN MADE IN THIS FIELD SINCE THE PUNTA DEL ESTE SUMMIT? WOULD THERE HAVE BEEN A BRADY PLAN IF WE HAD NOT MET IN ACAPULCO OR IN PUNTA DEL ESTE? ONE OF JAMES BRADY'S ADVISERS PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES STATING THAT THE BRADY PLAN WAS ANNOUNCED IN SEPTEMBER 1985 TO PREVENT THE DISSEMINATION OF THE PERUVIAN ATTITUDE OF UNILATERALLY REDUCING ITS DEBT PAYMENTS. WHO KNOWS IF THE ACAPULCO AND PUNTA DEL ESTE MEETINGS HAVE NOT LED THE CREDITORS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DEBT IS NOT WORTH ITS FACE VALUE AND THAT IT MUST BE REDUCED? THEREFORE, THERE HAS BEEN PROGRESS. WHO KNOWS IF NEXT YEAR WE WILL BE SPEAKING OF REDUCING THE DEBT BY 50 PERCENT AND NOT JUST THE 20 PERCENT THAT WE NOW SEEK? YOU SEE, THE FACT IS THAT NOT ONLY ARE WE UNABLE TO PAY AND THAT WE ARE NEGOTIATING TO PAY LESS, BUT THE CREDITORS ALSO KNOW THAT THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT THEIR MONEY IF THEY INSIST ON THEIR CLAIMS. THEREFORE, IF THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION ARE HEADING TO WARD DISARMAMENT, WHY CAN'T THERE BE A FINANCIAL DISARMAMENT BETWEEN THE RICH AND POOR? I THINK THAT ECONOMIC TRENDS WILL FOLLOW THIS LINE. PRESIDENT, WHY HASN'T PANAMA BEEN DEFINITIVELY EXPELLED FROM THIS GROUP, AND WILL THE GROUP OF EIGHT EXPAND? PANAMA AS A COUNTRY, INDEPENDENT OF ITS PAST ADMINISTRATIONS, WAS A FOUNDER MEMBER OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT. NO COUNTRY CAN BE EXPELLED. THIS IS A TERM THAT WOULD OFFEND THE CITIZENRY OF A COUNTRY. WE SIMPLY RATIFIED THE SUSPENSION OF PANAMA INDEFINITELY UNTIL PANAMA IS GOVERNED BY A DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT. THAT WAS OUR DECISION. THE OAS? WE ARE PREPARING A PROPOSAL IN WHICH WE STATE THAT THE OAS IS AN IMPORTANT FORUM OR MECHANISM FOR HEMISPHERIC DIALOGUE BUT WHICH MUST INCLUDE THE PRESENCE OF CUBA AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH ARE YET NOT MEMBERS. WILL THE GROUP OF EIGHT EXPAND? I HOPE SO. THIS IS THE LAST YEAR IN WHICH I WILL ATTEND A MEETING OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT, WHICH I HELPED TO CREATE. HOWEVER, I HOPE THIS GROUP WILL LEAD ANNUAL AND PERIODICAL MEETINGS OF ALL LATIN AMERICA PRESIDENTS. I HAVE MAINTAINED THIS HOPE SINCE 1985. I HOPE THAT LATIN AMERICA WILL ANNUALLY COORDINATE SOME KIND OF COLLEGIAL EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO MAKE IMPORTANT DECISIONS. THE GROUP OF EIGHT IS THE BEGINNING OF THIS, AND I AM SURE THAT IT WILL EXPAND IN THE FUTURE. HOWEVER, AT A CONTINENTAL LEVEL, THE ISSUES CANNOT RUN AS FAST AS FOR A COUNTRY, A PEOPLE, OR A POLITICAL PROCESS. A CONTINENT REQUIRES MUCH LONGER TERMS AND WE MUST BE PATIENT. LET US GO TO ANOTHER SUBJECT NOW. HUMAN RIGHTS. TWO OF THE MAIN ISSUES IN LATIN AMERICAN LIFE ARE DEMOCRATIZATION AND HUMAN RIGHTS. PRESIDENT MENEM HAS RECENTLY PARDONED MILITARY OFFICERS AND TERRORISTS WHO WERE SERVING PRISON SENTENCES. THERE IS ALSO A CONFLICTIVE SITUATION IN PERU REGARDING SOME MILITARY OFFICERS WHO ARE BEING TRIED FOR MURDERS COMMITTED IN JAILS. ARE YOU WILLING TO PARDON THOSE MILITARY OFFICERS TO PACIFY THE SITUATION? THIS IS MY FIRST QUESTION. SECOND, THE PERUVIAN IMAGE THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA IS VERY BAD BECAUSE OF A LACK OF INFORMATION. IN CONTRAST WITH ACAPULCO AND PUNTA DEL ESTE, WHICH ARE HOLIDAY RESORTS WITH MULTIMILLION DOLLAR INFRASTRUCTURES, THE CITY OF ICA REPRESENTS THOUSANDS OF LATIN AMERICAN CITIES. THEREFORE, WHAT IS YOUR ADMINISTRATION DOING TO THRUTHFULLY REPORT ON PERUVIAN REALITY? TION DOING TO THRUTHFULLY REPORT ON PERUVIAN REALITY?
DEV-MUC3-0573	CUCUTA, 13 OCT 89 -- THE FAMILY OF NORBERTO RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ, THE BROTHER-IN-LAW OF VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, SAID TODAY THAT THE PEOPLE WHO KIDNAPPED 72-YEAR-OLD RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ ARE ASKING FOR $10 MILLION, APPROXIMATELY 4.1 BILLION PESOS, FOR HIS RELEASE. INES RODRIGUEZ COLMENARES, DAUGHTER OF THE KIDNAPPED MAN, TODAY READ A STATEMENT ON THE PRIVATELY OWNED RCN , THE MAIN RADIO STATION ALONG THE COLOMBIAN - VENEZUELAN BORDER, IN WHICH THE FAMILY STATES THAT THE SUM REQUESTED IS "UNIMAGINABLE." RODRIGUEZ, FORMER VENEZUELAN CONSUL IN CUCUTA, WAS KIDNAPPED ON 14 JULY BY FOUR PERSONS WHO HAD REMAINED SILENT UNTIL A FEW HOURS AGO. IN THEIR STATEMENT, THE RODRIGUEZ FAMILY SAID THAT THE $10 MILLION RANSOM IS NOT WITHIN THEIR REACH AND ADDED THAT "THE KIDNAPPERS MUST KNOW WHAT OUR REAL ECONOMIC CAPACITY IS." "WE ARE WILLING TO NEGOTIATE OUR FATHER'S RELEASE, BUT WITHIN OUR MEANS," THE DOCUMENT ADDS. THE KIDNAPPERS, BELIEVED TO BE MEMBERS OF THE PRO-CASTRO ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION , REPORTEDLY ADVISED THE RODRIGUEZ FAMILY YESTERDAY OF THEIR DECISION TO NEGOTIATE HIS RELEASE. NORBERTO RODRIGUEZ IS THE BROTHER OF BLANCA DE PEREZ, WIFE OF VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ.
DEV-MUC3-0574	QUITO, 12 OCT 89 -- THIS YEAR, FRANCE WILL GRANT ECUADOR A 310 MILLION-FRANC LOAN AND A NON-REPAYABLE LOAN FOR 20 MILLION. FRANCE WILL ALSO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, AND WILL SUPPORT ECUADOR'S STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND ITS EFFORTS TO SOLVE ECUADOR'S FOREIGN DEBT PROBLEM, PRESIDENTS FRANCOIS MITTERRAND AND RODRIGO BORJA ANNOUNCED TODAY IN QUITO. THUS, THE FRENCH AID TO ECUADOR IN 1989 WILL TOTAL 400 MILLION FRANCS, SINCE FRANCE PREVIOUSLY AGREED TO GRANT LOANS FOR 180 MILLION FRANCS TO ECUADOR. THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE ON 12 OCTOBER, SHORTLY BEFORE MITTERRAND CONCLUDED HIS OFFICIAL 2-DAY VISIT TO ECUADOR, WHERE HE HELD A PRIVATE MEETING WITH BORJA -- A FELLOW MEMBER OF SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL -- AFTER ECUADORAN FOREIGN MINISTER DIEGO CORDOVEZ AND EDWIGE AVICE, DELEGATE FROM THE FRENCH MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, SIGNED AN LETTER OF INTENTION. FROM THE TOTAL LOANS, 165 MILLION FRANCS WILL BE USED FOR THE FIRST PHASE OF A PROJECT TO REHABILITATE THE CENTRAL RAILROAD. THE PROJECT INCLUDES THE REHABILITATION OF 900 KM OF THE RAILWAY LINE BETWEEN THE ECUADORAN MOUNTAIN RANGE AND THE ECUADORAN COAST, BORJA SAID. HE REVEALED THAT THE LOAN IS TO BE PAID BACK IN 25 YEARS, WITH A 5-YEAR GRACE PERIOD AND LOW INTEREST RATES. HE ALSO NOTED THE SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT, IN A COUNTRY WITH DIFFICULT AND RUGGED TERRAIN. THE REMAINING FUNDS WILL BE USED TO SUPPLY POTABLE WATER TO THE PROVINCES OF IMBABURA IN THE MOUNTAIN RANGE, AND MANABI IN THE COASTAL REGION. WITH REGARD TO ECUADOR'S FOREIGN DEBT, WHICH EXCEEDS $11 BILLION, MITTERRAND SAID HE IS "WILLING TO PERSONALLY ASSIST," IN THE STUDY OF BILATERAL AGREEMENTS TO REDUCE THE DEBT BURDEN, AND TO INTERCEDE BEFORE THE PARIS CLUB, TO WHICH ECUADOR OWES $400 MILLION. MITTERRAND ASKED BORJA TO GIVE HIM TIME TO STUDY THE BILATERAL AGREEMENTS ON THE DEBT. IN THIS REGARD, MITTERRAND CLEARLY EXPRESSED THAT THE DEBT WILL NOT BE FORGIVEN. HE BELIEVES THIS IS AN OVERALL PROBLEM AND IS "MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE ATOMIC BOMB," BECAUSE THE COUNTRIES FACING THIS PROBLEM CANNOT CONTROL IT." AT THE SAME TIME, MITERRAND ASKED: "WHO CAN CONTROL THE MISERY AND THE DISTURBANCES" THIS PROBLEM WILL GENERATE? MITTERRAND ADDED THAT EFFORTS WILL BE MADE TO IMPROVE THE WEAK BILATERAL TRADE, WHICH IN 1988 TOTALLED 321.3 MILLION FRANCS , WITH A DEFICIT OF 56.5 MILLION FRANCS FOR ECUADOR . MITTERRAND SAID FRENCH EXPERTS WILL STUDY THE POSSIBILITY OF BOOSTING SALES OF ECUADORAN PRODUCTS TO FRANCE, ESPECIALLY SEAFOOD PRODUCTS, SUCH AS SHRIMP, AS WELL AS BANANAS, WHICH FRANCE CURRENTLY BUYS FROM AFRICAN COUNTRIES. "WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS OPEN NEW DOORS," MITTERRAND ADDED. HOWEVER, HE INSISTED ON THE NEED TO WAIT FOR THE STUDIES THE EXPERTS WILL CARRY OUT. THE CHIEFS OF STATE ANNOUNCED THE SIGNING OF A COOPERATION AGREEMENT TO STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, STILL AT AN EARLY STAGE IN ECUADOR. THROUGH THIS AGREEMENT, SIGNED BY ECUADORAN GOVERNMENT MINISTER ANDRES VALLEJO AND FRENCH INTERIOR MINISTER PIERRE JOXE, A PLAN WILL BE DRAFTED TO STRUGGLE AGAINST THIS SCOURGE. FRANCE WILL PROVIDE ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT AND OTHER SUPPLIES TO THE ECUADORAN POLICE. MITTERRAND SAID HE THOROUGHLY DISCUSSED THIS PROBLEM WITH BORJA, ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT A SPECIFIC PROBLEM OF ECUADOR, WHICH IS NOT A PRODUCING COUNTRY, BUT IS USED FOR THE TRANSSHIPMENT OF DRUGS. HE MADE AN APPEAL TO ORGANIZE A WORLD FRONT TO ELIMINATE THIS SCOURGE. BORJA CONFIRMED MITTERRAND'S STATEMENTS AND ADDED THAT ALTHOUGH ECUADOR "IS NOT A DRUG-PRODUCING COUNTRY, WE WILL NOT REST," BECAUSE I BELIEVE OTHER COUNTRIES "BEGAN LATE" IN THEIR STRUGGLE AGAINST THIS EVIL. THE TWO PRESIDENTS AGREED ON THE NEED TO CONCERTED EFFORTS -- AMONG COUNTRIES PRODUCING AND CONSUMING DRUGS, COUNTRIES USED FOR THE TRANSSHIPMENT OF DRUGS, AND FOR MONEY LAUNDERING -- TO FACE THIS SCOURGE. THE TWO PRESIDENTS COMMITTED THEIR EFFORTS IN THIS RESPECT. MITTERRAND, WHO UPON CONCLUDING HIS VISIT TO ECUADOR WILL MAKE A STOPOVER IN BOGOTA, SAID THAT HIS UNSCHEDULED VISIT TO COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO IS "TO GIVE OPEN TESTIMONY ON THE SOLIDARITY THAT MUST BE GIVEN TO THE PRESIDENT OF SUCH A COURAGEOUS GOVERNMENT. FINALLY, MITTERRAND NOTED THE BENEFITS OF HIS VISIT TO ECUADOR -- WHICH HE EXPECTS TO REPEAT -- AND THE ENTHUSIASTIC WELCOMING HE RECEIVED. BORJA THANKED THIS "GREAT EUROPEAN AND WORLD LEADER, WHO IS OFFERING HIS FRIENDSHIP TO US," FOR HIS VISIT.
DEV-MUC3-0575	BOGOTA, 14 OCT 89 -- THE WAVE OF CRIMINAL ATTACKS TO WHICH COLOMBIAN JOURNALISTS ARE CURRENTLY BEING SUBJECTED CONTINUED LAST NIGHT WHEN WILLIAM BENDECK OLIVELLA, DIRECTOR OF A RADIO NEWSCAST IN THE NORTHERN CITY OF MONTERIA, WAS KILLED BY UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS. ACCORDING TO REPORTS RECEIVED IN BOGOTA, THE NEWSMAN, 57, WAS ABOUT TO ENTER HIS HOME WHEN HE WAS GUNNED DOWN BY SEVERAL ARMED MEN. BENDECK OLIVELLA HAD BEEN PRESS ASSISTANT TO NICARAGUAN DICTATOR ANASTASIO SOMOZA, BUT WENT TO COLOMBIA AFTER THE TRIUMPH OF THE SANDINIST REVOLUTION. BENDECK OLIVELLA IS THE SECOND NEWSMAN TO BE MURDERED THIS WEEK. ON TUESDAY, SEVERAL GUNMEN KILLED ROBERTO SARASTY BOTERO, WHO WORKED FOR THE CARACOL RADIO NETWORK IN MEDELLIN. ALTHOUGH THE AUTHORITIES DO NOT YET HAVE DETAILED INFORMATION, THE POSSIBILITY THAT BENDECK OLIVELLA MAY HAVE BEEN MURDERED FOR POLITICAL REASONS HAS NOT BEEN RULED OUT SINCE HE WAS A POLITICAL SPECIALIST. FOR MORE THAN A MONTH, NEWSMEN IN COLOMBIA HAVE BEEN FACING A SERIOUS THREAT FROM THE DRUG TRAFFICKING MAFIA, WHICH EVEN PARTIALLY DESTROYED THE MAIN OFFICES OF THE BOGOTA MORNING PAPER EL ESPECTADOR, IN REPRISAL FOR THE PAPER'S HARSH ATTACKS ON THE COCAINE TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS.
DEV-MUC3-0576	MOSCOW , 12 OCT 89 -- WE HAD BEEN LEFT COMPLETELY ALONE AND ISOLATED FROM THE WORLD, THE POPULAR GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN OVERTHROWN, THE DICTATORSHIP HAD SCATTERED CONCENTRATION CAMPS AND ANONYMOUS DEAD AROUND THE COUNTRY, CONGRESS WAS CLOSED, ALL LEFTIST COMMUNICATION MEDIA WERE ALSO CLOSED, AND THE IMAGE OF THE DICTATORSHIP MONOPOLIZED THE TELEVISION SCREENS. PINOCHET NEEDED TO BE LEFT ALONE IN ORDER TO CONSOLIDATE HIS POWER BY MURDERING HIS OPPONENTS. AT THE SAME TIME, HE SENT MISSIONS ABROAD TO SEEK RECOGNITION AND SUPPORT. IN THE FIRST DAYS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE COUP, RADIO MOSCOW BEGAN TO BEAM PROGRAMS TO CHILE, AND I AM NOW TALKING TO YOU FROM ITS STUDIOS. VOLODIA TEITELBOIM, CURRENT SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE CHILEAN COMMUNIST PARTY, WAS BY CHANCE IN MOSCOW IN SEPTEMBER 1973, AND IT FELL TO HIM TO INITIATE THE PROGRAMS "LISTEN, CHILE" AND RADIO MAGALLANES OVER THE MICROPHONES OF RADIO MOSCOW. THE AUDIENCE OF THESE PROGRAMS SUDDENLY GREW INSIDE CHILE. AT FIRST, THE PROGRAMS DENOUNCED THE ARBITRARY ACTION OF THE MILITARY REGIME. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SMUGGLE NEWS OUT OF CHILE SO THAT IT COULD BE BROADCAST ALL OVER CHILE BY RADIO MOSCOW, BUT NEWS OF THE WORLD'S SOLIDARITY WAS BROADCAST NIGHT AFTER NIGHT TO CHILE. THUS, THE WALL OF SILENCE THE DICTATOR INTENDED TO RAISE AROUND HIM TO HIDE HIS CRIMES WAS CRACKED. A TRADITION OF LISTENING RADIO MOSCOW PROGRAMS TO LATIN AMERICA WAS DEVELOPED IN CHILE AS ATTESTED BY THE MAIL THAT REACHED ITS STUDIOS. THE BULK OF MAIL FROM CHILE CONFIRMS THIS. SO IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT THE MOSCOW TRANSMISSIONS WERE HELPING THE CAUSE OF THE PERSECUTED, THE WORKERS, THE STUDENTS, THE PRISONERS, THE MUZZLED DEMOCRATS, AND THE GRIEVING WIDOWS OF CHILE. THROUGH THESE TRANSMISSIONS, THOSE PEOPLE RECEIVED THE MESSAGE OF SUPPORT AN ENCOURAGEMENT SENT BY THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD. THE FIRST BROADCASTS WERE MADE IN THOSE YEARS, AND VERY FEW HAVE NOT LISTENED TO THEM AT SOME TIME, ALTHOUGH NOBODY ADMITTED TO KNOWLEDGE OF THOSE PROGRAMS. THE TYRANT HIMSELF VIOLENTLY ATTACKED THE PROGRAMS IN SEVERAL PUBLIC SPEECHES. NOT LONG AGO, PINOCHET'S FOREIGN MINISTER AGAIN SCATHINGLY REFERRED TO RADIO MOSCOW'S BROADCASTS. THAT IS TO SAY THAT THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE CONTINUED TO AFFECT THE DICTATORSHIP IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND THAT THEY HAVE HELPED THE RESURGENCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES. THE RESURGENCE AND ORGANIZATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES THROUGH THE IMPETUS OF THE WORKERS AND BROAD SECTORS OF THE POPULATION HAVE RESHAPED THE CHILEAN POLITICAL SITUATION, TO THE POINT THAT WE ARE NOW APPROACHING THE REAL POSSIBILITY OF AN ELECTORAL TRIUMPH BY A SINGLE OPPOSITION CANDIDATE TO THE PRESIDENCY, THUS SETTING THE PROCESS OF TRANSITION IN MOTION. IN FACT THE SITUATION NOT ONLY HAS CHANGED IN CHILE, BUT ALSO IN THE SOVIET UNION WHERE THE PERESTROYKA -- A REVOLUTIONARY PROCESS INSIDE A REVOLUTION -- HAS OPENED IMMENSE POSSIBILITIES FOR THE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT OF SOVIET SOCIETY. WE FREQUENTLY KEEP YOU ABREAST OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PROGRAMS OF RADIO MOSCOW. SO, ALL THIS HAS GALVANIZED OUR DISPOSITION TO CONTINUE COOPERATING IN THIS PROCES THAT HAS REACHED NEW LEVELS. OUR PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO BE OPEN AND AT THE DISPOSAL OF ALL ADVANCE FORCES THAT MARCH WITH THE DEMOCRATS. A FEW WEEKS AGO, RADIO MOSCOW COMPLETED 16 YEARS OF BROADCAST TO CHILE. NOW, ON 29 OCTOBER RADIO MOSCOW WILL CELEBRATE ITS 60TH ANNIVERSARY. ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD KNOW THE PROGRAMS OF RADIO MOSCOW IN 81 LANGUAGES. THE PROGRAMS TO CHILE HAVE A PRIVILEGED PLACE AMONG THEM. FOR THE OCCASION, GREETINGS HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE PROGRAMS OF RADIO MOSCOW AND RADIO MAGALLANES. FROM CHILEANS SCATTERED IN 40 COUNTRIES BY THE FASCIST EXPLOSION, RADIO MOSCOW ALSO RECEIVES MAIL AND POSTCARD WITH MESSAGES OF APPRECIATION AND THANKS. THIS IS A MODEST WAY OF RESPONDING TO THE VALUABLE ASSISTANCE RADIO MOSCOW HAS GIVEN, IS GIVING, AND WILL CONTINUE TO GIVE US. WE HAD BEEN LEFT ALONE, ISOLATED FROM THE WORLD, AND RADIO MOSCOW PROVED TO BE OUR FRIEND DURING SHAMEFUL TIMES. GOOD NIGHT.
DEV-MUC3-0577	LIMA, 15 OCT 89 -- VICTOR POLAY, THE LEADER OF THE PERUVIAN TERRORIST TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT GROUP, TODAY ADMITTED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE MRTA WILL PROPOSE HIS RELEASE IN EXCHANGE FOR THE RELEASE OF TELEVISION IMPRESARIO HECTOR DELGADO PARKER. POLAY IS BEING HELD AT A PENITENTIARY IN LIMA. THE REMARKS BY POLAY, WHO WAS CAPTURED BY PERUVIAN POLICE IN FEBRUARY 1989 IN THE CITY OF HUANCAYO, 315 KM EAST OF LIMA, WERE PUBLISHED TODAY BY THE LIMA DAILY "LA REPUBLICA," WHICH INTERVIEWED HIM AT HIS CELL IN LIMA'S CANTO GRANDE PENITENTIARY. LAST THURDAY , THE WEEKLY "CAMBIO," WHICH IS DESCRIBED BY POLICE SOURCES AS THE MRTA'S UNOFFICIAL MOUTHPIECE, REPORTED THAT THE MRTA -- WHICH UPHOLDS THE BELIEFS OF GUERRILLA ERNESTO "CHE" GUEVARA -- KIDNAPPED IMPRESARIO DELGADO PARKER ON 4 OCTOBER 1989 IN LIMA, SAYING THAT HE WILL BE TRIED "BY A REVOLUTIONARY COURT." DELGADO PARKER WAS AN ADVISER TO PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA AND IS THE GODFATHER OF ONE OF HIS DAUGHTERS. POLAY TOLD "LA REPUBLICA" THAT THE KIDNAPPING OF THE IMPORTANT PERUVIAN TELEVISION IMPRESARIO IS OF A"POLITICAL" NATURE AND IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER KIDNAPPINGS OF OTHER PROMINENT TYCOONS CARRIED OUT BY THE MRTA PEOPLE TO OBTAIN RANSOM MONEY, AND THAT, THEREFORE, THE PETITION THAT WILL BE MADE "MUST BE POLITICAL." POLAY TOLD "LA REPUBLICA" THAT HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DELGADO PARKER'S KIDNAPPING, A BLOODY ACTION IN WHICH THE IMPRESARIO'S DRIVER WAS KILLED AND THE IMPRESARIO'S BODYGUARD WAS INJURED. POLAY SAID THAT HE CANNOT PREDICT THE DECISION THAT THE "REVOLUTIONARY COURT" WILL MAKE AFTER THE "PEOPLE'S JUDGMENT" TO WHICH THE IMPRESARIO WILL BE SUBJECTED. POLAY, HOWEVER, ADMITTED THE POSSIBILITY OF AN EXCHANGE DEAL BECAUSE "THE KIDNAPPING IS POLITICAL AND THE PETITION THAT WILL BE MADE MUST BE POLITICAL." THE PUBLICATION OF POLAY'S INTERVIEW TODAY COINCIDES WITH REPORTS BY LOCAL NEWSPAPERS ON THE CAPTURE OF 12 REGIONAL MRTA LEADERS. THIS NEWS WAS ANNOUNCED IN THE CITY OF CAJAMARCA, 870 KM NORTH OF LIMA. THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THE OPERATIONS, LEADING TO THE CAPTURE OF THE MRTA LEADERS, HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, AND THAT ACTIVISTS, WHO WERE OPERTING IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF CAJAMARCA, LA LIBERTAD, AND ANCASH IN NORTHERN PERU AND WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR AT LEAST 20 BOMB ATTACKS IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS, HAVE BEEN DETAINED. THE NATIONAL POLICE ADDED THAT FIREARMS, EXPLOSIVES, AND PROPAGANDA MATERIAL WERE SEIZED FROM THE MRTA LEADERS.
DEV-MUC3-0578	BOGOTA, 5 OCT 89 -- IT IS A PLEASURE FOR ME TO MEET WITH PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO FOR THE SECOND TIME, IN MY ROLE AS PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA, TO TO CONTINUE REVIEWING -- 6 MONTHS LATER -- ISSUES WHICH ARE OF MUTUAL INTEREST TO OUR TWO NATIONS. I ALSO WISH TO PROVE WITH THIS ACTION THAT WE ARE WILLING TO CARRY OUT OUR PLANS FOR COOPERATION AND MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING. ON THIS OCCASION WE ARE PROVING THAT WE WANT TO PERMANENTLY FOLLOW UP THE GOALS ESTABLISHED DURING OUR FIRST MEETING. HOWEVER, PRESIDENT BARCO, ON THIS OCCASION I WISH TO STATE -- LIKE I PERSONALLY TOLD YOU ON THE TELEPHONE UPON LEARNING THE UNFORTUNATE AND TRAGIC NEWS ABOUT THE ASSASSINATION OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN, AN ADMIRED FRIEND AND A GREAT COLOMBIAN -- THAT I WANTED TO HOLD THIS MEETING BECAUSE THE VENEZUELAN FEELINGS WHICH I REPRESENT AND PERSONIFY COMPELLED ME TO PERSONALLY EXPRESS TO YOU, AS PRESIDENT OF COLOMBIA, VENEZUELA'S AND THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE'S SOLIDARITY WITH THE EXTRAORDINARY AND ADMIRABLE STRUGGLE THAT COLOMBIA IS CURRENTLY WAGING AGAINST AN ENEMY OF MANKIND -- DRUG TRAFFICKING. I WANT TO STATE HERE THAT THIS WAS ENOUGH REASON FOR THE VENEZUELA GOVERNMENT TO REQUEST, THROUGH ITS PRESIDENT, A PERSONAL INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT BARCO SO THAT IT MAY BE KNOWN THAT VENEZUELA'S SOLIDARITY GOES BEYOND WORDS.
DEV-MUC3-0579	SAN JOSE , 16 OCT 89 -- A DARK CLOUD OF SKEPTICISM LOOMED OVER THE TALKS BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT AT THE END OF THE FIRST ROUND OF TALKS TODAY, BECAUSE THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE DIALOGUE WERE UNABLE, REPEAT UNABLE, TO REACH AGREEMENT ON THE BASIC POINTS FOR A POSSIBLE CEASE-FIRE. THE DELEGATIONS MET AT THE PASTORAL HOUSE OF THE CLARIST NUNS' CONGREGATION IN MORAVIA, 4 KM FROM SAN JOSE. OSCAR ARIAS, THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT AND NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNER, VISITED THE PLACE AND ENCOURAGED THE PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEET "BECAUSE THE SALVADORAN WAR IS SENSELESS AND SHOULD NOT, REPEAT SHOULD NOT, CONTINUE." ARIAS ADDED: "I KNOW OF NOTHING THAT IS BETTER THAN DIALOGUE." GREGORIO ROSAS CHAVEZ, THE AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, STATED: "I FOSTER HOPES THAT AN AGREEMENT WILL BE REACHED." WHEN THE MEETING STARTED AND, AFTER THE INITIAL FORMALITIES, THE REPRESENTATIVES BEGAN TO DISCUSS THE KEY POINTS. THE FMLN PROPOSED THE FOLLOWING POINTS AT THE MEETING: 1. THE NEED TO ADVANCE THE DATE OF THE GENERAL ELECTIONS; 2. THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONSIGNIOR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO'S MURDER TO BE SENT TO TRIAL; 3. REFORMS TO THE POLITICAL CONSTITUTION; 4. PURGING AND PROFESSIONALIZING THE ARMY; 5. ENDING REPRESSION; 6. FULL ENFORCEMENT OF DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS; 7. REFORMS TO THE SALVADORAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM; 8. PROVISIONAL ECONOMIC MEASURES TO DEACTIVATE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CONFRONTATION. IN SYNTHESIS, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT PROPOSED "STOPPING HOSTILITIES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE OAS AND UN DELEGATES." JUAN ANTONIO MARTINEZ, HEAD OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DELEGATION, ALSO PROPOSED THAT "FMLN MEMBERS BE GIVEN ALL THE REQUIRED FACILITIES TO RETURN TO SALVADORAN POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC LIFE, IMMEDIATELY AFTER A CEASE-FIRE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED." AFTER THE FIRST ROUND OF TALKS WAS OVER, JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE FMLN DELEGATION, SAID: "WE REACHED NO SPECIFIC ACCORDS." ANOTHER FMLN LEADER SHAFICK HANDAL POINTED OUT THAT "THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSALS ARE UNACCEPTABLE TO US FOR THE TIME BEING." REPRESENTING THE GOVERNMENT, SALVADORAN JUSTICE MINISTER OSCAR SANTAMARIA SAID: "WE MADE LITTLE PROGRESS; THE GOVERNMENT HOLDS A SPECIFIC POSITION ON HOW TO ACHIEVE A CEASE-FIRE, WHICH IS WHAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING." AT THE END OF THE FIRST ROUND OF THE DIALOGUE, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN ARE DEADLOCKED ON AN ESSENTIAL ISSUE -- THE CEASE-FIRE. THE FMLN MAINTAINS THAT A CEASE-FIRE SHOULD FOLLOW GOVERNMENT COMPLIANCE WITH A NUMBER OF MEASURES WHILE THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT MAINTAINS THAT A CEASE-FIRE MUST COME BEFORE ANY CHANGES TAKE PLACE. IT WAS LEARNED THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT CATEGORICALLY REJECTED AN FMLN PROPOSAL TO HOLD NEW ELECTIONS SOON. THE FMLN ALSO CATEGORICALLY REJECTED THE GOVERNMENT'S CEASE-FIRE PROPOSAL, BECAUSE THAT "WOULD CONSTITUTE SURRENDER." "WE WANT A CEASE-FIRE, BUT THEY MUST COMPLY WITH CERTAIN STEPS THAT WE ARE PROPOSING," COMMANDER JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS SAID. "WE WANT A CEASE-FIRE FIRST AND THEN NEGOTIATIONS," SALVADORAN PRESIDENCY MINISTER JUAN ANTONIO MARTINEZ SAID. THE SECOND ROUND OF THE DIALOGUE WILL TAKE PLACE ON 17 OCTOBER AT 1400 GMT.
DEV-MUC3-0580	SAN SALVADOR, 17 OCT 89 -- THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF EL SALVADOR STRONGLY CONDEMNS THE BASE AND COWARDLY MURDER OF MS DOLORES ISABEL CASANOVA PORRAS, CARRIED OUT THIS MORNING BY FMLN TERRORISTS IN SANTA TECLA AS THE INNOCENT VICTIM WAS ON HER WAY TO HER SPORTS EXERCISES. THIS CRIME, VICIOUSLY AND COLDLY CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN, CLEARLY SHOWS THE WORLD THE FMLN IS AN ORGANIZATION LED AND MADE UP BY INDIVIDUALS FOR WHOM HUMAN LIFE MEANS NOTHING. THIS DESPICABLE CRIME PERPETRATED AGAINST MS CASONOVA PORRAS CONFIRMS THE FMLN IS IMPLEMENTING A DEATH-LIKE TERRORIST PLAN THAT INCLUDES THE MURDER OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND THEIR RELATIVES, AS THE PRESIDENT PUBLICLY CHARGED ON 14 OCTOBER. CONDEMNING THIS NEW CRIME BY FMLN URBAN CELLS, THE GOVERNMENT ASKS: HOW CAN FMLN LEADERS IN COSTA RICA TALK OF PEACE AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS WHEN DEFENSELESS PERSONS ARE BEING RUTHLESSLY AND IRRATIONALLY MURDERED ON ORDERS FROM THE FMLN? THE GOVERNMENT HEREBY CONVEYS ITS DEEP CONDOLENCES AND SOLIDARITY TO MS CASANOVA PORRAS' FAMILY OVER THIS IRREPARABLE LOSS. MOREOVER, IT ASKS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OF NATIONS AND HUMAN RIGHTS RAPPORTEUR PROFESSOR PASTOR RIDREJO TO TAKE DUE NOTICE OF THIS DESPICABLE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN AT A TIME WHEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DELEGATION IS ENGAGED IN A DIALOGUE IN GOOD FAITH AND WITH THE BEST POLITICAL INTENTIONS TO REACH PEACE, SOMETHING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE YEARN FOR. THE GOVERNMENT HOLDS THE FMLN RESPONSIBLE FOR JEOPARDIZING THE DIALOGUE PROCESS TO REACH PEACE, AND HOPES THAT THE FMLN ADOPTS A RESPONSIBLE STAND AND THAT ITS PEACEFUL WORDS ARE MATCHED BY DEEDS.
DEV-MUC3-0581	SAN JOSE, 17 OCT 89 -- NO CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT WAS REACHED AT THE END OF THE SECOND DAY OF THE CURRENT ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN DELEGATES OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT AND THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT. THE DELEGATIONS MET IN THE PASTORAL HOUSE OF THE CONGREGATION OF THE NUNS OF ST CLARE IN MORAVIA, 4 KM FROM SAN JOSE. DURING THE DIALOGUE, THE DELEGATES BECAME INVOLVED IN A DISCUSSION ON IMPLEMENTATION OF A POSSIBLE CEASE-FIRE AND THE FMLN INSISTED THAT THERE MUST FIRST BE APPROVAL OF A PLAN TO AMEND THE SALVADORAN CONSTITUTION, THAT THE ARMY BE PURGED, THAT THE REPRESSION END, THAT MODIFICATIONS TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM BE STARTED, AND THAT MEASURES BE ADOPTED TO GUARANTEE THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIZATION. FOR THEIR PART, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DELEGATES INSISTED THAT THE FMLN MUST DECLARE AN IMMEDIATE HALT TO HOSTILITIES EFFECTIVE 18 OCTOBER. THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL INDICATED THAT "IT COMMITS ITSELF TO HALT ALL OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS AND TO OFFER GUARANTEES TO RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF ALL GUERRILLAS SO THAT THEY CAN JOIN THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC LIFE." FMLN COMMANDER JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS SAID: "WE CANNOT ACCEPT THE GOVERNMENT'S CONDITIONS FOR THE CEASE-FIRE BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN A SURRENDER ON OUR PART." FMLN SPOKESMAN MIGUEL SAENZ SAID: "THERE ARE NO AGREEMENTS WITH THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THERE ARE NO CONCRETE REPLIES TO OUR REQUESTS." SAENZ SAID: "SINCE THERE IS NO FLEXIBILITY ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATES, THERE ARE NO AGREEMENTS FOR PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY." JUSTICE MINISTER OSCAR ALFREDO SANTAMARIA SAID: "FIRST WE NEED THE FMLN TO CEASE HOSTILITIES, THEN THE GOVERNMENT WILL GUARANTEE THAT THE GUERRILLAS CAN RETURN TO THE MAINSTREAM OF SOCIETY. SANTAMARIA REITERATED: "WE WANT PEACE, AN END TO THE WAR, AND AN END TO THE KILLING, THE PAIN, AND THE BITTERNESS OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE." UN ENVOY ALVARO SOTO AND OAS ENVOY RICARDO GJIVOJE ARE ATTENDING THE DIALOGUE AS OBSERVERS, AS WELL AS MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR. DURING THE SECOND DAY OF TALKS, THERE WAS FRICTION BETWEEN THE FMLN AND THE GOVERNMENT WHEN INFORMATION SECRETARY MAURICIO SANDOVAL OPENLY ACCUSED THE FMLN OF MURDERING ANA ISABEL CASANOVA , DAUGHTER OF COLONEL OSCAR EDGARDO CASANOVA, DIRECTOR OF THE ARMED FORCES STUDIES CENTER. FMLN COMMANDER "LUISA" MERCEDES DEL CARMEN RETANA IMMEDIATELY DENIED SANDOVAL'S CHARGE AND SAID: "THE FMLN HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT MURDER PERPETRATED TODAY IN SAN SALVADOR." THE MURDER ALSO PROMPTED ACCUSATIONS IN THE MEETING BY THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES WHO SAID: "THE FMLN IS IN THE HABIT OF PERPETRATING THIS SORT OF ACTIONS WHEN IMPORTANT MEETINGS ARE BEING HELD." THE FMLN DELEGATES SAID: "THE CHARGE AGAINST THE FMLN IS GROUNDLESS." THIS AFTERNOON, MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ SEEMED VERY SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE RESULTS OF THE SAN JOSE TALKS, "BECAUSE FOR THE DIALOGUE TO SUCCEED IT IS NECESSARY AND URGENT THAT THE TWO SIDES, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN, YIELD A LITTLE." IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE DIALOGUE MAY CONTINUE TOMORROW WHEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN ANNOUNCED THEY WILL ISSUE SEPARATE PRESS RELEASES.
DEV-MUC3-0582	BOGOTA, 17 OCT 89 -- THE AUTHORITIES HAVE REPORTED THAT RADIO ANNOUNCER DIEGO VARGAS ESCOBAR WAS ASSASSINATED TODAY IN MEDELLIN, IN NORTHWESTERN COLOMBIA. THIS IS THE SECOND SUCH CRIME TO SHAKE MEDELLIN IN LESS THAN 12 HOURS. THE POLICE SAID VARGAS ESCOBAR, 56, WAS SHOT TO DEATH BY TWO MEN RIDING A MOTORCYCLE AS HE ARRIVED AT HIS HOUSE AT 1950 . THE AUTHORITIES REPORTED THAT THE ASSASSINS FLED AFTER COMMITTING THE ASSASSINATION. THEY SAID THEY DO NOT KNOW THE MOTIVE. DIEGO VARGAS ESCOBAR HAD WORKED AT CADENA RADIAL COLOMBIANA UNTIL 2 MONTHS AGO, AND SINCE THEN HE HAS BEEN WORKING AT THE VOICE OF AMERICA. THE ANNOUNCER'S ASSASSINATION CAME ONLY 12 HOURS AFTER "THE EXTRADITABLES," THE ARMED WING OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, GUNNED DOWN JUDGE HECTOR JIMENEZ RODRIGUEZ IN MEDELLIN, THE COUNTRY'S SECOND MOST IMPORTANT CITY, LOCATED 250 KM NORTHWEST OF BOGOTA.
DEV-MUC3-0583	SAN JOSE, 18 OCT 89 -- THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT TODAY AGREED TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THE DIALOGUE AND TO MEET IN OTHER COUNTRIES EVERY MONTH DESPITE THE DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES. ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT COULD NOT CONVINCE THE GUERRILLAS TO LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND RETURN TO POLITICAL LIFE AND THE FMLN COULD NOT SUCCEED IN SECURING FROM THE AUTHORITIES "TRUE GUARANTEES" FOR DEMOCRATIZATION AND SECURITY PRIOR TO ENDING THE ARMED STRUGGLE, THE PROTAGONISTS OF THE DIALOGUE SEEMED SATISFIED AT THE END OF THE MEETING. MONSIGNOR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ, SAN SALVADOR AUXILIARY BISHOP AND MEDIATOR IN THE TALKS, TOLD ACAN - EFE THAT LAST NIGHT'S MEETING WAS "DIFFICULT YET FRUITFUL" AFTER COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS VISITED THE CONVENT SITE OF THE MEETING. ARIAS MET FOR A WHILE ON 17 OCTOBER WITH THE DELEGATION MEMBERS AND THE MEDIATORS AT THE SAINT CLARE CONVENT, WHERE THE DIALOGUE IS TAKING PLACE, AND SUCCEEDED IN UNBLOCKING THE MEETING, WHICH HAD BEEN BOGGED DOWN IN THE MORNING, ACCORDING TO ROSA CHAVEZ. ARIAS, WHO WAS AWARDED THE 1987 NOBEL PRIZE FOR HIS PEACE EFFORTS IN CENTRAL AMERICA, SAID WHILE LEAVING THE MEETING WITH THE NEGOTIATORS AND MEDIATORS ON 17 OCTOBER THAT HE WAS MOVED TO INTERVENE BECAUSE HE WANTED TO "ENCOURAGE THE SIDES TO KEEP NEGOTIATING." ARIAS STRESSED THE DIFFICULTY IN FINDING A RAPID SOLUTION FOR A PROBLEM OF VIOLENCE THAT HAS LASTED 10 YEARS AND KILLED MORE THAN 70,000 PEOPLE. HE POINTED OUT THAT "THERE IS STILL WILLINGNESS TO SEEK PEACEFUL WAYS TO END THIS BLOODY CONFRONTATION." ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE, BOTH SIDES ARE WILLING TO "GO OVER SOME IDEAS," PRESENTED IN THIS MEETING, AND KEEP ELABORATING ON THEM IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SALVADORAN SITUATION. REGARDING THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES, WHICH WAS MENTIONED AS THE MAIN POINT EARLY IN THE MEETING BUT HAS NOT YET BEEN APPROVED BECAUSE OF A DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SIDES, AN ACCORD WAS FINALLY REACHED TO "CLARIFY" THE MEANING OF THE PHRASE. ACCORDING TO FMLN SPOKESMAN JESUS ROJAS, THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATION HAS CONTINUED TO INDICATE THAT "IT HAS NO DECISIONMAKING ABILITY" AND THIS HAS CAUSED UNCERTAINTY IN THE NEGOTIATIONS. CESAR MARTI, ANOTHER FMLN MEMBER, SAID "SUBSTANTIAL ACCORDS" HAVE NOT BEEN ANTICIPATED, BUT THE "THE DIALOGUE HAS BEEN SAVED." ROSA CHAVEZ SAID THE MEETING, THE SECOND SINCE DIRECT CONTACTS WERE RESUMED IN MEXICO CITY IN SEPTEMBER ENDS TODAY. TODAY IT WILL BE ANNOUNCED WHERE AND WHEN THE 3D MEETING WILL BE HELD, PERHAPS IN CARACAS, ALTHOUGH THE REBELS INSIST THAT THE MEETING SITE SHOULD BE SAN SALVADOR.
DEV-MUC3-0584	LA PAZ, 18 OCT 89 -- PERU HAS GIVEN BOLIVIA FREE ZONES IN TWO PERUVIAN PORTS TO FACILITATE THAT COUNTRY'S ACCESS TO THE SEA. BOLIVIA LOST ITS PACIFIC COASTLINE IN A WAR AGAINST CHILE IN 1879. THIS AGREEMENT WAS REACHED DURING A MEETING BETWEEN PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA AND BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA ON BOARD A SHIP ANCHORED ON THE HIGHEST LAKE IN THE WORLD, LAKA TITICACA. "IT HAS BEEN A FRUITFUL MEETING BECAUSE WE AGREED ON SEVERAL ISSUES THAT GO BEYOND THE RHETORIC OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS," THE PERUVIAN CHIEF OF STATE SAID AFTER THE SESSION. "WE MET TO DEFINITIVELY IMPLEMENT AN OLD PERUVIAN OFFERING," GARCIA ADDED. ACCORDING TO THE JOINT DECLARATION THAT WAS RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT, THE FREE ZONES ARE LOCATED IN THE PORTS OF MATARANI AND ILO, IN SOUTHERN PERU, IN KEEPING WITH AN OFFER MADE BY THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT IN 1979. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT BOLIVIA HAS GAINED ACCESS TO FREE ZONES IN PERUVIAN PORTS. THE ONLY FREE PORT BOLIVIA PREVIOUSLY HAD ACCESS TO WAS THE CHILEAN PORT OF IQUIQUE. AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT THE BOLIVIAN FREE ZONE LOCATIONS AREAS, AND OPERATIONS SYSTEMS IN PERUVIAN PORTS WILL BE DEFINED DURING A MEETING OF BOLIVIAN AND PERUVIAN EXPERTS, WHO MUST PREPARE PROPOSALS WITHIN 60 DAYS. THE TWO PRESIDENTS DECIDED TO CREATE A MARITIME TRANSPORTATION COMPANY WITH TWO COMPANIES FROM EACH COUNTRY. THE PRESIDENTS INSTRUCTED THEIR DECLARATION, THE CHIEFS OF STATE DECIDED THAT PERUVIAN LEAD AND SILVER CONCENTRATE WILL BE PROCESSED IN BOLIVIAN METAL PLANTS. THEY ALSO DECIDED TO CREATE A BINATIONAL COMPANY TO MARKET MINERALS. THE TWO PRESIDENTS, THE COMMUNIQUE STATES, "EXPRESSED THEIR WILL TO PROMOTE THE CREATION IN THE FUTURE OF A BINATIONAL MINISTRY FOR THE COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF THE HIGH PLATEAU REGION SHARED BY THE TWO COUNTRIES." GARCIA AND PAZ ZAMORA RATIFIED "THEIR CONVICTION TO CARRY OUT BILATERAL TRADE WITHIN THE ANDEAN INTEGRATION PROGRAM," AND THE PERUVIAN ADMINISTRATION PROMISED TO GRANT BOLIVIA FACILITIES "TO ENCOURAGE TRADE OF BOLIVIAN AGRICULTURE AND AGRO-INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS." ON THE SUBJECT OF DRUG TRAFFICKING, THE TWO PRESIDENTS "REITERATED THEIR POLITICAL WILL" TO COORDINATE ACTIONS AGAINST ILLEGAL DRUG TRAFFICKING, ACCORDING TO THE COMMITMENT ASSUMED ON 10 OCTOBER BY GARCIA, PAZ ZAMORA, AND COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO IN THE PERUVIAN CITY OF ICA. BOLIVIA AND PERU ARE TWO OF THE WORLD'S MAIN PRODUCERS OF COCA LEAVES, THE RAW MATERIAL FOR MAKING COCAINE, OF WHICH 80 PERCENT IS PROCESSED IN COLOMBIAN LABORATORIES. THE TWO CHIEFS OF STATE ALSO DECIDED TO "REVIEW AND MODERNIZE" PUBLIC TRANSIT BETWEEN THEIR TWO COUNTRIES "IN KEEPING WITH HISTORICAL, GEOGRAPHIC, AND ECONOMIC RELATIONS" BETWEEN BOLIVIA AND PERU. IN A REMARKABLE SIDELIGHT, PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA DECIDED TO RENAME THE PERUVIAN SHIP "OLLANATA," WHERE THE MEETING TOOK PLACE, THE "GREAT MARSHAL ANDRES DE SANTA CRUZ," AFTER THE FIFTH BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT AND SPONSOR OF THE PERUVIAN- BOLIVIAN CONFEDERATION. ONE OF THE AGREEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE 18-POINT FINAL DECLARATION STATES THAT BOLIVIA WILL BE ABLE TO SEND NAVY OFFICERS WITH THE NEXT PERUVIAN MISSION TO ANTARCTICA. THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT WAS HELD ON THE WATERS OF LAKE TITICACA, 3,800 METERS ABOVE SEA LEVEL. A BOMB EXPLODED TODAY AT DAWN IN THE PERUVIAN TOWN OF YUNGUYO, NEAR THE LAKE, VERY NEAR WHERE THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT WAS TO TAKE PLACE. ALTHOUGH THE EXPLOSION DID NOT CAUSE ANY CASUALTIES, THE LOCAL POLICE STATION DID SUSTAIN SOME PROPERTY DAMAGE.
DEV-MUC3-0585	LA PAZ, 18 OCT 89 -- PERU HAS GIVEN BOLIVIA FREE ZONES IN TWO PERUVIAN PORTS TO FACILITATE THAT COUNTRY'S ACCESS TO THE SEA.

DEV-MUC3-0586	BOGOTA, 19 OCT 89 -- SPECIAL SECURITY MEASURES WERE ADOPTED AT THE CONGRESS TODAY. ONLY PARLIAMENTARIANS, JOURNALISTS, AND EMPLOYEES ARE ALLOWED TO ENTER THE BUILDING. THE GENERAL PUBLIC HAS BEEN BANNED. THESE MEASURES WERE IMPLEMENTED AFTER A PAID ASSASSIN WAS KILLED RIGHT IN BOLIVAR SQUARE BY A GRENADE HE WAS TRYING TO THROW AT THE CONGRESS BUILDING. THE ABORTED ACTION BY THE TERRORIST ON 18 OCTOBER FORCED THE AUTHORITIES TO REINFORCE SECURITY AT THE CONGRESS. HOWEVER, BOLIVAR SQUARE WAS POORLY PATROLLED. SEVERAL ONLOOKERS ARRIVED AT THE SQUARE EARLY THIS MORNING TO SEE WHERE THE TERRORIST WAS KILLED WHEN THE GRENADE EXPLODED. THOSE WHO CANNOT SHOW PROPER IDENTITY CARDS WILL NOT BE ADMITTED. DOES THIS INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES AND SENATORS? YES, ANYONE WHO HAS LEGITIMATE BUSINESS HERE AT THE CONGRESS. THE MEASURES CAUSED VARIOUS REACTIONS AND ANGERED SOME CONGRESSMEN. WHY WAS THIS SENATOR NOT ADMITTED? BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO BE SEARCHED, AS EVERYBODY MUST BE. SEARCHING CONGRESSMEN IS NOT VERY NICE, BUT IT WOULD BE WORSE IF ONE WERE KILLED. EMPLOYEES DID NOT ESCAPE THE CHECK EITHER. THE POLICE EVEN CORDONED OFF THE OUTSIDE AREAS NEAR WHERE THE COMMISSIONS WORK.
DEV-MUC3-0587	SAN SALVADOR, 20 OCT 89 -- ...WHICH IS THE OVERALL RESULT, BUT ALSO ANALYZED THE MANNER IN WHICH THIS MEETING WAS HELD BECAUSE WE BELIEVE, AND WE HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED, THAT THE PEOPLE MUST BE INFORMED, THE PEOPLE MUST KNOW THE TRUTH. INITIALLY, THIS SECOND MEETING WITH THE FMLN IS A FOLLOWUP TO THE MEXICO ACCORD IN SEPTEMBER. WE WANT TO BEGIN BY BRIEFLY EXPLAINING WHAT THE MEXICO ACCORD WAS, PARTICULARLY WHAT WE AGREED TO DISCUSS IN THE MEETING IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA. WE HAVE HERE THE TEXT OF THE MEXICO ACCORD, AND IN THE CHAPTER CONCERNING THE NEXT MEETING IT SAYS: THE TOPIC OF DISCUSSION WILL BE THE END OF HOSTILITIES, BASED ON PROPOSALS BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN . IN VIEW OF THE MEXICO ACCORD, OUR DELEGATION BEGAN TO WORK ON A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD MAKE EVERY POSSIBLE EFFORT TO OUTLINE WHAT COULD BE AN END TO HOSTILITIES. WHY HAVE WE INSISTED ON THIS TOPIC? BECAUSE WE WANT AN END TO VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY, THE END OF WEAPONS FIRING, THE END OF BOMB EXPLOSIONS, THE END OF MINES MUTILATING THE LITTLE HANDS AND FEET OF CHILDREN IN RURAL AREAS. WE WANT TO SEE AN END TO THE DESTRUCTION OF EL SALVADOR, AND AN ATMOSPHERE OF CORDIALITY AND TRANQUILITY WITH GREATER POSSIBILITIES FOR THE DIALOGUE PROCESS. THAT IS THE PHILOSPHY, BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AND EACH ONE OF YOU AS PART OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, DO NOT DESERVE THIS VIOLENT SITUATION, THIS HOSTILE SITUATION GENERATED BY THE ARMED GROUPS OF THE FMLN. THE PROPOSAL IS ALSO BASED ON THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PLAN, ESQUIPULAS II, AND THE SUBSEQUENT AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE FIVE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS. I WOULD LIKE TO RECALL THE TELA AGREEMENT, THE LAST AGREEMENT. IN PART III, THE AGREEMENT READS AS FOLLOWS: THE FMLN IS STRONGLY URGED TO END HOSTILITIES IN AN IMMEDIATE AND EFFECTIVE MANNER TO HOLD A DIALOGUE THAT WILL LEAD TO GIVING UP THE ARMED STRUGGLE; THE FMLN MEMBERS WILL RETURN TO DEMOCRATIC LIFE.
DEV-MUC3-0588	CLANDESTINE, 19 OCT 89 -- RUBEN ZAMORA, LEADER OF THE POPULAR SOCIAL CHRISTIAN MOVEMENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE, WAS UNHARMED FOLLOWING A TERRORIST ATTACK. ZAMORA SAID THE COUNTRY IS SUFFERING FROM A WAVE OF VIOLENCE LAUNCHED BY GROUPS THAT DO NOT WANT THE NEGOTIATIONS TO SUCCEED. HE ALSO SAID THERE ARE ULTRARIGHTIST GROUPS THAT DO NOT SEEK A NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THEIR INTERESTS WILL BE HARMED, AND ADDED THAT THERE ARE GROUPS WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES AND ARENA THAT DO NOT WANT THE NEGOTIATIONS. HE SAID THESE GROUPS TEND TO REACT WITH INCREASED VIOLENCE.
DEV-MUC3-0589	NO CITY , 20 OCT 89 -- THE FMLN HAS DONE NOTHING BUT INSIST ON AN IMMEDIATE ANSWER TO ALL OF THIS. LOGICALLY, I CANNOT SAY THAT THEIR'S IS A SERIOUS POSITION BECAUSE WHEN A NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS ARE PUT FORWARD, A PERIOD OF TIME IS REQUIRED TO ANALYZE THEM. HOWEVER, THE FMLN IMMEDIATELY REJECTED THE GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSAL, SAYING THAT IT WOULD NOT ACCEPT IT. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? THAT THE FMLN NO LONGER WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE END OF THE HOSTILITIES, BUT WANTS TO INTRODUCE NEW TOPICS AT THE SAN JOSE MEETING. HOWEVER, DESPITE THE FMLN'S POSITION, AND ALTHOUGH THERE HAS NOT BEEN AN IN-DEPTH STUDY OF ALL THE DOCUMENTS, ONE CAN SEE AT FIRST GLANCE THAT THE PROPOSALS THEY HAVE PUT FORWARD ARE TOTALLY ABSURD. I WILL CITE AN EXAMPLE: YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT THE FMLN HAS ADMITTED TO BEING UNABLE TO MAINTAIN A POSITION, THAT IF IT ATTEMPTS TO OCCUPY A TOWN, IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS THE ARMED FORCES DRIVE IT OUT. IT CANNOT MAINTAIN A POSITION IN THE COUNTRY. NEVERTHELESS, THE FMLN PROPOSAL ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH TERRITORIAL LIMITS WITH THE GOVERNMENT. WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT THE FMLN EXISTS AND IS A REALITY, I BELIEVE THAT REALITY HAS A DIMENSION, A SIZE. THE RESULTS OF THE PAST ELECTIONS, THE RESULTS OF SOMETHING OVER 3 PERCENT , INDICATE THAT THE FMLN IS A REALITY BUT A VERY SMALL ONE, AND THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO FORCE A GOVERNMENT AND A PEOPLE TO VIOLATE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM. MEANWHILE, THE FMLN HAS COME UP WITH THE TOTALLY ABSURD NOTION THAT THE GOVERNMENT MUST DISMISS THE ENTIRE CLASS OF '66, THE DEFENSE MINISTER, AND THE COMMANDER OF THE AIR FORCE. THAT IS TOTALLY ABSURD, IT IS A RIDICULOUS POSITION THAT DOES NOT TRULY SHOW ANY INTENTION TO MOVEMENT TOWARD PEACE. THE FMLN PROPOSAL ALSO CALLS FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO INSTRUCT THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY TO CHANGE ALL OF THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES. THESE, SALVADORAN FRIENDS, ARE TOTALLY ABSURD POSITIONS; ALTHOUGH THESE ARE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT, THEIR PREVIOUS POSITIONS ARE EVER PRESENT. THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT AT ANY TIME VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION, IT WILL NEVER QUESTION THE SACRIFICES THAT YOU AND ALL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE MADE DURING THESE LONG YEARS IN ORDER TO GRADUALLY STRENGTHEN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, WHICH MAY NOT BE PERFECT -- AND WE WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS DIFFERENT WAYS OF PERFECTING IT -- BUT WE WILL NEVER SELL IT OR SACRIFICE IT, ESPECIALLY UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH, BY ALL MEANS, ARE ABSURD. WHAT IS WORSE, HOWEVER, IS THAT ALONG WITH THE ATTITUDE THE FMLN HAS DISPLAYED IN COSTA RICA, ALONG WITH ITS REJECTION OF EVERYTHING THE GOVERNMENT SAYS, ITS ATTEMPTS TO MODIFY THE AGENDA WE HAD AGREED UPON IN MEXICO, ITS EFFORTS TO INTRODUCE A SERIES OF DOCUMENTS, AND ITS DEMAND FOR IMMEDIATE ANSWERS, IT HAS INITIATED A STRATEGY OF MURDERS HERE IN EL SALVADOR. EVERYONE HAS NOTICED; THEY MURDERED A REPORTER'S WIFE AND SON. WHY? BECAUSE THEY HAD A RELATIVE IN THE ARMED FORCES. THEY HAVE MURDERED AN INNOCENT YOUNG GIRL, AT A SAFE DISTANCE, IN A COWARDLY MANNER, ONLY BECAUSE SHE WAS A RELATIVE OF AN ARMED FORCES MEMBER. YESTERDAY THEY ATTEMPTED TO MURDER A FORMER MILITARY MAN WHO ALSO HAS A RELATIVE IN THE ARMED FORCES. WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS MEAN? THAT THE FMLN INTENDS TO TALK OVER THERE AND TO MAKE AN ENTIRE CASE OUT OF ITS DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS, WHILE MURDERING PEOPLE AND VIOLATING THE HUMAN RIGHTS THEY CLAIM TO BE DEFENDING, ON A DAILY BASIS. ALL OF THESE FMLN ATTITUDES FORCE US TO DIALOGUE, AND AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING, I MUST BE COMPLETELY CLEAR AND OPEN. I MUST TELL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE THE TRUTH. I BELIEVE THAT SO FAR THE FMLN HAS NOT DISPLAYED THE POLITICAL RESOLVE TO ACHIEVE PEACE. FIRST OF ALL, THE FMLN DOES NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT ENDING THE CONFLICT, IT DOES NOT WANT TO GIVE THE ENTIRE COUNTRY -- YOU AND I, MY DEAR VIEWERS -- THE OPPORTUNITY TO STOP LIVING IN THIS WHIRLPOOL OF VIOLENCE, TO LIVE IN PEACE, AND TO ALLOW THE PROCESS TO PROGRESS IN THE SEARCH FOR SOLUTIONS THAT WILL GRADUALLY GIVE US FIRM AND LASTING PEACE, WITHIN AN ATMOSPHERE OF TRANQUILITY. THE FMLN'S ATTITUDE IS ONE OF PROVOCATION. IT WANTS TO PROVOKE THE GOVERNMENT INTO GETTING UP FROM THE DIALOGUE TABLE; IT HAS TRIED TO ANGER THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION BY INSULTING THEM. ALL IN ALL, THE FMLN IS TRYING TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO DESIST. WHY ARE THEY SEEKING THIS? BECAUSE ALL THEY WANT IS A LITTLE MORE IMAGE, THE IMAGE THAT THEY HAVE COMPLETELY LOST BECAUSE THEIR SPACES HAVE BEEN CLOSED. NO ONE IN THE WORLD WILL CONTINUE TO JUSTIFY AN ARMED STRUGGLE. THAT IS A THING OF THE PAST.
DEV-MUC3-0590	NO CITY , 20 OCT 89 -- PRESIDENT ARIAS WAS RIGHT WHEN HE SAID THAT PERHAPS FIDEL CASTRO IS THE ONLY ONE WHO INSISTS ON THE SITUATION -- AND WHO SEEMS TO HAVE NOT YET RETURNED FROM THE SIERRA MAESTRA WHERE HE WAS IN 1959. THAT SEEMS TO BE THE ATTITUDE OF THE FMLN LEADERS. WHAT ELSE DO THE ARMED FORCES, I MEAN , DOES THE FMLN WANT WITH ALL THESE ABSURD PROPOSALS AND ATTITUDES? IT IS SEEKING TO DIVIDE THE ARMED FORCES. IT IS SEEKING TO ISOLATE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC. IT WANTS TO THE GOVERNMENT IMAGE, WHICH HAS BEEN CONSOLIDATED LITTLE BY LITTLE AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, BECAUSE WE ARE SHOWING TO THE WORLD THAT THERE IS A DEMOCRACY HERE, THAT A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IS BEING CONSOLIDATED, AND THAT THE FORCES THAT ALREADY EXIST WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM ARE FORCES THAT TRULY WANT AND SEEK PEACE, RATHER THAN FORCES THAT ASSASSINATE AND CAUSE DESTRUCTION. THEREFORE, WE CAN NO LONGER THINK AT THIS MOMENT, THAT THE FMLN HAS ONLY VIEWED THE DIALOGUE FROM A STRATEGIC POINT OF VIEW. HOWEVER, WE WANT TO SAY SOMETHING. ALL THIS STRATEGY SHOULD NOT CONFUSE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. WE MUST BE CALM BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC WILL NOT GIVE AN INCH AND WILL CONTINUE, THROUGH RATIONAL MEANS, TO STRUGGLE AND SEARCH FOR PEACE, TO WHICH YOU AND ALL SALVADORANS ARE ENTITLED. WE ARE NOT GOING TO FALL INTO THE TRAPS THE FMLN IS TRYING TO PUT BEFORE US. HOWEVER, AT THIS MOMENT, WHAT WE SHOULD SEE IS WHO WANTS PEACE AND WHO DOES NOT WANT TO SEARCH FOR PEACE. UP TO THIS MOMENT, THE FMLN HAS GIVEN NO EVIDENCE IT WANTS TO ATTAIN PEACE AND TRANQUILITY FOR YOU, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. NEVERTHELESS, WE MUST NOT BE PESSIMISTIC. ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT ONE CANNOT SAY, FOR PROPAGANDA PURPOSES, THAT OUTSTANDING RESULTS WERE OBTAINED AT THE MEETING IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, SOME RESULTS WERE ATTAINED. THE DIALOGUE PROCESS WILL CONTINUE AND THAT SHOULD ELIMINATE ALL TRACES OF PESSIMISM. WE MUST THINK THAT THE DIALOGUE PROCESS THAT BEGAN IN MEXICO WAS NOT BROKEN IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, AND THAT THIS PROCESS WILL CONTINUE NEXT MONTH IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA. THE ISSUE AGAIN WILL BE CEASING HOSTILITIES. WE ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE AWARE OF THE VARIOUS POSITIONS, AND THERE IS LESS ROOM TO PLAY STRATEGIC GAMES WITH THE DIALOGUE PROCESS. THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO DISCUSS ANY SUBJECT IN THIS DIALOGUE PROCESS. HOWEVER, WE MUST DO THIS IN AN ORDERLY MANNER. WHEN WE REACH AN AGREEMENT, SUCH AGREEMENTS MUST BE RESPECTED. THAT IS THE ATTITUDE THAT SHOULD PREVAIL IF THERE IS A TRUE POLITICAL DESIRE TO ACHIEVE PEACE. THEREFORE, ONCE AGAIN I WANT TO CONCLUDE MY MESSAGE BY MAKING AN APPEAL FOR UNITY. WE MUST BE UNITED FOR PEACE. ALL SECTORS -- POLITICAL, LABOR, RELIGIOUS, AND BUSINESS -- MUST DEMAND THAT THE FMLN SHOW A TRUE DESIRE TO ACHIEVE PEACE. WE MUST DEMAND THAT THE FMLN STOP TRYING TO USE PEACE IN EL SALVADOR FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES. IF THE FMLN TRULY WANTS PEACE, WHY DOES IT CONTINUE TO SMUGGLE WEAPONS -- PROBABLY FROM NICARAGUA -- INTO EL SALVADOR. TODAY, A TRUCK FROM NICARAGUA LOADED WITH WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES FOR THE FMLN WAS CONFISCATED AT THE BORDER WITH HONDURAS. THIS SHOWS THAT THE FMLN IS NOT YET SERIOUSLY SEARCHING FOR PEACE IN EL SALVADOR. HOWEVER, THE UNITY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SHOULD FORCE THE FMLN TO SEARCH FOR PEACE. THE UNITY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SHOULD CLOSE POLITICAL SPACE SO THE WILL STOP ITS STRATEGIC GAMES. ALL OF US, UNITED, SHOULD DEMAND THAT THE FMLN TAKE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS SERIOUSLY, EQUALLY AS SERIOUSLY AS THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT. WE FIRMLY BELIEVE WE MUST SEARCH THROUGH PEACEFUL MEANS TO HAVE PEACE AND CALM IN EL SALVADOR. SALVADORAN BROTHERS, LET US NOT DISMAY. WE HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE EXCESSIVE ENTHUSIASM. THIS IS NOT AN EASY PROBLEM, THERE WILL BE OBSTACLES, IT IS A DIFFICULT PROBLEM. HOWEVER, WE HAVE ALWAYS SAID YOU CAN BE SURE THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT IS WORKING FOR PEACE AND WILL NOT CEASE TO WORK FOR PEACE. MAY GOD BLESS YOU. GOOD EVENING.
DEV-MUC3-0591	SAN SALVADOR, 20 OCT 89 -- THIS HAS REALLY BEEN AN AGREEMENT THAT REFLECTS THE GOVERNMENT'S INTERESTS, AS WELL AS THE INTERESTS OF THE TERRORIST FRONT. IN THIS RESPECT, WE AGREE WITH THE TEXT OF THE SAN JOSE ACCORD. AT A NEWS CONFERENCE HELD YESTERDAY AT THE UND, THE NATIONALIST DEMOCRATIC UNION, IT WAS SAID THAT THE PARTICIPATION OF TWO U.S. ADVISERS AND ONE U.S. MILITARY ADVISER PREVENTED GREATER PROGRESS IN THE DIALOGUE. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT? WE MUST NEVER FORGET THAT TERRORISTS TRY TO CONFUSE AND TRY TO FOSTER AN ATTITUDE AND ACTIONS IN THE PEOPLE SOLELY TO JUSTIFY THEMSELVES. AT NO TIME WAS THE MILITARY DELEGATION, WHICH PARTICIPATED AS ADVISERS IN THE DIALOGUE, ABLE TO INFLUENCE THE DECISIONS OF THE DIALOGUE COMMISSION. THEIR ROLE AS ADVISERS ENABLED THEM TO GIVE ADVICE TO THE DIALOGUE COMMISSION, BUT IT IS ABSURD TO THINK THAT THE PRESENCE OF OUR TWO MILITARY ADVISERS AND OTHER ADVISERS PREVENTED REAL AND COMPLEX POSITIONS FROM BEING TAKEN AT THAT MEETING. THERE IS NO U.S. ADVISER... MOREOVER, WE CANNOT.... NO U.S. ADVISER ACCOMPANIED OUR DELEGATION. IF THERE WAS ONE, HE WENT STRICTLY ON HIS OWN. YOUR QUESTION, THEREFORE, IS IMPORTANT, BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO TELL YOU THAT THE SALVADORAN MILITARY DELEGATION NEVER HAMPERED THE WORK OF THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATION DURING THE TALKS. THE NONGOVERNMENT HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION PRESENTED THE RELATIVES OF TORTURED AND CAPTURED PERSONS. IT ACCUSED 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE COMMANDER FRANCISCO ELENA FUENTES AND OTHER OFFICERS OF HAVING TIES TO THE DEATH SQUADS. I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THESE KINDS OF REPORTS OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS. FRIENDS -- AND HERE I AM APPEALING TO MY FRIENDS -- LET US NOT ALLOW THE TERRORISTS' DESPERATE ACTIONS TO CONFUSE AND CONVEY A FALSE MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE. THE FACT IS THAT THIS IS PART OF THE STRATEGY OF DECEIT, LIES, AND DISRESPECT FOR THE PEOPLE AND THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS IMPLEMENTED BY THE TERRORISTS. LET ME REPEAT THAT THIS IS PART OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED STRATEGY. WE MUST NOT BE DECEIVED. WE KNOW FULL WELL WHO THE PERSONS ARE WHO ARE TRYING TO SOW MISTRUST AND CONFUSION AMONG CIVILIANS. WE ARE A RESPONSIBLE, SERIOUS, AND FORMAL INSTITUTION. IT IS UP TO US TO INVESTIGATE ALL THESE VIOLENT INCIDENTS AND DEATHS. WE WILL DO OUR DUTY BY CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION.
DEV-MUC3-0592	BOGOTA, 20 OCT 89 -- TODAY, WE HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT A VERY PAINFUL EVENT THAT OCCURRED IN BARRANQUILLA. BARRANQUILLA RESIDENTS ARE VERY CONCERNED TONIGHT FOLLOWING THIS AFTERNOON'S CAR BOMB EXPLOSION, WHICH WOUNDED AT LEAST 10 PERSONS AND CAUSED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE. THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED WHEN A CAR FILLED WITH TOURISTS WAS PARKED IN FRONT OF THE ROYAL HOTEL. FORTUNATELY, THERE WERE NO FATALITIES. OFFICIALS CAPTURED ONE OF THE TERRORISTS; HIS NAME IS JOSE RAMIREZ, AGED 24, AND HE IS FROM ARMENIA. ANOTHER TERRORIST WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE CAR BOMBING IS STILL AT LARGE.
DEV-MUC3-0593	BOGOTA, 20 OCT 89 -- AUTHORITIES CONTINUE TO DEAL SUCCESSFUL BLOWS AGAINST TERRORISM. CAPTURED TODAY WERE TWO EXTRADITABLES AND ONE BOMB PLANTER, WHICH IS WHAT PEOPLE HERE ARE CALLING THESE TERRORISTS. THE TERRORIST, WHO GIVES HIS NAME AS GONZALO PINZON LAGOS, 24, WAS CAPTURED BY DIJIN . HE CONFESSED TO PARTICIPATING IN BOMB ATTACKS EARLY THIS MONTH AGAINST THE ENERGY TOWERS LOCATED AT ROJAS AVENUE AND 75TH STREET AND IN CAFAN SARSAMORA. A TERRORIST WORKING FOR THE JOHN BOLANOS LOPEZ GANG WAS KILLED IN THIS ATTACK. RICARDO BOLANOS RODRIGUEZ, THE GANG LEADER'S FATHER, WAS ALSO ARRESTED. HE IS ACCUSED OF RECRUITING TERRORISTS. THIS MORNING, HE WAS GOING TO PUT A BOMB AT THE AZULEJOS CORONA STORE, ALONG THE MEDELLIN SPEEDWAY. AN EXTRADITABLE WAS CAPTURED BY THE POLICE WHILE HE WAS IN THE CERREJON INSTALLATIONS, IN THE TOWN OF MAICAO, GUAJIRA INTENDANCY. HE COMES FROM BARRANQUILLA AND IS IDENTIFIED AS ROBERT JAMIS SOCOLOGUISQUI SALA. THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA IS REQUESTING HIS EXTRADITION, BUT MEANWHILE HE WILL REMAIN AT DIJIN INSTALLATIONS.
DEV-MUC3-0594	LONDON , 19 OCT 89 -- BRITAIN AND ARGENTINA TODAY AGREED TO RESUME THEIR CONSULAR RELATIONS AND DIRECT AIR AND SEA LINKS SEVERED DURING THEIR WAR OVER SOVEREIGNTY OF THE MALVINAS ISLANDS SEVEN YEARS AGO. AFTER THREE DAYS OF SUBSTANTIVE TALKS IN MADRID, THE TWO COUNTRIES AGREED "TO LIFT ALL REMAINING RESTRICTIONS" ON TRADE AND FINANCIAL EXCHANGES, SAID A JOINT COMMUNIQUE ISSUED HERE TODAY. THEY ALSO EXPRESSED A WISH TO NORMALIZE THEIR TIES "WITH A VIEW TO RESUMING DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS," IT SAID. THE DISCUSSIONS WERE HELD BETWEEN BRITISH NEGOTIATOR CRISPIN TICKELL, BRITAIN'S AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS, AND VETERAN ARGENTINE DIPLOMAT LUCIO GARCIA DE SOLAR. THE TALKS, ARRANGED AFTER THE TWO SPECIAL ENVOYS MET IN NEW YORK IN AUGUST, WERE EXTENDED A DAY BEYOND ITS TWO-DAY SCHEDULE. THEY AGREED TO HOLD FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS TO STRIVE FOR THE RESUMPTION OF THE TWO COUNTRIES' DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BROKEN DURING THE 1982 MALVINAS WAR. THE NEXT SUBSTANTIVE MEETING WILL BE HELD ON FEBRUARY 14-15, 1990. DURING THE MADRID TALKS, THE TWO COUNTRIES PUT ASIDE THE CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE OF SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE SOUTH ATLANTIC ISLANDS, WHICH BLOCKED THEIR FIRST RECONCILIATION ATTEMPT IN BERN, SWITZERLAND, IN 1984. THE COMMUNIQUE SAID THAT THE TALKS ALLOWED BOTH SIDES TO HOLD THEIR RESPECTIVE POSITIONS ON THE ISSUE OF SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE ISLANDS AND THAT NOTHING OF THEIR AGREEMENT COULD BE INTERPRETED AS A CHANGE IN THEIR POSITIONS. AS REGARDS FISHERIES, THE COMMUNIQUE SAID, BOTH DELEGATIONS HAD DIFFERENT POSITIONS BUT AGREED "TO SET UP A WORKING GROUP WITH A VIEW TO MAKING PROPOSALS" TO BE SUBMITTED TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS. ARGENTINA HOPES FOR THE LIFTING OF THE 150-MILE EXCLUSIVE ZONE AROUND THE MALVINAS ISLANDS IMPOSED BY BRITAIN AFTER THE 10-WEEK WAR, WHICH KILLED MORE THAN 1,000 PEOPLE. A BRITISH TRADE MISSION WILL VISIT ARGENTINA FROM NOVEMBER 27 TO DECEMBER 1, THIS YEAR, AND A NEW CULTURAL AGREEMENT COULD BE EXPECTED AS NORMALIZATION ADVANCED FURTHER, ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENT. LINKS AND CONTACTS BETWEEN THE FALKLANDS AND THE CONTINENTAL MAINLAND WOULD BE DEVELOPED AS BENEFICIAL. BRITAIN ALSO AGREED TO HELP ARGENTINA ESTABLISH ITS COOPERATIVE LINKS WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY, WHICH HAS REJECTED COMMERCIAL TIES WITH THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY BECAUSE OF ITS UNNORMALIZED RELATIONS WITH BRITAIN. BRITAIN IS ONE OF THE 12 MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY. DESCRIBING THE AGREEMENT AS REMARKABLE, TICKELL, THE BRITISH CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, SAID: "WE HAVE TAKEN A VERY LARGE STEP TOWARDS DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS ... WE ARE NOT THERE YET." ARGENTINE NEGOTIATOR DEL SOLAR EXPRESSED OPTIMISM FOR THE RESUMPTION OF FULL DIPLOMATIC TIES AND SAID: "MY IMPRESSION IS THAT THIS WILL NOT BE TOO LONG." THE ANGLO-ARGENTINE RAPPROCHEMENT WAS INITIATED BY ARGENTINA'S PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM, WHO TOOK OFFICE IN JULY. MENEM SAID ON THE SECOND DAY AFTER HIS INAUGURATION THAT TALKS COULD BE RESUMED ON RESTORATION OF THE TWO COUNTRIES' DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITHOUT DISCUSSING SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE MALVINAS ISLANDS. HE VOICED THE HOPE THAT THE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS COULD RESUME BY CHRISTMAS, A TIMETABLE THAT BRITAIN SAID IS EXTREMELY AMBITIOUS. HOWEVER, OBSERVERS HERE SAID THE MADRID AGREEMENT HAS PAVED THE WAY FOR BRITAIN AND ARGENTINA TO TALK TO EACH OTHER WITHOUT TOUCHING THE THORNY ISSUE OF SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE ISLANDS. BY REACHING THE AGREEMENT, BRITAIN AND ARGENTINA HAVE TAKEN A STRIDE TOWARD RECONCILIATION, THEY SAID.
DEV-MUC3-0595	SAN SALVADOR, 20 OCT 89 -- COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, TODAY SAID THAT THE WEAPONS CONFISCATED BY HONDURAN TROOPS WERE SENT FROM NICARAGUA AND INTENDED FOR THE URBAN PONCE REFERRED TO THE RECENT SEIZURE OF WEAPONS FROM A VAN WITH A SALVADORAN LICENSE PLATE WHICH WERE SENT BY THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT VIA COSTA RICA TO THE FMLN. HE SAID THAT THE ARSENAL INCLUDED A LARGE QUANTITY OF EXPLOSIVES AND HIGH CALIBER WEAPONS THAT WERE HIDDEN IN SECRET COMPARTMENTS OF THE VAN, WHICH WAS CARRYING FURNITURE FOR A SALVADORAN FAMILY. THIS DEMONSTRATES ONCE MORE THAT THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT CONTINUES SUPPORTING THE FMLN STRUGGLE AND IS DIRECTLY SUPPORTING THE URBAN COMMANDOS, WHICH ARE THE FMLN DEATH SQUADS IN THIS CITY. THESE MANUALS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN NICARAGUA AND BEAR THE FMLN LETTERHEAD. THEY ARE INTENDED FOR THE URBAN COMMANDOS AND INCLUDE TACTICAL INSTRUCTIONS AS WELL AS DIRECTIONS ON HOW TO USE ARMS. IN ADDITION, COL PONCE SHOWED A DOCUMENT THAT WAS SEIZED AT EL TIGRE HILL, USULUTAN DEPARTMENT, ON 30 JULY, DEALING WITH MILITARY THEORY AND URBAN WAR WHICH, HE SAID, THE FMLN IS CARRYING OUT IN SAN SALVADOR. THE DOCUMENT SAYS THE FOLLOWING IN ONE OF ITS PARAGRAPHS: THE WAR AGAINST THE AUTHORITIES MUST BE TOTAL AND MUST REACH THEIR PROPERTIES, FAMILIES, HOMES, WORK PLACES, AND VACATION RETREATS. WE MUST ALWAYS GIVE PRIORITY TO EXECUTIONS, BUT HARASSMENT, PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE, ETC, ARE ALSO PART OF THIS POLICY AND MAY BE CARRIED OUT BY THE LESS EXPERIENCED ECHELONS TO DEVELOP EXPERIENCE IN USING WEAPONS. THIS SHOWS THAT THE CLAIM THAT WAS MADE BY THE TERRORIST RINGLEADERS IN COSTA RICA IS NOT VALID. IT IS NOT TRUE THAT THEY DISAGREE WITH THIS LINE. ACCORDING TO PONCE'S STATEMENTS, THE ACTIONS UNCOVERED BY MILITARY INTELLIGENCE ARE TOTALLY AT VARIANCE WITH THE TOPICS DISCUSSED AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLES IN MEXICO AND COSTA RICA, BECAUSE THEY TALK ABOUT REACHING PEACE BUT THEIR ACTIONS SHOW THE CONTRARY.
DEV-MUC3-0596	MANAGUA, 21 OCT 89 -- NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA DECREED A 3-DAY NATIONAL MOURNING PERIOD IN THE WAKE OF THE SAHSA BOEING 727 PLANE CRASH IN WHICH 65 NICARAGUANS WHERE AMONG THE PASSENGERS.

DEV-MUC3-0597	TEGUCIGALPA, 21 OCT 89 -- ACCORDING TO UNOFFICIAL REPORTS AT LEAST 80 PERCENT OF THE APPROXIMATELY 130 PASSENGERS WHO WERE KILLED IN TODAY'S CRASH OF A HONDURAN AIRLINE SASHA BOEING 727 WHICH OCCURRED IN SOUTHERN TEGUCIGALPA WERE FOREIGNERS.

THE BOEING 727 LEFT COSTA RICA AT 0600, MADE A STOPOVER IN MANAGUA, AND CRASHED AT APPROXIMATELY 0745 BEFORE LANDING IN TEGUCIGALPA, FROM WHERE IT WAS GOING TO FLY TO HOUSTON, TEXAS. IN NICARAGUA, DANIEL ORTEGA DECREED 3-DAYS OF MOURNING AND ANNOUNCED THAT FOUR AIRPLANES WERE GOING TO FLY THE RELATIVES OF THE VICTIMS TO HONDURAS TO BRING BACK THE REMAINS.
DEV-MUC3-0598	SAN SALVADOR, 21 OCT 89 -- THE ARSENAL CONFISCATED IN HONDURAS CONFIRMS THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT VIOLATION OF THE TELA AGREEMENTS. CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF SAID THE COMMUNISTS ARE NOT TO BE TRUSTED BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SERIOUSNESS AND GOODWILL OF OTHERS. COL PONCE EXPLAINED HOW THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES DISCOVERED THE COMING FROM NICARAGUA. HE SAID THE TRUCK WAS FIRST SENT TO COSTA RICA IN ORDER TO CONFUSE THE HONDURAN AUTHORITIES. THE CARGO SEEMED TO BE FURNITURE EARMARKED FOR A SALVADORAN BUSINESSMEN, PONCE SAID. THE WEAPONS WERE DISCOVERED BY A HONDURAN SOLDIER AT THE BORDER AREA KNOWN AS EL ESPINO, IN CHOLUTECA. THE SOLDIER SAID THE WEAPONS WERE DISCOVERED BY ACCIDENT WHEN HE LOOSENED A WELDED SECTION OF THE TRUCK WHICH REVEALED A SECRET COMPARTMENT IN THE VEHICLE. COL PONCE ADDED THAT WHEN THE SOLDIERS SEARCHED THE TRUCK THEY FOUND SEVERAL SOVIET MADE AK-47 RIFLES; UZI SUBMACHINEGUNS, RPG-7 ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 60 MM MORTARS, RADIO COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT, PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES, FRAGMENTATION GRENADES, CARTRIDGE CLIPS, WIRE AND ELECTRIC DETONATORS, DELAYED-ACTION FUSES, AND INSTRUCTION MANUALS FOR THE WEAPONS IN URBAN COMBAT. FINALLY, COL PONCE EMPHASIZED THAT THIS IS HOW THE NICARAGUAN COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT CONTINUES VIOLATING ITS OWN COMMITMENTS BY SENDING WEAPONS TO OUR COUNTRY SO REBELS CONTINUE KILLING OTHER SALVADORANS.
DEV-MUC3-0599	BUENOS AIRES, 19 OCT 89 -- AFTER MEETING WITH PRESIDENT MENEM, FORMER MONTONEROS CHIEFS FERNANDO VACA NARVAJA AND ROBERTO CIRILO PERDIA HAVE STATED THAT THEY WILL BECOME "LEADERS" OF THE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION MOVEMENT AND ENTIRELY SUPPORT THE JUSTICIALIST GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC PROGRAM. THE MEMBERS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY FACTION OF THE PERONIST MOVEMENT HAVE ASKED PRESIDENT MENEM TO PARDON MONTONEROS LEADER MARIO FIRMENICH, WHO IS CURRENTLY BEING HELD AT THE CASEROS PRISON. VACA NARVAJA AND PERDIA ALSO ANNOUNCEDS THE THEY WILL ASK FOR A MEETING WITH ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF GENERAL ISIDRO CACERES, PJ LEADER ANTONIO CAFIERO, AND TOP LEADERS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WITH THE GOAL OF "ACHIEVING NATIONAL RECONCILIATION." VACA NARVAJA AND PERDIA WENT TO GOVERNMENT HOUSE TODAY AT NOON TO THANK PRESIDENT MENEM FOR THEIR PARDON AND TO EXPRESS "OUR COMMITMENT TO DO WHATEVER POSSIBLE TO STRENGTHEN THE PROCESS OF RECONCILIATION AND NATIONAL UNITY." THIS REMARK WAS MADE BY VACA NARVAJA TO SOME 50 JOURNALISTS GATHERED IN THE PRESIDENTIAL PRESS ROOM. HE TOLD THE JOURNALISTS THAT PRESIDENT MENEM RECEIVED THEM AND TOLD THEM THAT THEY WILL ENJOY ALL THE RIGHTS GRANTED TO ARGENTINES. HE ALSO ASKED THEM TO JOIN THE PRODUCTIVE REVOLUTION. INTERIOR MINISTER EDUARDO BAUZA WAS ALSO PRESENT AT THE 40-MINUTE MEETING. DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE, THE RECENTLY PARDONED MONTONEROS LEADERS POINTED OUT THAT THEY ASKED THE PRESIDENT TO PARDON MARIO FIRMENICH. THEY IMPLICITY ADMITTED THAT THE MILITARY MEN WHO LED THE PROCESS OF NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION COULD BE RELEASED. VACA NARVAJA SAID IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION THAT THE MONTONEROS "HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT AT THE LUJAN BASILICA NATIONAL SANCTUARY," AND THAT "IT IS NOT POSSIBLE -- NOR IT IS CORRECT OR JUST -- TO CARRY OUT ARMED OR CLANDESTINE ACTIONS WHEN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS ARE FULLY EFFECTIVE." ASKED ABOUT THE MONEY COLLECTED IN THE KIDNAPPING OF IMPRESARIO JORGE BORN, ROBERTO PERDIA SAID THAT "THIS MATTER WAS NOT DISCUSSED" WITH PRESIDENT MENEM. "WE MAINTAIN OUR DECISION THAT THE FUNDS WILL BECOME AVAILABLE SO THAT THEY CAN BE USED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS TROUBLING OUR PEOPLE," PERDIA ADDED. PERDIA ALSO NOTED THAT "MOST OF THE PEOPLE HAVE SHOWN OBVIOUS SIGNS OF UNDERSTANDING THE PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE AND OF WORKING FOR THE FINAL PACIFICATION." ASKED IF THE MONEY OBTAINED FROM THE KIDNAPPING OF BORN WOULD BE RETURNED, PERDIA RESPONDED THAT "IT WILL BE RETURNED TO PEOPLE WHO CAN BEST USE IT; WE BELIEVE THAT NO ONE CAN REFUSE OR BLOCK THIS MONEY FROM BEING RETURNED TO ITS LEGITIMATE OWNERS, THE PEOPLE, WHO BUILT THE COUNTRY'S WEALTH WITH THEIR LABOR." REGARDING THE SUBJECT OF MISSING PERSONS AND IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION ON WHETHER THIS "WAS A CLOSED CASE," PERDIA EMPHASIZED THAT "IT IS NECESSARY TO THINK IN THE FUTURE ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF THOSE WHO ARE ALIVE AND TO BUILD THE COUNTRY WITHOUT FORGETTING THE PAST." PERDIA ALSO SADI THAT "PAST EVENTS MUST BE REGISTERED IN THE PEOPLE'S CONSCIENCE, IN THE PEOPLE'S MEMORY, SO THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL LEARN OUR GOOD AND EVIL EXPERIENCES." WHEN A CAMERAMEN FROM A FOREIGN TELEVISION STATION ASKED HIM WHEN THE MONTONEROS WOULD RETURN THEIR WEAPONS, PERDIA SAID THAT "WE HAVE NOT USED WEAPONS SINCE 1983" BECAUSE "WE HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT THERE IS NO ROOM FOR WEAPONS WHENEVER THERE ARE DEMOCRATIC WAYS." BUT THE CAMERAMEN LOUDLY INSISTED: WHERE ARE THE WEAPONS? PERDIA RESPONDED: "THERE ARE NO WEAPONS. THEY WERE USED IN COMBAT WHEN THERE WAS A MILITARY DICTATORSHIP. THERE IS NO REASON FOR THEM IN A DEMOCRACY." VACA NARVAJA POINTED OUT THAT THE GUARANTEE OF NOT TAKING UP ARMS "LIES IN THE PEOPLE'S CONSCIENCE, BECAUSE ARGENTINA HAS SAID 'NEVER AGAIN' TO MILITARY COUPS AND GUERRILLA WARFARE." "THE SECOND GUARANTEE IS THAT THE POLITICAL STEPS THAT WE TAKE BEFORE THE PEOPLE MUST BE CREDIBLE ENOUGH; THEREFORE, SOME TIME MUST PASS FOR OUR ACTIONS TO BE CONFIRMED," VACA NARVAJA ADDED. CONCLUDING, THE TWO MONTONEROS LEADERS PERFORMED A SELF- CRITICISM OF THE MONTONEROS ORGANIZATION, STATING THAT IT WENT UNDERGROUD "IN AN UNTIMELY FASHION, BECAUSE THERE WERE STILL SOVEREIGN WAYS LEFT FOR THE PEOPLE TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES."
DEV-MUC3-0600	BOGOTA, 17 SEP 89 -- A MILITARY SPOKESMEN HAS SAID THAT TWO POLICEMEN AND THREE GUERRILLAS WERE KILLED TODAY DURING CLASHES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF COLOMBIA. IN A PUBLIC ESTABLISHMENT IN A VILLAGE NEAR BUGALAGRANDE, CAUCA DEPARTMENT, 500 KM WEST OF BOGOTA, SEVEN MEN, WHO HAD RESISTED A ROUTINE SEARCH, ATTACKED A POLICE DETACHMENT AND KILLED TWO POLICEMEN WHO HAD KILLED ONE OF THE GROUP. SOURCES FROM THE ARMY'S THIRD BRIGADE, WITH HEADQUARTERS IN CALI, THE CAPITAL OF THE DEPARTMENT, SAID THAT THE ATTACKERS WERE APPARENTLY MEMBERS OF THE 21ST FRONT OF THE COMMUNIST REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA . MEANWHILE, THE ARMY'S FOURTH BRIGADE, WITH HEADQUARTERS IN MEDELLIN, HAS DECLARED THAT TWO ALLEGED MEMBERS OF THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION WERE KILLED IN A CLASH WITH REGULAR TROOPS WHO SEIZED WEAPONS AND WAR MATERIEL NEAR SALGAR, ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, 550 KM NORTHWEST OF BOGOTA.
DEV-MUC3-0601	SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE -- SAN SALVADOR RADIO CADENA YSKL IN SPANISH AT 1212 GMT ON 9 OCTOBER REPORTS THAT "ACCORDING TO 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE COMMANDER COLONEL MAURICIO ERNESTO VARGAS," BELLOSO BATTALION TROOPS SEIZED FIVE SOVIET-MADE AK-47 RIFLES, 2,000 CARTRIDGES, AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF EXPLOSIVES FOLLOWING A CLASH WITH SUBVERSIVE ELEMENTS IN SAN CRISTOBAL CANTON, SESORI MUNICIPALITY, SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT. THE REPORT QUOTES COL VARGAS AS SAYING THAT "THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE REBELS SUFFERED SEVERAL CASUALTIES, WHO WERE TAKEN BY THEIR COMRADES TO INACCESSIBLE AREAS IN THE REGION." THE ANNOUNCER DOES NOT GIVE A DATE FOR THE REPORT. RADIO VENCEREMOS IN SPANISH TO EL SALVADOR AT 0000 GMT ON 19 OCTOBER REPORTS THAT FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT UNITS INFLICTED 10 CASUALTIES ON THE ARMY ON 17 OCTOBER, SEIZING ONE M-72 ROCKET LAUNCHER AND TWO CARTRIDGE BELTS WITH AMMUNITION FOR M-60 MACHINEGUNS. THE ANNOUNCER SAYS THAT ONE FMLN MILITANT WAS KILLED IN THE ACTION. A SECOND REPORT NOTES THAT "ON 18 OCTOBER GUERRILLA FORCES ATTACKED NATIONAL GUARD UNITS AND CIVIL DEFENSE CRIMINALS IN THE TOWN OF CHINAMECA FOR 1 HOUR, DURING WHICH TIME THE GUERRILLAS ALSO SABOTAGED A TRANSFORMER." ANOTHER REPORT, THIS TIME FROM SANTA ANA, NOTES THAT AS A RESULT OF AN FMLN AMBUSH ON THE SAN SALVADOR-SANTA ANA HIGHWAY, NEAR SAN JUAN BUENA VISTA, THE ARMY'S 2D INFANTRY BRIGADE SUFFERED APPROXIMATELY 15 CASUALTIES. RADIO VENCEREMOS IN SPANISH TO EL SALVADOR AT 0000 GMT ON 23 OCTOBER BROADCASTS A 1-MINUTE MILITARY ROUNDUP REPORT THAT OPENS WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE FMLN INFLICTED 74 CASUALTIES ON THE ARMY DURING THE PAST WEEK. THIS REPORT NOTES THAT THE FMLN CARRIED OUT THREE AMBUSH OPERATIONS DURING THE WEEK: ONE IN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT, ONE ON THE SAN SALVADOR-SANTA ANA HIGHWAY, AND THE THIRD ON THE PAN- AMERICAN HIGHWAY.
DEV-MUC3-0602	BOGOTA, 23 OCT 89 -- THE GROUP OF "EXTRADITABLES" IN COLOMBIA, BELIEVED TO BE THE ARMED BRANCH OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, SAID TODAY THAT IT IS PREPARED TO DECLARE A TRUCE IF THE CONGRESS OF THE REPUBLIC FORMS A "GRAND COMMISSION ON A DIALOGUE FOR PEACE." THE TRAFFICKERS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, WHO ALONG WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE CALI CARTEL FORM THE MOST IMPORTANT COCAINE PROCESSING AND DISTRIBUTION ORGANIZATIONS IN THE WORLD, MADE THEIR PROPOSAL IN A LETTER ADDRESSED TO LUIS GUILLERMO GIRALDO, PRESIDENT OF THE COLOMBIAN CONGRESS. THE "EXTRADITABLES" SAY THAT THE DIALOGUE COMMISSION MUST INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER PEOPLE, CARDINALS MARIO REVOLLO Y BRAVO AND ALFONSO LOPEZ TRUJILLO, MEDELLIN MAYOR JUAN GOMEZ MARTINEZ, FORMER MINISTER JOAQUIN VALLEJO ARBALAEZ, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL CARLOS JIMENEZ GOMEZ, AND FORMER PARLIAMENTARIAN GUIDO PARRA MONTOYA. THE "GRAND COMMISSION" MUST ALSO INCLUDE "REPRESENTATIVES OF LEFTIST MASS ORGANIZATIONS AND THE SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS, AND SHOULD SEEK A TRUCE BETWEEN THE RIGHT WING AND THE LEFT WING," ACCORDING TO THE LETTER. THE DRUG KINGPINS SAID THAT THEY "AGREE THAT THE TOPIC OF EXTRADITION SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE REFERENDUM," BECAUSE "WE DO NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF MOBILIZING THE MASSES IN THE STRUGGLE CONCERNING THE TURNOVER OF CITIZENS." IN THE LETTER, THE ARMED BRANCH OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL LISTS FOUR POINTS THAT IT BELIEVES COULD RESTORE PUBLIC ORDER IN COLOMBIA. THREE OF THE POINTS DEAL WITH NONEXTRADITION, AND THE FOURTH CALLS FOR THE LIFTING OF THE STATE OF SIEGE, BECAUSE IT WAS UNDER THE POWERS GRANTED IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY ISSUED ON 18 AUGUST THAT PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S ADMINISTRATION APPLIED A NUMBER OF MEASURES TO COMBAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKING. ON THAT OCCASION, WHEN PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LUIS CARLOS GALAN WAS ASSASSINATED, BARCO DECLARED AN "ALL-OUT WAR" ON THE DRUG MAFIAS, REINSTATED EXTRADITION BY ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS WITHOUT PRIOR JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS, AND ANNOUNCED THE CONFISCATION OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS' PROPERTY. IN A DECLARATION ISSUED 6 DAYS LATER, THE "EXTRADITABLES" ANNOUNCED A "COUNTEROFFENSIVE" AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT, THE JUDGES, THE PRESS, AND THE "REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BOURGEOISIE" IN REPRISAL FOR THE OFFICIAL ACTIONS. AT THE END OF THE LETTER ISSUED TODAY, THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS URGED THE PUBLIC TO "REFLECT," AND ADDED: "WE ALL WANT TO END THE DRUG TRAFFICKING." "THE GOVERNMENT," THEY SAID, "WANTS TO END IT THROUGH ACTIONS OF WAR, WHILE WE OFFER TO END IT THROUGH A DIALOGUE FOR PEACE." THE LETTER ENDS WITH THE QUESTION: "WHO IS RIGHT?"
DEV-MUC3-0603	BOGOTA, 24 OCT 89 -- THE POSSIBILITIES FOR A DIALOGUE WITH DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE INCREASED IN COLOMBIA DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS AFTER THE EXTRADITABLES ANNOUNCED THEY ARE WILLING TO END THE WAR. THREE OF THE LEADERS MENTIONED IN THE EXTRADITABLES' LETTER THAT CONTAINED A PROPOSAL TO TAKE PART IN A COMMISSION THAT WOULD REPORTEDLY BEGIN MAKING CONTACTS FOR THE DIALOGUE TODAY ACCEPTED THE MISSION AND SAID THAT THEY ARE READY TO COOPERATE IN THE COUNTRY'S PEACE EFFORTS. THEY ARE MEDELLIN MAYOR JUAN GOMEZ MARTINEZ, FORMER LIBERAL LEGISLATOR GUIDO PARRA, AND FORMER CONSERVATIVE MINISTER JOAQUIN VALLEJO. MEANWHILE, CARDINAL MARIO REVOLLO SAID THAT "THE MATTER MUST BE STUDIED." THE EXTRADITABLES PROPOSED CREATING A NEGOTIATING COMMISSION IN A LETTER SENT FROM CLANDESTINITY TO LIBERAL SENATOR LUIS GUILLERMO GIRALDO, PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS. THE POSSIBILITY OF A DIALOGUE IS UNDER CONSIDERATION BY SOME POLITICAL GROUPS, DESPITE THE POSITION ASSUMED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBERAL PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, WHO HAS REPEATEDLY STATED HIS OPPOSITION TO ANY STEP LEADING TO NEGOTIATIONS WITH DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND DRUG TERRORISTS. BARCO, THROUGH GOVERNMENT MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS, HAS PUBLICLY SAID THAT A DIALOGUE WITH TERRORISM IS IMPOSSIBLE, AT LEAST IN THE NEAR FUTURE. IN VIEW OF THE SITUATION, SOME POLITICAL SECTORS HAVE SPECULATED ON THE POSSIBILITY OF NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN BARCO'S SUCCESSOR, WHO WILL BE ELECTED IN FREE ELECTIONS IN MAY 1990. BARCO WILL LEAVE POWER ON 7 AUGUST 1990. THE MAFIA HAS PROMISED TO END THE WAVE OF TERRORISM UNLEASHED SEVERAL WEEKS AGO IF BARCO'S GOVERNMENT SUSPENDS THE EXTRADITION OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO THE UNITED STATES. THEY HAVE ALSO PROPOSED ACCEPTING THE DECISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE, WHICH RECOGNIZED THE LEGALITY OF THE MEASURES ADOPTED TO FACE THE MAFIAS, BUT DID NOT RECOMMEND EXTRADITION BY EXECUTIVE DECREE. THE COURT RULED THAT INTERNATIONAL LAW PREVAILS OVER COLOMBIAN LAW, AND NOTED THAT EXTRADITION THROUGH A STATE OF SIEGE DECREE IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE CURRENT COLOMBIAN-U.S. TREATY. COLOMBIA AND THE UNITED STATES SIGNED AN EXTRADITION TREATY IN 1979 WHICH, ALTHOUGH IT IS STILL IN EFFECT, CANNOT BE APPLIED BECAUSE AT THE END OF 1987 THE SUPREME COURT ITSELF INVALIDATED THE LAW THAT ENFORCED IT. HOWEVER, SEVERAL COLOMBIAN JURISTS SAID TODAY THAT ONLY THE COLOMBIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY CAN DETERMINE WHETHER TO ACCEPT THE COURT'S DECISION OR TO CONTINUE ACTING BY EXECUTIVE DECREE. IN THEIR PEACE PROPOSAL, THE EXTRADITABLES DEMANDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT "GRANT COLOMBIANS THEIR LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO DEFENSE, ALLOWING THEM -- AS DEPORTED FOREIGNERS ARE ALLOWED -- TO EXHAUST ALL LEGAL MEANS UNDER ADMINISTRATIVE LAW BEFORE RENOUNCING SOVEREIGNTY AND TURNING THEM OVER BY EXTRADITION." VALLEJO, PARRA, AND GOMEZ MARTINEZ -- THE THREE MEMBERS PROPOSED BY THE MAFIA TO PARTICIPATE IN THE NEGOTIATING COMMISSION -- SAID TODAY THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO WORK IN FAVOR OF PEACE IN THE COUNTRY. THEY AGREED THAT DIFFERENCES CAN ONLY BE EASED THROUGH DIALOGUE. "I AM WILLING TO TALK," SAID GOMEZ MARTINEZ, MAYOR OF MEDELLIN, WHERE THE MEDELLIN CARTEL OPERATES. OVER A YEAR AGO, GOMEZ MARTINEZ WAS THE TARGET OF AN ATTACK BY THE THE EXTRADITABLES, WHO TRIED TO KIDNAP HIM. "I AM WAITING FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S OKEY TO BEGIN THE DIALOGUE," HE ADDED. VALLEJO, WHO DISCLOSED THAT IN MID-1988 HE PRESENTED TO BARCO'S GOVERNMENT AN INITIAL DIALOGUE PROPOSAL FROM THE EXTRADITABLES, SAID THAT "I AM WILLING TO TALK IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE PEACE." PARRA, A FORMER PARLIAMENTARIAN AND FRIEND OF PABLO ESCOBAR, THE MEDELLIN CARTEL'S CHIEF, SAID THAT "I AM WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE PEACE EFFORTS." OTHER SECTORS, PARTICULARLY POLITICAL GROUPS, AGREED THAT NEGOTIATION IS THE ONLY WAY TO PUT AN END TO TERRORIST VIOLENCE IN COLOMBIA.
DEV-MUC3-0604	BOGOTA, 24 OCT 89 -- THE GOVERNMENT SAID TODAY THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO EXTRADITE COLOMBIAN CITIZENS SOUGHT BY THE UNITED STATES. THE GOVERNMENT WILL USE ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS BECAUSE THERE IS CURRENTLY NO EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THAT COUNTRY. IN A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH ALSO DENIED ANY POSSIBILITY OF PARTICIPATING IN A DIALOGUE WITH DRUG TRAFFICKERS. THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL'S COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT THE GOVERNMENT POLICY IS TO STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG-TRAFFICKING GROUPS AND THEIR CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS. THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS THAT THE POLICY ALLOWS NO ROOM FOR TRANSACTIONS, NEGOTIATIONS, OR DIALOGUES. THEREFORE, THE GOVERNMENT REJECTS ANY PROPOSAL TO MEDIATE WITH DRUG TRAFFICKERS -- EVEN IF THE PROPOSAL IS DIRECTLY ISSUED BY THE EXTRADITABLES OR THEIR SPOKESMEN. THE COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO ENFORCE LEGISLATIVE DECREE 18-60 OF 1989, WHICH ALLOWS FOR EXTRADITIONS THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS. THIS DECREE WAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE. THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL JUSTIFIES ITS DECISION BY RECALLING THE MANY ACTS OF TERRORISM PERPETRATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS -- 222 IN 2 MONTHS -- AND THE NAMES OF THE VICTIMS. THE COMMUNIQUE SAYS THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARE NOW TRYING TO DISGUISE THEIR CRIMINAL POSITIONS BY CLAIMING THAT THEY ADVOCATE PEACE. THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE ENFORCEMENT OR SUSPENSION OF COLOMBIAN CITIZENS' EXTRADITION WAS THE MAIN TOPIC DISCUSSED TODAY IN JURIDICAL AND POLITICAL CIRCLES IN OUR COUNTRY AND IN THE UNITED STATES. JOURNALISTS AND LAWYERS CAREFULLY READ THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE'S RULING ON THE DECREE ALLOWING FOR EXTRADITIONS THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS. EVERYONE WANTED TO KNOW WHY THE EXTRADITABLES SAID, IN A LETTER ISSUED YESTERDAY, THAT THEY FULLY ABIDED BY THE COURT'S RULING. THE COURT RULED THAT, ALTHOUGH THE EXTRADITIONS VIA ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS ARE ALLOWED BY THE CONSTITUTION IN CASES WHERE THERE IS ALREADY AN INTERNATIONAL TREATY, THE EXTRADITION MUST BE CARRIED OUT ACCORDING TO THE TREATY. THE COURT BELIEVES THAT THE RULING IS QUITE CLEAR. THE GOVERNMENT MUST DECIDE IF THERE IS A TREATY WITH THE UNITED STATES OR NOT BEFORE IT ENFORCES THE EXTRADITION THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS. NEVERTHELESS, THE COURT'S RULING DOES NOT END THE EXTRADITIONS TO THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE, EVEN THOUGH THE COURT BELIEVES THAT AN EXTRADITION TREATY IS STILL IN EFFECT WITH THAT COUNTRY -- THE ONE SIGNED IN 1888 -- AND THAT IT SHOULD BE ENFORCED INSTEAD OF RESORTING TO EXTRADITIONS THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS, THE GOVERNMENT CLEARLY SAYS THERE IS NO EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE UNITED STATES. THE 1979 TREATY HAD BEEN ANNULLED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE, BUT ACCORDING TO THE STATE COUNCIL, THAT TREATY REPLACED -- SO TO SPEAK -- THE 1933 TREATY SIGNED IN MONTEVIDEO AND THE 1888 TREATY. THEREFORE, THINGS ARE NOW THE SAME AS YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE. MEANWHILE, THE BODYGUARD OF EL ESPECTADOR'S CHIEF OF DISTRIBUTION IN MEDELLIN, PEDRO LUIS OSORIO, WAS ASSASSINATED THIS AFTERNOON IN A DOWNTOWN AREA OF ANTIOQUIA'S CAPITAL.
DEV-MUC3-0605	CARTAGENA, 24 OCT 89 -- THE POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT A CARBOMB EXPLODED TONIGHT IN A RESIDENTIAL SECTOR IN THIS COLOMBIAN PORT OF CARTAGENA, SLIGHTLY INJURING ONLY TWO PEOPLE, BUT CAUSING MUCH DAMAGE. THE BOMB SERIOUSLY DAMAGED THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE OF THE BOCAGRANDE TOURIST AND RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT, A HOTEL, A RESTAURANT, TWO MEDICAL CLINICS, AND A CONSTRUCTION SITE. ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE TWO WOMEN WHO WERE SLIGHTLY INJURED, THE BOMB WAS PLACED BY TWO MEN IN A CAR, WHICH THEY HURRIEDLY ABANDONED 40 METERS FROM THE TELEPHONE OFFICE. THE AREA, WHICH WAS BLACKED OUT WHEN THE ELECTRIC LINES WERE DESTROYED AND WAS LITTERED WITH GLASS, WAS CORDONED OFF BY POLICE, WHO LAUNCHED A SEARCH THROUGHOUT THE CITY FOR THE TERRORISTS. SERGEANT MARTINEZ OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT SAID THAT THE BOMB HAD CAUSED MUCH DAMAGE, ALTHOUGH HE ABSTAINED FROM GIVING AN ESTIMATE UNTIL THE BUILDINGS ARE EXAMINED. ALTHOUGH NO ONE HAS CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE BOMBING, PRESS SECTORS BLAMED IT ON THE DRUG MAFIA AGAINST WHOM THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECLARED WAR.
DEV-MUC3-0606	LA PAZ, 23 OCT 89 -- BOLIVIAN OFFICIALS HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR CONCERN OVER THE PRESENCE OF PERUVIAN SHINING PATH TERRORISTS ON THE BORDER BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.

GENERAL FELIPE CARVAJAL, COMMANDER GENERAL OF THE NATIONAL POLICE, STATED: "THE SHINING PATH IS OPERATING ALONG OUR BORDERS AND WE HAVE DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT SO FAR." DEFENSE MINISTER HECTOR ORMACHEA YESTERDAY ANNOUNCED THAT MILITARY TROOPS WILL BE DEPLOYED FROM BOLIVIAN CITIES TO THE BORDER AREAS. ACCORDING TO THE DEFENSE MINISTER, THE NEXT DEPLOYMENT OF MILITARY FORCES TO REINFORCE THE BORDER AREAS FOLLOWS REPORTS ON "THE UNPRECEDENTED ENTRY OF FOREIGNERS WHO ARE PLUNDERING" THE COUNTRY'S NATURAL RESOURCES, INCLUDING WOOD AND GOLD. MOREOVER, THE POLICE COMMANDER HAS STATED THAT TERRORISM "IS A PERMANENT LATENT FACTOR" IN BOLIVIA. AS AN EXAMPLE HE MENTIONED THE INDIAN-MARXIST ORGANIZATION "ZARATE WILLKA ARMED FORCES OF LIBERATION." THIS GROUP BEGAN ITS ACTIVITIES IN AUGUST 1988 WHEN IT ATTACKED THE OFFICIAL MOTORCADE IN WHICH THE THEN-SECRETARY OF STATE GEORGE SHULTZ WAS TRAVELING. NO INJURIES WHERE CAUSED BY THE ATTACK. ON 24 MAY THIS YEAR, THE SAME ORGANIZATION MURDERED TWO U.S. MORMON MISSIONARIES ON A CROWDED STREET IN LA PAZ.
DEV-MUC3-0607	MOSCOW , 26 OCT 89 -- A DISPATCH FROM LIMA. TERRORIST ACTS WERE CARRIED OUT ON WEDNESDAY EVENING IN THE PERUVIAN CAPITAL AGAINST THE EMBASSIES OF THE USSR AND THE PRC. UNKNOWN PEOPLE WHO DROVE UP TO THE USSR EMBASSY IN A CAR PLACED A BOMB UNDER ONE OF THE SOVIET DIPLOMATS' CARS. BY A STROKE OF LUCK THERE ARE NO DEATHS OR CASUALTIES. THE CRIMINALS MANAGED TO ESCAPE. WITHIN 15 MINUTES THE TERRORISTS DETONATED A CAR STUFFED WITH EXPLOSIVES THAT HAD BEEN LEFT AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE PREMISES OF THE DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.

ORTEGA, ADDRESSING STUDENTS IN THE AUDITORIUM OF THE UNIVERSITY OF COSTA RICA'S LAW SCHOOL, CONFIRMED THAT "WE HAVE NO OTHER WAY OUT BUT TO SUSPEND THE CEASE-FIRE" IN ORDER TO "HIT THE CONTRAS HARD," BECAUSE -- HE ASSURED -- THEY HAVE FAILED TO RESPECT THE TRUCE ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS. "THE CEASE-FIRE EXTENSIONS ARE OVER," ORTEGA SAID, STRESSING THAT "WE CANNOT GO ON WITH OUR HANDS TIED," AND HE PROMISED TO PROVIDE FURTHER DETAILS REGARDING THIS STATEMENT ON 28 OCTOBER AT A NEWS CONFERENCE. "THE STRAW THAT BROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK," HE SAID, WAS AN ATTACK ON 21 OCTOBER WHEN THE CONTRAS MURDERED 19 PEASANTS WHO WERE ON THE WAY TO REGISTER TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. "WE MUST GUARANTEE THE ELECTIONS," ORTEGA UNDERSCORED, POINTING OUT THAT 2 DAYS AGO TWO ACTIVISTS FROM THE FSLN WERE ALSO MURDERED, WHICH CONSTITUTES "AN ATTEMPT AGAINST THE ELECTORAL PROCESS." IN VIEW OF THIS SITUATION, HE ADDED, ON 22 OCTOBER "I MET WITH THE ARMY COMMANDERS AND WE CONCLUDED THAT OUR HANDS WERE TIED" WITH THE CEASE-FIRE DECREE. "THE UNITED STATES IS NOT REALLY WILLING TO DEMOBILIZE THE CONTRAS AND THE CONTRAS AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE CEASE-FIRE TO INCREASE THEIR ACTIONS," HE ADDED, EMPHASIZING THAT "WE CANNOT MAINTAIN IT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS." "WE MUST SEEK A WAY TO GUARANTEE THE LIFE OF THE NICARAGUANS, SO THE CEASE-FIRE MUST END," HE STATED, ADDING THAT THE TOP-ECHELONS ALSO DECIDED TO "ORGANIZE THE DEFENSE OF OUR COUNTRY EVEN BETTER." REFERRING TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PLAN, ORTEGA EMPHASIZED THAT "WE MUST FULFILL OUR PLEDGES" CONCERNING THE CONTRAS' DEMOBILIZATION, AND THE HONDURAN PRESIDENT ADVOCATES IT EVEN THOUGH THE UNITED STATES IS NOT WILLING TO DO THAT. THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT WORE A UNIFORM AND HAD A RED AND BLACK HANDKERCHIEF TIED AROUND HIS NECK UPON HIS ARRIVAL AT THE UNIVERSITY, LOCATED IN EASTERN SAN JOSE. HE WAS CHEERED AND APPLAUDED BY AN EUPHORIC AUDIENCE THAT HAD BEEN WAITING FOR HIM SINCE 1800. ORTEGA ALSO SPOKE ABOUT OTHER TOPICS DURING THE HOUR, MAINLY THOSE DISCUSSED AT THE HEMISPHERIC SUMMIT HE IS ATTENDING ALONG WITH 15 HEADS OF STATE FROM THE CONTINENT -- INCLUDING THE FOREIGN DEBT, DISARMAMENT, AND DEVELOPMENT. "I HAVE COME TO THIS MEETING WITH THE DESIRE TO TALK TO ALL OF THE HEADS OF STATE PARTICIPATING," HE NOTED, ADDING THAT "I AM PLEASED WITH THE TALKS I HAVE HELD," ON THE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, THE DEBT, TRADE, THE DRUG TRAFFICKING FIGHT, THE SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA, AND THE NEED TO A PROMOTE THE NORTH-SOUTH DIALOGUE. IN ADDITION, HE SAID THAT HE DISCUSSED THE COFFEE PROBLEM WITH BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT JOSE SARNEY, COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, AND THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT IN VIEW OF THE NEED TO SEEK A COMMON LATIN AMERICAN POSITION TO FIX THE COFFEE PRICE. REGARDING EL SALVADOR, THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT INSISTED THAT "NOT EVEN THE SLIGHTEST COMPARISON CAN BE MADE BETWEEN THE CONTRAS AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT ." "THE CONTRAS' CAMPS ARE IN HONDURAN TERRITORY AND THE FMLN'S CAMPS ARE IN EL SALVADOR, HE SAID, POINTING OUT THAT "THIS IS VERIFIABLE," AND "EL SALVADOR'S PROBLEM IS NOT NICARAGUA'S PROBLEM." REGARDING PANAMA, ORTEGA SAID THAT WE DEFEND SELF-DETERMINATION AND "ALL OF LATIN AMERICAN SHOULD BE CONCERNED THAT THE PANAMANIANS ARE THE ONES WHO FIND A SOLUTION TO THEIR PROBLEMS." AT THE CONCLUSION OF HIS "CHAT" WITH THE STUDENTS, ORTEGA WENT IMMEDIATELY TO THE NATIONAL THEATRE, IN DOWNTOWN SAN JOSE, WHERE THE 16 HEADS OF STATE OF THE CONTINENT WERE SCHEDULED TO DINE TONIGHT, DURING THE CONTINUATION OF THE EVENTS MARKING THE CENTENNIAL OF COSTA RICAN DEMOCRACY.
DEV-MUC3-0610	MOSCOW , 27 OCT 89 -- ON THE MORNING OF 26 OCTOBER THE EDITORIAL OFFICE RECEIVED TELEGRAMS FROM REUTERS AND AFP FROM THE PERUVIAN CAPITAL, WHICH SAID THAT BOMBS HAD GONE OFF THE DAY BEFORE OUTSIDE THE SOVIET AND PRC EMBASSIES IN LIMA. OUR CORRESPONDENT YEVGENIY BAY CONTACTED VLADIMIR KOTOV, HEAD OF THE TASS DEPARTMENT IN PERU, BY TELEPHONE AND ASKED HIM FOR THE DETAILS. ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS DROVE UP TO THE SOVIET EMBASSY BUILDING AND PLANTED A BOMB UNDER A CAR BELONGING TO ONE OF OUR DIPLOMATIC PERSONNEL. THEY HARDLY HAD TIME TO DRIVE OFF BEFORE AN EXPLOSION RANG OUT. ONE CAR WAS TOTALLY DESTROYED AND THREE NEIGHBORING VEHICLES WERE DAMAGED. THIS HAPPENED AT 2015 LOCAL TIME. AND AT 2030 HOURS A VOLKSWAGEN PARKED NEAR THE ENTRANCE OF THE PRC EMBASSY EXPLODED AFTER BEING PACKED WITH DYNAMITE. FORTUNATELY, THERE ARE NO CASUALTIES AND NO MEMBERS OF THE DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS ARE HURT. THE BUILDINGS ARE NOT REALLY DAMAGED. SO FAR, ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION AGENCIES, NONE OF THE TERRORIST GROUPS OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY HAVE TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ACTION, ALTHOUGH THE POLICE SUSPECT THE EXTREME LEFT-WING MAOIST ORGANIZATION, "SENDERO LUMINOSO." JUDGING BY THE HALLMARK, IT COULD QUITE WELL BE. AS IS WELL KNOWN, "SENDERO LUMINOSO" HAS CARRIED OUT SEVERAL ATTACKS ON SOVIET MISSIONS AND OUR CITIZENS IN THE LAST 3 YEARS. MANY REMEMBER THE INCIDENT WHEN FOUR UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE TELEPHONED THE SOVIET EMBASSY -- ALLEGEDLY TO DELIVER SOME SORT OF PACKAGE. IN THE END, ONE OF THE TERRORISTS GOT INTO THE EMBASSY GROUNDS AND, AT THAT MOMENT, THE "PACKAGE" EXPLODED IN HIS HANDS. AND SEVERAL MONTHS AGO TERRORISTS PLANTED A BOMB UNDER A BUS IN WHICH SOVIET FISHERMEN WERE TRAVELING. AN EXTENSION OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY IN THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ESCALATION IN TERRORIST ACTIONS. HOW DOES THE SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY LOOK FROM WHERE YOU STAND? THE STATE OF EMERGENCY WAS INTRODUCED HERE IN FEBRUARY 1986 AND HAS BEEN EXTENDED VIRTUALLY EVERY 30-60 DAYS SINCE THEN. IT IS IN EFFECT IN 35 PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY'S TERRITORY, PARTICULARLY IN LIMA AND THE CAPITALS OF A NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS. HOWEVER, THE WAVE OF TERRORISM IS SHOWING NO SIGN OF ABATING -- EITHER ON THE PART OF THE FAR RIGHT OR THE FAR LEFT. IN OCTOBER ALONE, THEIR ACTIONS CLAIMED 200 LIVES. "SENDERO LUMINOSO" IS TRYING TO INTIMIDATE THE POPULATION AND WRECK THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS PLANNED FOR 12 NOVEMBER. THEY HAVE PARTIALLY ACHIEVED THEIR AIM. TO THE UNINFORMED, PERUVIAN STATISTICS ARE SIMPLY HORRIFYING: IN THE LAST 3 YEARS, 64 MAYORS OF VARIOUS SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED TOWNS IN THE ANDES HAVE BEEN KILLED. NATURALLY, THERE ARE FEW BRAVE ENOUGH TO TAKE THE RISK OF HOLDING THIS POST. WHAT KIND OF CONDITIONS ARE SOVIET REPRESENTATIVES IN PERU LIVING AND WORKING IN? SO FAR THERE HAVE BEEN NO RESTRICTIONS ON OUR FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT. HOWEVER, THE ESCALATION OF TERRORISM NATURALLY AFFECTS OUR WELLBEING. PEOPLE LIVE IN A STATE OF TENSION. YOU EXPECT SOMETHING AWFUL TO HAPPEN AT ANY MOMENT. YOU HAVE TO SHOW THE MAXIMUM CAUTION EVERYWHERE: BOTH AT HOME AND ON THE STREET.
DEV-MUC3-0611	MEDELLIN, 28 OCT 89 -- FIVE WOMEN WERE MURDERED AND THEIR BODIES THROWN FROM A MOVING VEHICLE EARLY THIS MORNING IN EL POBLADO NEIGHBORHOOD OF MEDELLIN.

DURING AN INTERVIEW GRANTED IN SAN JOSE TO CNN, A U.S. TELEVISION NETWORK, CRISTIANI ALSO SAID THAT HE HAS DISCARDED THE POSSIBILITY OF A MILITARY INTERVENTION IN PANAMA. REGARDING HIS TALKS WITH THE ARMED OPPOSITION IN HIS COUNTRY HE SAID HE IS "CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC." CRISTIANI SAID HE WOULD BE "DISAPPOINTED" IF THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT WERE TO SUSPEND THE UNILATERAL CEASE-FIRE DECREED ON 21 MARCH 1988. THIS WOULD PROVE, CRISTIANI SAID, THAT ORTEGA IS NOT WILLING "TO RESPECT THE PROMISES MADE IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PLAN" SIGNED IN 1987 BY COSTA RICA, EL SALVADOR, NICARAGUA, GUATEMALA, AND HONDURAS. ACCORDING TO CRISTIANI, ORTEGA HAS ALREADY BROKEN HIS COMMITMENT BY CONTINUING TO SEND ARMS TO THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT , AS HONDURAS REVEALED THIS WEEK. CRISTIANI ADMITTED, HOWEVER, THAT "NOT MUCH CAN BE DONE" IF ORTEGA UPHOLDS THE DECISION HE ANNOUNCED ON 27 OCTOBER IN SAN JOSE WHERE HE AND 15 OTHER CHIEFS OF STATE OF THE CONTINENT ATTENDED AN INTER - AMERICAN SUMMIT. REGARDING PANAMA, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT SAID THAT THE OAS COUNTRIES WILL "CONTINUE MAKING EFFORTS, ESPECIALLY DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS, TO ESTABLISH DEMOCRACY" IN THAT COUNTRY "IN THE NEAR FUTURE." HE DISCARDED THE POSSIBILITY OF A MILITARY INTERVENTION IN PANAMA. "NO ONE HERE IS IN FAVOR OF A MILITARY INTERVENTION IN PANAMA." CRISTIANI STATED HIS SUPPORT FOR U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH WITH REGARD TO THE RECENT COUP ATTEMPT IN PANAMA. CRISTIANI SAID THAT BUSH "DID WHAT HE HAD TO" WHEN HE REJECTED A MILITARY INTERVENTION ON THE SIDE OF THE COUPISTS. REGARDING THE PEACE TALKS HIS GOVERNMENT IS HOLDING WITH THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT , CRISTIANI DECLARED HIMSELF "CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC" AND NOTED THAT CONTRARY TO THE TALKS HELD BETWEEN THE FMLN AND FORMER PRESIDENT JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, THE CURRENT MEETINGS ARE NOT "ISOLATED EVENTS." NOW, HE SAID, "THE PROCESS IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT." THIS PROCESS, HE ADDED, IS THE "RESULT OF AN AGREEMENT SIGNED LAST SEPTEMBER IN MEXICO BY THE TWO SIDES." REGARDING CHARGES BY A SALVADORAN SOLDIER, CESAR VIELMAN JOYA MARTINEZ, WHO SAID THIS WEEK THAT HE PARTICIPATED IN ASSASSINATIONS COMMITTED BY A DEATH SQUAD ON ORDERS, ACCORDING TO HIM, FROM THE SALVADORAN HIGH MILITARY COMMAND AND WHO ALSO NOTED THAT U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS HAD TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON, CRISTIANI SAID THAT THESE CHARGES ARE PART OF "FMLN EFFORTS" TO DISCREDIT HIS GOVERNMENT. MARTINEZ WILL BE "SENTENCED TO JAIL FOR HAVING DONE WHAT HE HAS SAID HE HAS DONE," CRISTIANI SAID. THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ADMITTED THAT THIS TYPE OF INCIDENT STILL OCCURS BUT NOTED THAT THE SALVADORAN AUTHORITIES PUNISH CRIME. CRISTIANI CONCLUDED BY STATING: "MARTINEZ IS A DESERTER AND A WARRANT FOR HIS ARREST HAS BEEN ISSUED." JOYA MARTINEZ, WHO FLED HIS COUNTRY IN JULY AND SOUGHT POLITICAL ASYLUM IN THE UNITED STATES, MADE HIS STATEMENTS TO A GROUP OF JOURNALISTS IN WASHINGTON.
DEV-MUC3-0613	BOGOTA, 28 OCT 89 -- "THE EXTRADITABLES" CLANDESTINE GROUP TODAY CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR LAST NIGHT'S DYNAMITE ATTACK AGAINST A POLICE AIR BASE AT GUAIMARAL, 25 KM TO THE NORTH OF BOGOTA, KILLING A NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER. THROUGH ANONYMOUS PHONE CALLS TO VARIOUS MEDIA IN THE NORTHEAST OF MEDELLIN, ANTIOQUIA PROVINCE, THE EXTRADITABLES CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR PLACING A BOMB INSIDE ONE OF THE SMALL AIRPORT'S BATHROOMS. THE EXTRADITABLES ARE COMPRISED OF THE MAIN COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKING CAPOS, WHO, THROUGH VIOLENT ACTS, ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE GOVERNMENT GIVE UP ON ITS DECISION TO EXTRADITE THEM TO THE UNITED STATES. THE AUTHORITIES ARE SAYING NOTHING ABOUT THE ATTACK AND DENIED NEWSMEN ACCESS TO THE TERMINAL. THE AIRPORT HOUSES AIRCRAFT USED BY ANTINARCOTICS POLICE.
DEV-MUC3-0614	LIMA, 28 OCT 89 -- PERUVIAN DRUG TRAFFICKER EMILIO REYNOSO AGUILAR, ALIAS "RETACO I," ARRIVED IN LIMA TODAY UNDER STRICT POLICE SECURITY. REYNOSO WAS EXTRADITED FROM COLOMBIA TO BE TRIED HERE ON CHARGES OF MURDER, KIDNAPPING, DRUG TRAFFICKING, ROBBERY, AND OTHER CRIMES. "RETACO I" IS LINKED TO COLOMBIA'S MEDELLIN CARTEL. HE WAS HANDED OVER TO PERUVIAN POLICE OFFICERS WHO HAD TRAVELED TO COLOMBIA TO BRING HIM TO LIMA, WHERE HE IS UNDER INDICTMENT BY NINE DIFFERENT COURTS. REYNOSO IS KNOWN IN LIMA AS "THE ESCAPE KING" BECAUSE HE HAS ESCAPED FROM PERUVIAN JAILS A NUMBER OF TIMES DISGUISED AS A WOMAN OR A POLICE OFFICER. REYNOSO ESCAPED FROM THE JUSTICE PALACE AFTER TAKING THE POLICE OFFICER GUARDING HIM HOSTAGE. "RETACO I'S" BROTHERS HAVE SIMILAR ALIASES; THEY ARE CALLED RETACO II, III, AND IV. ALL OF THEM HAVE ACCOUNTS TO SETTLE WITH THE COURTS, BUT ONLY ONE OF THEM IS CURRENTLY IN JAIL. "RETACO I" LEFT PERU ON 1984 TO CONTINUE HIS CRIMINAL CAREER IN OTHER COUNTRIES. HE FINALLY ENDED UP IN COLOMBIA, WHERE HE WORKED WITH DRUG TRAFFICKERS UNTIL HIS ARREST. REYNOSO IS CONSIDERED VERY DANGEROUS. THE PROBLEM FOR THE PERUVIAN POLICE WILL NOW BE TO KEEP "THE ESCAPE KING" IN JAIL.

DEV-MUC3-0626	CLANDESTINE, 31 OCT 89 -- CONCERNING THE MASSACRE AT THE FENASTRAS HEADQUARTERS, THE FMLN REPORTS THE FOLLOWING: 1. WE BLAME THIS COWARDLY CRIME ON THE GENERAL STAFF AND COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, WHO YESTERDAY PROMISED TO REACT TO OUR ATTACKS ON THE GENERAL STAFF. IT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED THAT THE HIGH COMMAND IS WAGING WAR AGAINST THE PEOPLE ESTABLISHED IN SAN JOSE WITH REGARD TO HIS VIEW OF THE HOSTILITIES, THAT HE CONSIDERS POPULAR MOVEMENTS TO BE FMLN SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS. 2. THIS TERRORIST ACTION, ADDED TO THOSE COMMITTED AT THE UNIVERSITY; UPON THE HOMES OF POLITICAL LEADERS; AND AT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO COMMITTEE OF MOTHERS, RELATIVES OF POLITICAL PRISONERS, MISSING, AND MURDERED PEOPLE , WHICH HAVE RESULTED IN 9 DEATHS AND 46 INJURIES, CREATE A NEW SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY THAT FORCES THE PEOPLE'S STRUGGLE TO IMPLEMENT THE USE OF SELF-DEFENSE. THE FMLN HAD RELAXED SOME OF ITS POSITIONS IN AN EFFORT TO OPEN A TRUE NEGOTIATION PROCESS, BUT THIS INADMISSIBLE SITUATION REAFFIRMS THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ABANDON THE ARMED STRUGGLE. 3. THESE EVENTS CARRIED OUT BY THE HIGH COMMAND AND LA TANDONA ENDANGER THE CARACAS MEETING. WE JOIN IN THE PROFOUND GRIEF OF THE POPULAR MOVEMENT AND THE MEMBERS OF FENASTRAS OVER THEIR COMRADES' DEATH, ESPECIALLY THAT OF THEIR BELOVED LEADER FEBE ELIZABETH VELAZQUEZ. ALL OF THESE PEOPLE ARE ADDED TO THE GROWING LIST OF CRIMES THAT THESE SINISTER FORCES HAVE PERPETRATED OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS. ONLY A RESOLUTE, COMBATIVE STRUGGLE WITH WEAPONS IN HAND WILL DO JUSTICE FOR ALL OF THESE CRIMES. LA TANDONA AND ARENA MEAN DICTATORSHIP AND WAR. EVERYONE MUST GO AGAINST ARENA AND LA TANDONA.

DEV-MUC3-0629	MANAGUA , 1 NOV 89 -- MR PRESIDENT, REGARDING POINT NO. 6 IN WHICH YOU SPOKE ABOUT SPECIFIC RESULTS CONCERNING THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE CONTRAS, TO WHAT SPECIFIC AMOUNTS IS THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT REFERRING TO? ARE YOU SAYING THAT 20 PERCENT, 10 PERCENT OR 50 PERCENT OF THE CONTRAS HAVE TO BE DEMOBILIZED IN ORDER FOR THE CEASE-FIRE TO BE IMPLEMENTED AGAIN? THE IMPORTANT POINT IS TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING THE PLAN. THEN, THE NUMBER OF CONTRAS THAT ARE DEMOBILIZED WOULD BE ESTABLISHED ACCORDING TO THE DECISIONS MADE AT THE UNITED NATIONS. THAT IS, HOW MANY CONTRAS CAN BE DEMOBILIZED RIGHT AWAY, HOW MANY OF THEM WILL BE RETURNING TO NICARAGUA, HOW MANY WILL GO TO THIRD COUNTRIES. THEREFORE, TO THE EXTENT THE PLAN IS BEING IMPLEMENTED, WE WILL BE WILLING TO REINSTATE THE CEASE-FIRE. MR PRESIDENT, UP UNTIL LAST WEEK, THE U.S. CONGRESS DISCUSSED GIVING MORE AID TO THE CONTRAS. NO ONE EVEN WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE CONTRAS, IT WAS A STALE ISSUE. HOWEVER, IT HAS BECOME A BURNING ISSUE OVERNIGHT AND EVERYBODY IS NOW TALKING ABOUT AID FOR THE CONTRAS AND EVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF GIVING MILITARY AID TO THEM. LAST NIGHT, THE U.S. SENATE ISSUED A RESOLUTION STRONGLY CONDENMING THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT. MY QUESTIONS ARE: FIRST, WHY HAS THERE BEEN SUCH A SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED CHANGE. SECOND, WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO THE U.S. CONGRESS. U.S. CONGRESSMEN ARE ONLY CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR REELECTION. WITH THE DUE RESPECT THAT SOME OF THEM DESERVE, U.S. CONGRESSMEN ARE ONLY WORRIED ABOUT THEIR REELECTION. I HAVE TALKED TO MANY OF THEM HERE AND THEY ARE CYNICAL. THEY TELL ME: I DISAGREE WITH THAT BUT I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THOSE WHO ELECTED ME. IF THOSE WHO ELECTED ME HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION, THEN I HAVE TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR THEIR VIEWPOINTS AND FORGET ABOUT MY OWN OPINION. LET US NOT MISLEAD OURSELVES. YOU KNOW VERY WELL HOW U.S. CONGRESSMEN ACT. THEREFORE, IT WAS EASIER FOR THEM TO SIMPLY APPROVE FUNDS FOR THE CONTRAS AS THEY HAD DONE -- BECAUSE THE CONGRESS HAD APPROVED THE SO-CALLED HUMANITARIAN AID FOR THE CONTRAS AND LET THE WAR CONTINUE, AND LEAVE THE BURDEN ON THE CENTRAL AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS, ESPECIALLY ON THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING THE EFFECTS OF THIS WAR. THEREFORE, WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING THE KILLINGS, THE ASSASSINATIONS, THE CRIMES, THE CONTRAS ATTACKS, AND THE YANKEE CONGRESS HAS REMAINED SILENT. THEREFORE, WE SEE AN EASY-GOING ATTITUDE IN THE U.S. CONGRESS. OBVIOUSLY, WHEN WE ANNOUNCE WE ARE NOT GOING TO EXTEND THE CEASE-FIRE THE U.S. CONGRESS REACTS IMMEDIATELY. THEY REACT BECAUSE THEY ARE FULLY AWARE THAT THEY ARE MEDDLING IN NICARAGUAN POLITICS. THEY WILL HAVE TO RESUME DISCUSSIONS ON THE NICARAGUAN ISSUE, AND THEY DO NOT WANT TO DISCUSS THE NICARAGUAN ISSUE AGAIN. IT WAS EASY TO SET ASIDE THE NICARAGUAN ISSUE AND TO SIMPLY APPROVE FUNDS FOR THE CONTRAS SO THE CONTRAS COULD CONTINUE KILLING NICARAGUANS WHILE EVERYTHING ELSE REMAINS CALM -- LET THE PEACE PLAN CONTINUE AS FAR AS IT CAN AND AS FAR AS PRESIDENT BUSH ALLOWS IT TO DEVELOP. THE U.S. CONGRESSMEN CAN THEN FORGET ABOUT THE NICARAGUAN ISSUE AND WORK ON OTHER DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL ISSUES IN WHICH THEY ARE MORE INTERESTED. HOWEVER, WHEN NICARAGUA SAYS: WE WILL NOT EXTEND THE CEASE-FIRE, THEN THEY RAISE AN OUTCRY. WHY DO THEY RAISE AN OUTCRY? BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY WILL HAVE TO RESUME DISCUSSIONS ON THE NICARAGUAN ISSUE. MOREOVER, THERE MIGHT BE A FEVERISH CONGRESSMAN WHO WILL PROPOSE GIVING MILITARY AID TO THE CONTRAS. WELL, LET THEM DISCUSS MILITARY AID. DO THEY WANT TO DISCUSS MILITARY AID, WELL THAT IS THEIR PROBLEM. WE SIMPLY BELIEVE THAT THE WAY THE YANKEE CONGRESS ACTIONS WILL EASE OR HINDER THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTIONS ON 25 FEBRUARY WILL DEPEND NOW ON THE YANKEE CONGRESS AND ON THE YANKEE PRESIDENT. IT WILL DEPEND ON THEM. WE HAVE THE DESIRE TO DO IT. HOWEVER, WHETHER OR NOT THE ELECTIONS ARE HELD ON 25 FEBRUARY WILL DEPEND ON THEM.

ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL REPORT, THE MILITARIZATION OF LIMA WAS DECLARED AT THE SAME TIME A GROUP OF 100 HOODED SHINING PATH ACTIVITS STAGED A DEMONSTRATION, ENGAGED IN A SHOOT-OUT, AND HURLED EXPLOSIVES AT THE POLICE IN LA VICTORIA DISTRICT.

ACCORDING TO A DECREE, THE ARMED FORCES WILL TAKE CONTROL OF LIMA DEPARTMENT AND EL CALLAO PROVINCE, NEXT TO THE CAPITAL, WHERE A STATE OF EMERGENCY IS IN FORCE. ON 23 OCTOBER, THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT EXTENDED FOR 1 MONTH THE STATE OF EMERGENCY IN LIMA DUE TO AN OUTBURST OF THE POLITICAL VIOLENCE THAT HAS RESULTED IN MORE THAN 350 DEATHS NATIONWIDE LAST MONTH. DESPITE THE STATE OF EMERGENCY, WHICH SUSPENDS IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES, UNTIL TODAY INTERNAL ORDER WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE NATIONAL POLICE. PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA TODAY TOLD THE MEDIA THAT THE POLICE ARRESTED 149 PEOPLE, OF WHOM ABOUT 100 ARE ALLEGED SHINING PATH MEMBERS, DURING TODAY'S RIOTS. THE PERUVIAN CHIEF OF STATE SAID THAT THE RIOTS WERE MEANT "TO HINDER" THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR 12 NOVEMBER. HE ADDED THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION WILL EXERT "ALL THE NECESSARY ENERGY TO COMBAT SUBVERSION." THE SHINING PATH MEMBERS TODAY DEMONSTRATED WITH SHOUTS FAVORING THE "ARMED STRUGGLE," AND THEY HANDED OUT LEAFLETS CALLING ON THE PEOPLE TO ENGAGE IN AN "ARMED STRIKE" ON 3 NOVEMBER. THE SHINING PATH, WHICH HAS BEEN ENGAGING IN WARFARE FOR THE PAST 10 YEARS, INTENDS TO PARALYZE LIMA WITH THE "ARMED STRIKE" -- A GENERAL STRIKE UNDER ARMED COERCION -- ONLY 9 DAYS BEFORE THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS. THE "SHINING PATH" HAS ALSO ANNOUNCED IT INTENDS TO BOYCOTT THE ELECTIONS LEADER OF THE ORGANIZATION, ABIMAEL GUZMAN. THE MAIN PERUVIAN POLITICAL PARTIES, THE CHURCH, AND LABOR AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE CALLED, FOR THE SAME DAY, A DEMONSTRATION IN FAVOR OF PEACE AND IN DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY, WHICH IS CONSIDERED TO BE THREATENED BY TERRORISM. THE "SHINING PATH" HAS INTENSIFIED ITS ARMED ACTIVITIES NATIONWIDE DUE TO THE 12 NOVEMBER MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS. AS A RESULT, HUNDREDS OF CANDIDATES HAVE WITHDRAWN FROM THE RACE. IN ITS PROCLAMATIONS, THE "SHINING PATH" THREATENED "TO ANNIHILATE, SOONER OF LATER" ALL CANDIDATES WHO RUN IN THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS. THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS ARE BEING HELD JUST 6 MONTHS BEFORE THE PRESIDENTIAL AND CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS, WHICH ARE SCHEDULED FOR 8 APRIL 1990.
DEV-MUC3-0633	SAN SALVADOR, 1 NOV 89 -- FOR THE THIRD DAY IN A ROW, THE BLOODBATH CONTINUES TO ROCK THIS CAPITAL CITY AND THE END TO THIS SITUATION, WHICH IS ALARMING THE PEOPLE, DOES NOT SEEM TO BE NEAR. ACCORDING TO REPORTS, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT URBAN COMMANDS FAILED ONCE AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON WHEN THEY ATTACKED THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE LOCATED IN LAICO NEIGHBORHOOD. THE FMLN URBAN COMMANDS FIRED TWO RPG-2 ROCKET LAUNCHERS WHICH HIT A PRIVATE VEHICLE WITH LICENSE PLATE 72246 THAT WAS PASSING THE MILITARY GARRISON. AS A RESULT OF THE REBEL ATTACK, AN AGRONOMIST, IDENTIFIED AS 57- YEAR- OLD JOSE HERMOGENES MARTINEZ, WAS KILLED. WE DID NOT TAKE PICTURES OF HIS BODY BECAUSE IT WAS TOTALLY MUTILATED AS A RESULT OF THE STRONG EXPLOSION. ALSO INJURED WAS A STREET VENDOR IDENTIFIED AS MARIA DEL CARMEN PEREZ. THERE WERE FOUR MEN IN A PICKUP, TWO SEATED IN FRONT AND TWO IN THE BACK. THE TWO WHO WERE IN THE BACK TOOK OUT THE BAZOOKAS AND FIRED ON THE GARRISON'S GATE. A MAN DRIVING A SUZUKI DROVE AT THE SAME TIME THE ROCKETS WERE LAUNCHED AND HE WAS HIT. HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE IN THE VEHICLE? FOUR. THE CAR WHERE THE INJURED MAN WAS? ONLY ONE PERSON, THE MAN WHO WAS INJURED. HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE IN THE VEHICLE FROM WHERE THE ROCKETS WHERE FIRED? FOUR PERSONS. AT WHAT TIME DID THAT HAPPEN? ABOUT 30 MINUTES AGO, AT APPROXIMATELY 1530. HOW MANY ROCKETS WERE FIRED? TWO. THE MAN WAS IN THE CAR. AFTER THE DEVICES EXPLODED -- WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT KIND WERE FIRED -- THERE WAS SMOKE AND GUNPOWDER ALL OVER THE PLACE. HIS CLOTHES AND BODY WERE TOTALLY DESTROYED. WHEN WE TOOK HIM TO THE ROSALES HOSPITAL WE TALKED TO A DOCTOR, AND HE SAID THAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO ALL THEY COULD TO SAVE HIS LIFE. MEANWHILE, COLONEL FRANCISCO ELENA FUENTES, COMMANDER OF THE MILITARY GARRISON, REGRETTED THE ATTACK AND SAID THAT THESE ATTACKS ARE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE VIOLENCE UNLEASHED IN THE PAST FEW DAYS BY GROUPS THAT ARE OUT OF CONTROL. YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE VEHICLE. WE BELIEVE THE ROCKETS WERE AIMED AT THE GATE, AT THE GUARDS STANDING AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE HEADQUARTERS. PERHAPS THEY WERE AIMED AT ME BECAUSE I HAD BEEN IN THE AREA 5 MINUTES EARLIER. THOSE PEOPLE ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF THEIR MINDS. THEY DO NOT CARE IF THE KILL INNOCENT CIVILIANS. THESE COULD BE GROUPS THAT THE FMLN CAN NO LONGER CONTROL OR PERHAPS THEY ARE ONLY KILLERS WHO ONLY KNOW HOW TO MURDER PEOPLE. THE INJURED PERSONS WERE TAKEN TO ROSALES HOSPITAL IN SAN SALVADOR WHERE THEY WERE GIVEN EMERGENCY TREATMENT. THE STREET VENDOR SAYS THAT IT WAS A MIRACLE THAT SHE WAS NOT KILLED. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. I WAS JUST SITTING THERE AND I HEARD THE NOISE . MEANWHILE, THE FMLN URBAN GUERRILLAS SET FIRE TO A PUBLIC BUSH IN SANTA MARTA, SAN JACINTON NEIGHBORHOOD. THE REBELS DISTRIBUTED LEAFLETS STATING THAT THEY BURNED THE BUS IN REPRISAL FOR THE KILLING OF LEFTIST LEADER FEDE ELIZABETH VELASQUEZ.
DEV-MUC3-0634	MANAGUA , 2 NOV 89 -- THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT TODAY CONDEMNED THE DYNAMITE ATTACK ON THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION . A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE PRESIDENCY ACCUSES THE DEATH SQUADS OF PERPETRATING THE 31 OCTOBER ATTACK IN WHICH A POWERFUL BOMB EXPLODED AT THE FENASTRAS HEADQUARTERS KILLING NINE PEOPLE, INCLUDING THE WELL-KNOWN UNION LEADER ELIZABETH VELAZQUEZ. THIS TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS, WHICH REVIVES RECENT HISTORY IN THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRY, PROVES THE CRIMINAL NATURE OF THE ULTRARIGHT-WING FORCES SERVING IMPERIALIST INTERESTS, AND REVEALS THEIR TRUE INTENTIONS, DESPITE THEIR HYPOCRITICAL STATEMENTS ABOUT DESIRING PEACE, FREEDOM, AND DEMOCRACY, THE DOCUMENT STATES. THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS THAT THIS AND OTHER CRIMES OBLIGE THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT TO DEFEND ITS PEOPLE'S HUMAN RIGHTS AND TO FIND AND PUNISH THOSE WHO ARE GUILTY. SHORTLY AFTER THE ATTACK, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT SAID THAT IT WAS CARRIED OUT IN RESPONSE TO THE 30 OCTOBER GUERRILLA ATTACK ON THE ARMY'S GENERAL STAFF HEADQUARTERS.
DEV-MUC3-0635	SAN SALVADOR, 2 NOV 89 -- THE GUERRILLAS' ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY THAT THEY DECIDED TO SUSPEND THEIR DIALOGUE WITH THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT CAUSED GREAT SURPRISE AMONG VARIOUS CIRCLES IN THE COUNTRY THAT VOWED TO MAKE NEW EFFORTS TO REESTABLISH THEM. THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT SUSPENDED ITS DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI TO PROTEST A DYNAMITE ATTACK ON THE HEADQUARTERS OF A LABOR UNION ON 31 OCTOBER THAT LEFT 10 DEAD AND 30 INJURED. ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLAS, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DYNAMITE ATTACK ON THE SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION . THE FMLN, IN A COMMUNIQUE SIGNED BY ITS TOP FIVE LEADERS, STATED THAT "WE MUST NOT ALLOW OUR PRESENCE IN THE DIALOGUE TO BE USED TO COVER UP THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT MASSACRE." IT ALSO DEMANDED THAT THE OAS, UNITED NATIONS, AND THE CHURCH OFFER GUARANTEES TO EL SALVADOR'S OPPOSITION GROUPS. REVEREND EDGAR PALACIOS, COORDINATOR OF THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE FOR THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE , WHICH IS MADE UP OF OVER 60 SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS, TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT "WE REGRET THIS KIND OF DECISION VERY MUCH, BUT WE WILL IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THE GUERRILLAS TO TRY TO RESUME THE DIALOGUE." PALACIOS ADDED THAT "IF THE DOOR OF DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION IS CLOSED, THE DOOR OF WAR WILL OPEN." EDUARDO COLINDRES, LEADER OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THE MAIN OPPOSITION PARTY, SAID THAT THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS "MUST CONTINUE." "THE GOVERNMENT OF THE RIGHTIST NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE MUST INVESTIGATE AND PUNISH THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIME COMMITTED AGAINST FENASTRAS; HOWEVER, THE DIALOGUE MUST NOT BE SUSPENDED," COLINDRES ADDED. JUAN JOSE MARTEL, LEADER OF THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT , WHICH IS A MEMBER OF THE LEFTIST DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE, EXPRESSED SURPRISE OVER THE GUERRILLAS' DECISION. MARTEL SAID THAT RIGHT-WING SALVADORAN GROUPS ARE TRYING TO ELIMINATE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS, WHICH SEEKS TO END THE WAR THROUGH NEGOTIATED POLITICAL MEANS. SO FAR, NO GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN HAS REACTED TO THE FMLN'S DECISION TO SUSPEND THE DIALOGUE THAT BEGAN IN MID-SEPTEMBER AND WOULD HAVE CONTINUED ON 20 AND 21 NOVEMBER IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA. PALACIOS, ALONG WITH OTHER RELIGIOUS, POLITICAL, AND LABOR LEADERS, HEADED A MARCH TO ACCOMPANY THE BODIES OF 10 WORKERS WHO WERE KILLED DURING THE DYNAMITE ATTACK ON THE FENASTRAS HEADQUARTERS IN DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR, ONLY 200 METERS FROM A NATIONAL POLICE GARRISON. THE UNION MEMBERS' BODIES, INCLUDING THAT OF FENASTRAS LEADER FEBE ELIZABETH VELASQUEZ, WERE ACCOMPANIED BY SEVERAL THOUSAND WORKERS WHO SHOUTED ANTIGOVERNMENT SLOGANS AND CARRIED RED FLOWERS. TENSION WAS HIGH DURING THE MARCH, MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE HEAVY MILITARY PRESENCE IN SAN SALVADOR'S MAIN STREETS AND BECAUSE THE UNION MEMBERS DETAINED AT LEAST 30 PLAINCLOTHES POLICEMEN WHO, ACCORDING TO THE UNIONISTS, INFILTRATED THE DEMONSTRATION. THE MARCH ENDED AT THE GENERAL CEMETERY WHERE THE BODIES OF THE UNION MEMBERS WERE BURIED.
DEV-MUC3-0636	SAN JOSE , 3 NOV 89 -- VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ AND COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS ARE WORKING HARD SO THAT THE BREAK IN THE TALKS BETWEEN THE GUERILLAS AND THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WILL BE ONLY TEMPORARY. ARIAS TODAY IN SAN JOSE ANNOUNCED THAT ON 6 NOVEMBER HE WILL MEET IN SAN JOSE WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SALVADORAN REBELS, ADDING THAT HE HAD TALKED WITH PRESIDENT PEREZ REGARDING THE NEED TO "CALL ON THE PARTIES INVOLVED TO MAINTAIN THEIR WILLINGNESS TO TALK." THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT, WHO DID NOT DISCLOSE THE TIME AND PLACE OF HIS MEETING WITH THE REBELS,, SAID THAT HIS GOAL IS TO "URGE THEM TO PROMISE THAT THE SUSPENSION OF THE DIALOGUE WILL ONLY BE TEMPORARY." ARIAS, 1987 NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNER FOR HIS PEACEMAKING EFFORTS IN CENTRAL AMERICA, ADMITTED, HOWEVER, THAT "PERHAPS THIS IS NOT THE BEST TIME FOR THE TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT TO BE RESUMED." IN THE PAST 8 DAYS IN EL SALVADOR, THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL ATTACKS ON MILITARY INSTALLATIONS AND LABOR UNION HEADQUARTERS, DURING WHICH 10 PERSONS WERE KILLED AND MANY INJURED. THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS DECIDED TO SUSPEND THE TALKS WITH THE GOVERNMENT -- THE FIRST ROUND OF TALKS HELD IN MEXICO CITY IN SEPTEMBER AND THE SECOND ROUND IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, IN OCTOBER -- FOLLOWING THE 31 OCTOBER ATTACK ON A LABOR UNION HEADQUARTERS IN SAN SALVADOR THAT RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF 10 LABOR LEADERS. "I VIEW THIS INTERRUPTION OF THE DIALOGUE WITH GREAT SADDNESS AND REGRET; HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ONLY A STUMBLING BLOCK IN A PEACE PROCESS THAT IS NOT A VERY EASY ONE," THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT SAID. PRESIDENT ARIAS SAID THAT HE HAD ASKED HIS VENEZUELAN COLLEAGUE -- WHO WAS TO HAVE HOSTED THE NEXT ROUND OF TALKS BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN -- TO JOIN IN HIS EFFORTS TO URGE THE PARTIES INVOLVED TO MAINTAIN THEIR WILLINGNESS TO TALK "WHEN THE SITUATION IMPROVES." "ON THE PATH FOR PEACE THERE WILL BE TIMES WHEN STEPS BACKWARDS ARE TAKEN -- LIKE THE ONE CURRENTLY BEING TAKEN IN EL SALVADOR AND PREVIOUSLY IN NICARAGUA," PRESIDENT ARIAS SAID IN ALLUSION TO THE DECISION MADE BY NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA'S GOVERNMENT NOT TO EXTEND THE CEASE-FIRE WITH THE CONTRAS.
DEV-MUC3-0637	SAN SALVADOR, 3 NOV 89 -- SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI TODAY ANNOUNCED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WILL ATTEND THE MEETING WITH THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS SCHEDULED FOR 20 NOVEMBER IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA, DESPITE THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S DECISION TO SUSPEND THE DIALOGUE. CRISTIANI DISCLOSED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL INVESTIGATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ATTACK THAT KILLED 10 TRADE UNION MEMBERS ON 31 OCTOBER, WHICH THE FMLN HAS BLAMED ON ARMY AND GOVERNMENT SECTORS. ON THAT DATE, THE FMLN DECIDED TO SUSPEND THE DIALOGUE THAT HAD BEGAN ON 17 OCTOBER IN COSTA RICA. HOWEVER, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT REJECTED "THE IRRESPONSIBLE AND MALICIOUS ACCUSATIONS MADE BY THE FMLN THAT THE ATTACK HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT BY THE ARMED FORCES WITH THE AUTHORIZATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC." AFTER SUSPENDING THE DIALOGUE, THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS ASKED THE UNITED NATIONS, THE OAS, AND THE SALVADORAN CATHOLIC CHURCH "FOR GUARANTEES FOR OPPOSITION ORGANIZATIONS." THE PRESIDENTS OF COSTA RICA AND VENEZUELA, OSCAR ARIAS AND CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, RESPECTIVELY, TODAY OFFERED THEIR MEDIATION TO GET THE DIALOGUE UNDER WAY.
DEV-MUC3-0638	SAN SALVADOR, 4 NOV 89 -- VICE PRESIDENT FRANCISCO MERINO SAYS THAT THE GUERRILLAS ARE HURTING THEMSELVES BY CARRYING OUT ATTACKS SUCH AS THE ONE PERPETRATED RECENTLY. HE SAID THE REBELS ARE ACTING LIKE OSTRICHES BY HIDING THEIR HEADS UNDER THE SAND. LOGICALLY THAT IS NO SOLUTION. THEY MUST REALIZE THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE REJECTED THEM. THE PEOPLE CONDEMN ALL OF THESE ACTIONS. THE LATEST ATTACKS ARE HURTING THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT ITSELF. THEY HAVE BEEN ISOLATED INTERNATIONALLY, THE PEOPLE HAVE REJECTED THEM, AND THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMY ARE FULFULLING THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE. THEREFORE, THEY MUST CONTINUE WITH THE TALKS AND PARTICIPATE IN THEM SERIOUSLY BY REACHING AGREEMENTS THAT CAN BRING PEACE TO ALL. THE TERRORIST AGGRESSION MAKES NO SENSE. WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION? WILL IT CONTINUE WITH THE TALKS? WILL IT GO TO THE TALKS EVEN IF THE GUERRILLA COMMANDERS DO NOT ATTEND? THE GOVERNMENT DEFINITELY HAS A COMMITMENT TO THE PEOPLE. IT IS A COMMITMENT THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE. BESIDES OUR WILLINGNESS TO ACHIEVE PEACE WE ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO THESE TALKS. WE WILL CONTINUE ON THIS ROAD. IT IS CERTAINLY A DIFFICULT ROAD BUT WE MUST CONTINUE ON IT. I BELIEVE THAT THE SAN JOSE MEETING LIKE THE ONE IN CARACAS, AND MAYBE OTHERS AFTER THAT, HAS BEEN QUITE DIFFICULT. HOWEVER, WE HAVE DISCUSSED ALL THE PROBLEMS AND THE GUERRILLAS WILL LOGICALLY REACH THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE. THEY ASK FOR GUARANTEES FOR LABOR ORGANIZATIONS. I BELIEVE WE CANNOT GIVE THEM MORE GUARANTEES THAN THE ONES WE HAVE ALREADY GIVEN THEM. THERE IS A GENERAL FEELING THAT THESE PEOPLE ONLY UNDERSTAND STRONG ACTIONS. HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT HAS REVIEWED THE SITUATION QUITE WELL, AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO FALL INTO THAT TRAP OR MAKE THAT MISTAKE. OTHERWISE, WE WOULD GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACCUSE THE GOVERNMENT. WE WILL LOGICALLY BE PRUDENT. VICE PRESIDENT MERINO SAID THAT DESPITE THE DIFFICULTIES THE GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE. THE FMLN GUERRILLAS WITHDREW FROM THE TALKS AND DEMANDED SECURITY FOR LABOR UNION ORGANIZATIONS FOLLOWING THE ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS , IN WHICH 10 LABOR UNION MEMBERS WERE KILLED, INCLUDING OPPOSITION LEADER ELIZABETH VELAZQUEZ. NEXT WEEK, GUERRILLA LEADERS WILL MEET IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA WITH PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS TO SEEK SOLUTIONS TO THE COMPLEX SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR.
DEV-MUC3-0639	SAN SALVADOR, 3 NOV 89 -- CONCERNING THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HEREBY ANNOUNCES THE FOLLOWING: 1. ON THE DAY OF THE TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS , THE GOVERNMENT STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE ATTACK AND ANNOUNCED ITS PLANS TO CARRY OUT A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION. HOWEVER, IT IS REGRETTABLE THAT FENASTRAS LEADERS HAVE BEEN HINDERING THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT COULD CLEAR UP THE ATTACK. NONETHELESS, THE GOVERNMENT REITERATES ITS DETERMINATION TO CARRY OUT A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION, AND WILL EVEN BRING TO THE COUNTRY SOME EXPERTS IN THIS FIELD SO THAT WITH THE HELP OF MODERN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY THEY WILL HELP THE INVESTIGATIVE COMMITTEE CLARIFY THIS BLOODY AND CRIMINAL ATTACK AND ESTABLISH WHO IS RESPONSIBLE. LIKEWISE, THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO APPOINT A COMMISSION THAT WILL GUARANTEE THE INVESTIGATIONS, AND IT WILL INVITE THE FOLLOWING: ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE UNITED NATIONS; ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE OAS; ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE SALVADORAN BISHOPS' CONFERENCE; ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE POLITICAL PARTIES; TWO LABOR UNION REPRESENTATIVES, ONE OF THEM BEING FROM FENASTRAS; DR IGNACIO ELLACURIA ; THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE REPUBLIC; AND THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE. 2. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS SUPPLIED EVIDENCE FROM THE BEGINNING THAT IT IS SINCERELY SEEKING PEACE. THE DIALOGUE COMMISSION ATTENDED A FIRST MEETING WITH THE FMLN IN MEXICO, AND ACCEPTED A COMMITMENT, AS FOLLOWS, AND I QUOTE: BOTH PARTIES COMMIT THEMSELVES NOT TO WITHDRAW UNILATERALLY FROM THE DIALOGUE. THE FMLN'S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE DIALOGUE IS NOT ONLY A VIOLATION OF THE MEXICO AGREEMENT, BUT ALSO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S HOPES FOR PEACE. FAR FROM SUSPENDING THE DIALOGUE, THE FMLN SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE SEARCH FOR PEACE IS NOW MORE NECESSARY THAN EVER IN ORDER TO HALT THE BLOODSHED. 3. EVIDENTLY, IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS ONE, THE ENEMIES OF PEACE ARE TRYING TO MAKE THE DIALOGUE FAIL. THE RECENT TERRORIST ACTIONS ARE AN INSULT TO THE CIVILIZED MECHANISMS THAT HAVE COME UP AT THE NEGOTIATIONS TABLE. THE GOVERNMENT HEREBY NOTIFIES THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT THE DIALOGUE COMMISSION WILL CONTINUE TO DO ITS WORK, AND IT WILL NOT WITHDRAW FROM THE TALKS IN SPITE OF THE SORROWFUL EVENTS THAT HAVE BROUGHT MORE MOURNING TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE IN RECENT DAYS. 4. IN THESE DIFFICULT MOMENTS THAT OUR COUNTRY IS EXPERIENCING, THE GOVERNMENT REITERATES ITS CALL FOR THE PEOPLE TO REMAIN CALM, SO THAT IN A PRUDENT AND UNDERSTANDING MANNER WE WILL JOIN EFFORTS TO HELP REACH PEACE AND NOT PROMOTE VIOLENCE, WHICH ONLY SERVES TO HINDER THE DIALOGUE. SAN SALVADOR, 3 NOVEMBER 1989
DEV-MUC3-0640	CLANDESTINE, 4 NOV 89 -- COMMANDER LEONEL GONZALEZ, ON FRIDAY NIGHT MR ALFREDO CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED SOME MEASURES WHICH THE GOVERNMENT WILL ADOPT IN CONNECTION WITH FENASTRAS AND THE DIALOGUE. THE FMLN ANNOUNCED IT HAD SUSPENDED ITS TRIP TO CARACAS, BUT CRISTIANI SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION WILL GO TO CARACAS REGARDLESS OF OUR DECISION. WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION? IN MY OPINION, TWO POSITIONS ON THE DIALOGUE AND THE NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS WERE MADE EVIDENT IN SAN JOSE. THE GOVERNMENT OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND VIEW THE DIALOGUE AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TALKING, BUYING TIME, AND BUILDING A GOOD IMAGE FOR THEMSELVES. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE FMLN IS WORKING FOR A REAL NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS. THE FMLN HAS OPENED A BROADER DEBATE, A DEBATE THAT INCLUDES DISCUSSIONS WITH AND THE PARTICIPATION OF POLITICAL PARTIES, THE SOCIAL FORCES, THE CHURCH, ALL THE SECTORS. WE HAVE INITIATED A NATIONAL DIALOGUE. AS WE SEE IT, THE GOAL IS PART OF A WHOLE, IT IS NOT EVERYTHING. THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF ALLOWING THE PARTICIPATION OF THE SOCIAL FORCES IS IMPORTANT ALSO. IN RECENT DAYS WE HAVE SEEN ACTIONS UNPRECEDENTED IN THE HISTORY OF EL SALVADOR. THERE WAS THE ATTACK ON WORKERS IN WHICH 10 WORKERS DIED AND 31 WERE INJURED. THE FMLN CANNOT IGNORE THIS FACT. THIS IS PART OF THE PROCESS. WE HAVE SAID THAT WE ARE GOING TO ESTABLISH CONTACT WITH OBSERVERS AND MEDIATORS TO ANALYZE THE SITUATION, AND WE WILL DISCUSS THIS PROCESS WITH THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND THE SOCIAL FORCES. WHAT WE WANT IS TO CONSOLIDATE THE NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS. WE ARE NOT TRYING TO ENHANCE OUR IMAGE; OUR PEOPLE KNOW WHO IS TELLING THE TRUTH. IN SAN JOSE WE MADE A SOLUTION PROPOSAL THAT ENVISAGES DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND A PROCESS TO FIND A WAY OUT OF THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT. ON MONDAY AND WEDNESDAY OF NEXT WEEK WE ARE GOING TO MEET IN WASHINGTON WITH OAS AND UN REPRESENTATIVES. ALSO ON MONDAY IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, WE COULD BE IN CONTACT WITH THE COSTA RICAN GOVERNMENT TO ANALYZE THE SITUATION. WE WILL ANALYZE DEVELOPMENTS TO DETERMINE THE POSITION OF THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT. IF ACTIONS BY THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT CLOSE THE POSSIBILITIES OF CARACAS, THEN WE WILL ADOPT MEASURES. WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS TO ANNOUNCE A SUSPENSION TO CREATE CONDITIONS FOR MAKING PROGRESS TOWARD REAL NEGOTIATIONS, AS THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENTS ESTABLISH. THEN WHY IS THE GOVERNMENT GOING TO CARACAS, COMMANDER? I BELIEVE THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATION GOING TO CARACAS IS AIMED AT ENHANCING THE GOVERNMENT'S IMAGE, AT CREATING A SMOKE SCREEN AROUND THE MASSACRE COMMITTED AGAINST THE POPULAR MOVEMENT. NOW THAT YOU MENTION THE FENASTRAS MASSACRE, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE CREATION OF A COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THIS CASE THAT CRISTIANI HAS ANNOUNCED? ONE OF THE POINTS OF OUR SAN JOSE PROPOSAL CALLS FOR CHANGING THE SALVADORAN LEGAL SYSTEM BECAUSE IT IS VITIATED AND IS IN THE HANDS OF ONE SINGLE PARTY. SO, IN THIS FRAMEWORK, CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION IS LIKE PUTTING THE CASE INSIDE A FORGOTTEN DRAWER. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MONSIGNOR ROMERO CASE, THE CASE OF THE REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT LEADERS, AND THE CASES OF THOUSANDS OF WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN MURDERED AND WHOSE CASES HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN. THE PURPOSE OF THIS COMMISSION IS TO CREATE A SMOKE SCREEN AROUND THE GRAVE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS BEING COMMITTED BY THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN INVITED TO FORM PART OF THIS COMMISSION SHOULD NOT LEND THEMSELVES TO PLAYING A PART IN THE EFFORT TO HIDE WHAT IS REALLY BEHIND ALL THIS. WHAT THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT WANTS IS TO DIVERT AWAY FROM EMILIO PONCE ALL THE ACCUSATIONS AND CHARGES, AND PONCE IS THE ONE WHO IS DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THIS KIND OF ATTACK. THE STATE POLICY OF THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT IS REPRESSION, AND THIS STATE POLICY IS BEING IMPLEMENTED BY THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT, CRISTIANI, AND THE HIGH COMMAND, AND THEY ARE DOING IT THROUGH THE REPRESSIVE BODIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY FUNCTION AS CIVILIANS, AS DEATH SQUADS, OR IN UNIFORM.
DEV-MUC3-0641	SAN SALVADOR, 2 NOV 89 -- COLONEL FRANCISCO ELENA FUENTES, COMMANDER OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE, IN ANALYZING RECENT ACTS OF VIOLENCE IN SAN SALVADOR, HAS REPORTED THAT GROUPS OUT OF THE CONTROL OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT - REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT ALLIANCE COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MOST RECENT ACTS OF VIOLENCE. THE MILITARY COMMANDER WAS CAREFUL IN MAKING HIS STATEMENT. HE SAID THAT HE HAS NO EVIDENCE THAT THOSE GROUPS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXPLOSIONS IN THE SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION AND COMADRES [COMMITTEE OF MOTHERS AND RELATIVES OF THE PAST, THE ARMY HAS BEEN BLAMED, AND LATER IT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED THAT FMLN TERRORISTS HAD CARRIED THEM OUT. ELENA FUENTES RECALLED THAT A FEW DAYS AGO THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION ON THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY CAMPUS AND HE WENT THERE AND IT WAS ESTABLISHED IN FRONT OF STUDENT LEADERS THAT THE EXPLOSION WAS CAUSED BY A GRENADE THAT WENT OFF IN THE HANDS OF A YOUNG LEFTIST WHO WAS HANDLING IT. BY THEN, HOWEVER, STATEMENTS HAD ALREADY BEEN MADE ACCUSING THE MILITARY. ELENA FUENTES ALSO REFERRED TO INTERNAL PURGES WITHIN COMMUNIST GROUPS, PURGES LIKE THE CASE OF MELIDA ANAYA MONTES, ALIAS COMMANDER MARIA; SALVADOR CAYETANO CARPIO, ALIAS MARCIAL; AND OTHERS. HE SAID: "IT WOULD NOT BE STRANGE TO FIND THAT THESE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN THE RESULT OF A PURGE OR A DIVERSIONARY TACTIC BY THE COMMUNISTS TO ATTRACT POLITICAL ATTENTION AND GAIN THE PEOPLE'S SUPPORT, WHICH EVERYBODY BELIEVES THEY ARE LOSING." IT WAS RECALLED, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THAT THE NAME OF ONE OF THE VICTIMS OF THE FENASTRAS ATTACK, FEBE ELIZABETH VELASQUEZ, WAS MENTIONED IN THE INVESTIGATIONS BEING CARRIED OUT BY INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS OVER THE EMBEZZLEMENT OF AID FROM EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THAT WAS TO BENEFIT THE MOST NEEDY PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY, BUT THAT ENDED UP IN THE HANDS OF TERRORIST GROUPS TO BE USED FOR TERRORIST PURPOSES. ELENA FUENTES STATED: "TIME AND INVESTIGATIONS WILL TELL WHAT REALLY HAPPENED." HE SAID THAT THE PURPOSE OF THESE ATTACKS, ESPECIALLY THE ONE ON THE DEFENSE MINISTRY, FOR WHICH THE FMLN - FDR CLAIMED CREDIT, AS WELL AS THE ATTACKS ON COMADRES AND FENASTRAS, WAS TO GIVE THE FMLN - FDR LEADERSHIP JUSTIFICATION TO WITHDRAW FROM THE DIALOGUE. ELENA FUENTES SAID THAT THE TERRORIST GUADALUPE MARTINEZ SAID IN MANAGUA YESTERDAY THAT THE LEFTIST LEADERSHIP IS CONSIDERING NOT GOING TO THE DIALOGUE MEETINGS BECAUSE OF THE ATTACKS.
DEV-MUC3-0642	SAN SALVADOR, 5 NOV 89 -- IT HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THIS CAPITAL THAT A DELEGATION OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT WILL MEET THIS WEEK IN WASHINGTON WITH UN AND OAS REPRESENTATIVES TO ANALYZE THE COUNTRY'S SITUATION AND THE FUTURE OF THE TALKS BETWEEN THE REBELS AND ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S ADMINISTRATION. COMMANDER LEONEL GONZALEZ, ONE OF THE FIVE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND MEMBERS, ISSUED A STATEMENT THROUGH RADIO VENCEREMOS -- THE OFFICIAL VOICE OF THE GUERRILLA ORGANIZATIONS -- AND SAID THAT THE MEETINGS WILL START TOMORROW 6 NOVEMBER. OTHER FMLN DELEGATES WILL MEET TOMORROW WITH COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS, WHO HAS STATED HIS CONCERN REGARDING THE TALKS BETWEEN THE REBELS AND CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AFTER RIGHT-WING SQUADS ASSASSINATED 10 LABOR LEADERS. COMMANDER GONZALEZ SAID "THAT THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION'S DOUBLE-FACED CONDUCT IS PRECLUDING THE POSSIBILITIES FOR ACHIEVING A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT." "THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION AND THE ARMY OPPOSE REAL NEGOTIATIONS, AND THEIR CONCEPT OF A DIALOGUE IS TO TALK AND TALK -- BUT ONLY TO GAIN TIME AND PROJECT A GOOD IMAGE AT THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVEL," THE REBEL LEADER SAID. REFERRING TO THIS, GONZALEZ ASSERTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO SEND ITS DELEGATION TO THE 20-21 NOVEMBER MEETING IN CARACAS, WHETHER THE GUERRILLA REPRESENTATIVES ATTEND IT OR NOT, IS AIMED AT "CREATING A SMOKE SCREEN TO COVER THE MASSACRES PERPETRATED THIS WEEK AGAINST THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT." COMMANDER GONZALEZ ALSO REFERRED TO CRISTIANI'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT A COMMISSION WILL BE CREATED WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF UN AND OAS DELEGATES TO INVESTIGATE THE 10 LABOR LEADERS' MASSACRE. "IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT AN INVESTIGATION WITH A CORRUPT JUDICIAL SYSTEM LIKE THE ONE IN EL SALVADOR ," GONZALEZ SAID. HE RECALLED THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SOLVE THE MURDER OF SAN SALVADOR ARCHBISHOP OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO IN 10 YEARS. THE GUERRILLA BLAMES MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON, ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT PARTY'S IDEOLOGISTS, FOR ROMERO'S MURDER. THE FMLN COMMANDER ALSO WARNED THAT THE ARMY "HAS LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN TO CONFUSE NATIONAL AND WORLD OPINION BY ACCUSING THE GUERRILLAS OF PERPETRATING TERRORIST ACTIONS." THE ARMED FORCES ACTUALLY WANT "TO COVER UP THEIR REPRESSIVE POLICY BECAUSE THEY HAVE SHIFTED FROM SELECTIVE ARRESTS TO MASS ARRESTS -- AND FROM GENOCIDE TO INDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS," HE ADDED. THE GUERRILLA COMMANDER ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THE GUERRILLA FORCES WILL MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF MILITARY ACTIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AS LONG AS THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF CONTINUING A REAL DIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION PROCESS WHICH LEADS THE COUNTRY TO AN EVERLASTING PEACE.
DEV-MUC3-0643	MOSCOW , 5 OCT 89 -- THE US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HAS APPROVED BY A MAJORITY VOTE AN ANTI-NICARAGUAN RESOLUTION WHICH GRANTS $4 MILLION WORTH OF SO-CALLED HUMANITARIAN AID FOR THE CONTRAS. ANALYST MARINA PETROVSKAYA DISCUSSES THE SUBJECT. THIS RESOLUTION IN ESSENCE ALLOWS THE CONTINUATION OF THE DIRTY WAR AGAINST NICARAGUA. THE SOMOSA FORCES HAVE LATELY INCREASED THEIR TERRORIST ACTIONS IN SEVERAL PARTS OF NICARAGUA BY KILLING CIVILIANS AND SANDINIST SOLDIERS. AS WITNESSED BY THE , THIS HAS NOT HAPPENED BY CHANCE. MANY CONTRAS TURNED THEMSELVES INTO THE NICARAGUAN AUTHORITIES WHEN AND AMNESTY WAS DECLARED. THEY ADMITTED THAT THEY RECEIVED ORDERS FROM THEIR LEADERS IN HONDURAS TO CROSS THE BORDER AND, BY MEANS OF TERROR AND THREAT, FORCED CIVILIANS TO VOTE FOR THE OPPOSITION CANDIDATES. SUPRISINGLY, THE SOMOSA FORCES HAVE NOT AIMED AT MORE AMBITIOUS GOALS. INSTEAD OF BEING CONDEMNED BY WASHINGTON THEY ARE RECEIVING COMPLEMENTARY AID FROM IT. CURIOUSLY, THIS NEW FOR THE CONTRAS COINCIDES WITH THE GRANTING OF $9 MILLION TO FINANCE THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN OF THE NICARAGUAN OPPOSITION, JUST WHEN MRS VIOLETA DE CHAMORRO HAS RECEIVED $3 MILLION FOR HERSELF. SUCH US GOVERNMENT AID FOR THE NICARAGUAN RIGHTIST SECTORS ALARMS THE NICARAGUAN AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITIES. ELECTIONS WILL BE HELD IN NICARAGUA IN A FEW MONTHS FOLLOWING THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS WHICH IS BEING CONDUCTED IN KEEPING WITH THE COMMITMENTS ASSUMED BY THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT, ACCORDING TO INTELLIGENCE REPORTS FROM GUATEMALA AND HONDURAS. THIS DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS CANNOT BE NORMAL SINCE CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN CONTRAS AND ARE INCREASING, AND THESE ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE UNITED STATES. AS IS KNOWN, THE SANDINIST AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN FORCED TO SUSPEND THE CESSATION OF MILITARY OPERATION AGAINST THE SOMOSA FORCES, WHICH HAD BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE MAY 1988. MEANWHILE, WASHINGTON HAS ACCUSED THE SANDINISTS OF VIOLATING DEMOCRACY AND OF HINDERING A POLITICAL SOLUTION. SUCH AN EVALUATION OF THE SANDINIST ACTION IS UNJUST IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE PEACE AND SECURITY IN THE REGION, INCLUDING NICARAGUA, IT IS NECESSARY THAT ALL THE PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE CONFLICT MAKE AN EFFORT, NOT JUST ONE. LOOK AT THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR THESE DAYS. IT LOOKED LIKE THE CONDITIONS FOR A CEASE-FIRE HAD IMPROVED AND THIS IS WHY WE APPLAUDED THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT . BUT THE PROGRESS MADE WAS REJECTED BY THE RIGHTIST GROUPS WHICH REFUSED TO HOLD CONSTRUCTIVE NEGOTIATIONS. THIS IS WHY THE FMLN REFUSES TO HOLD THE THIRD ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS CHANGE THEIR OLD METHODS OF SOLVING INTERNAL PROBLEMS WITHOUT GUARANTEEING THE SECURITY OF THE LEFTIST FORCES. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE EVENTS TAKING PLACE IN NICARAGUA AND EL SALVADOR ARE SIMILAR BECAUSE THE PEACE EFFORTS IN THE TWO COUNTRIES ARE BEING OBSTRUCTED BY MILITARY FORCES FINANCED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, WHICH CONTINUES TO KEEP A HEATED ENVIRONMENT IN THOSE COUNTRIES AND TO LOOK FOR SOLUTIONS FROM A POSITION OF FORCE.
DEV-MUC3-0644	BOGOTA, 7 NOV 89 -- SIX PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND FIVE WOUNDED TODAY IN A BOMB ATTACK THAT DESTROYED A PEASANT HOME IN THE TOWN OF QUINCHIA, ABOUT 300 KM WEST OF BOGOTA, IN THE COFFEE-GROWING DEPARTMENT OF RISARALDA, QUINCHIA MAYOR SAUL BOTERO HAS REPORTED. A SPOKESMAN FOR THE 8TH ARMY BRIGADE SAID THAT THE ATTACK WAS APPARENTLY THE WORK OF GUERRILLAS OF THE MAOIST POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY, WHO SUPPOSEDLY PLANTED THE BOMB IN THE HOME OF ANTONIO ZULUAGA, LOCATED AT VEREDA LA UNION, A FEW KILOMETERS FROM QUINCHIA. BOTERO SAID THAT THE MOTIVE FOR THE BOMBING IS UNKNOWN.
DEV-MUC3-0645	TEGUCIGALPA, 7 NOV 89 -- POLICE SOURCES REPORTED TODAY THAT JORGE CASTILLO GARCIA, NICARAGUAN CONSUL IN COSTA RICA, WHO CAME HERE TO PROMOTE THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE CONTRAS, WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED. HE WAS SHOT ON THE EVENING OF 5 NOVEMBER AT A TEGUCIGALPA RESTAURANT. ARNALDO AMADOR, SECURITY GUARD AT THE DOMOS RESTAURANT TOLD POLICE THAT CASTILLO, VISIBLY DRUNK, TRIED TO TAKE A MOTORCYCLE FROM IN FRONT OF THE RESTAURANT. AMADOR ORDERED CASTILLO TO SURRENDER, BELIEVING HE WAS A THIEF. ACCORDING TO AMADOR THE NICARAGUAN CONSUL ATTACKED HIM, HITTING HIM ON THE HEAD. AMADOR SAYS HE THEN SHOT CASTILLO WITH HIS SUBMACHINEGUN, WOUNDING HIM IN THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CHEST, VERY NEAR THE HEART. CASTILLO GARCIA WAS RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE HE IS NOW "RECOVERING", WHILE AMADOR HAS BEEN ARRESTED BY THE POLICE. A FEW MINUTES AFTER THE INCIDENT, WHICH OCCURRED AT 2200 ON 5 NOVEMBER, DONAL OLIVA, SECRETARY OF THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY HERE, CAME TO THE RESTAURANT TO GET DETAILS OF THE INCIDENT. OLIVA SAID THAT CASTILLO GARCIA HAD LEFT THE EMBASSY ABOUT 2 HOURS BEFORE. HE SAID THAT CASTILLO HAD ARRIVED IN HONDURAS LAST WEEK TO PROMOTE THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE CONTRAS, ESTABLISHED ALONG THE NICARAGUAN BORDER.
DEV-MUC3-0646	MOSCOW , NO DATE -- THE COUNTRY IS EXPERIENCING ONE OF THE WORST ANTICOMMUNIST AND TERRORIST CAMPAIGNS IN A LONG TIME. THIS CAMPAIGN IS SIMILAR TO THE ONE UNLEASHED BETWEEN 1964 AND 1970. THE SITUATION IS FURTHER AGGRAVATED BECAUSE IT IS TAKING PLACE UNDER A DICTATORSHIP THAT WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES. DURING HIS SPEECH IN COIHAIQUE, PINOCHET THREATENED TO END THE STATE OF LAW. THIS HAS BEEN FOLLOWED BY OTHER THREATS BY [DEPUTY OPPONENTS, AND BY EQUALLY THREATENING STATEMENTS AND SYSTEMATIC AGGRESSION AGAINST ARMY MEMBERS WHO CRITICIZE THE DICTATORIAL REGIME. MEANWHILE EL MERCURIO AND THE PROGOVERNMENT NEWS MEDIA HAVE ORCHESTRATED A CAMPAIGN THAT IS FINANCED BY BUCHI'S ELECTORAL MANAGERS. THIS CAMPAIGN USES EDITORIALS, ATTRIBUTED ARTICLES, AND PAID ADS THAT ARE AIMED AT MISINFORMING AND MANIPULATING PUBLIC OPINION. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO CREATE A MOOD OF AGGRESSION TOWARD THE LEFT AND TOWARD THE COMMUNIST PARTY, A MOOD THAT WOULD JUSTIFY ANY KIND OF PROVOCATION. THE WORST EXAMPLE WAS A RECENT PAID AD PUBLISHED BY BUCHI'S ELECTORAL MANAGERS ON AN ALLEGED THREAT OF COMMUNIST STRIKE SQUADS THAT WERE GOING TO GUN DOWN THE PROGOVERNMENT CANDIDATE. IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THIS STATEMENT, REPORTEDLY MADE BY A YOUNG CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADER TO LA SEGUNDA ON 31 OCTOBER, WAS LATER FLATLY DENIED BY THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC LEADER HIMSELF. DESPITE THIS DENIAL, BUCHI'S CAMPAIGN MANAGERS ARE STILL HARPING ON THE SUBJECT, TRYING TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE OF VIOLENCE AND UNEASE. THE BRUTAL MURDER OF JECAR NEGHME, UNSOLVED LIKE SO MANY OTHERS, HAS BEEN FOLLOWED BY OTHER SERIOUS EVENTS INCLUDING THE KIDNAPPING OF THE DRIVER OF VOLODIA TEITELBOIM, THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY. THIS WAS A THREAT TO COMRADE VOLODIA TEITELBOIM'S SAFETY AND PHYSICAL INTEGRITY. THERE HAS ALSO BEEN HARASSMENT OF LEADERS AND CANDIDATES OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY AND OTHER DEMOCRATIC PARTIES, AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ARBITRARY ARRESTS OF OPPONENTS IN GENERAL, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW JOINT COMMAND HEADED BY THE DEFENSE MINISTER. THE ALLEGED OBJECTIVE OF THIS COMMAND IS TO FIGHT CRIME, BUT THE PEOPLE HAVE RIGHTLY GUESSED THAT IT IS A COVER FOR POLITICAL REPRESSION SIMILAR TO THAT CONDUCTED BY A PRIOR ORGANIZATION THAT BORE THE SAME NAME. IN THIS ANTICOMMUNIST AND ANTIDEMOCRATIC ATMOSPHERE, MEETINGS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH OFFICERS AND RELATIVES OF MILITARY MEN. DURING THESE MEETINGS THE AUDIENCE IS MISINFORMED, THREATENED, AND URGED TO OPPOSE DEMOCRATIC CHANGES. THEY ARE ALSO URGED TO HOARD STAPLES AND TO TAKE SPECIAL MEASURES TO PROVIDE FOR EXTREME CONTINGENCIES. THERE IS YET ANOTHER ESPECIALLY SERIOUS DEVELOPMENT ABOUT WHICH WE WANT TO INFORM THE PEOPLE. WE HAVE RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS SOURCES TO THE EFFECT THAT THE CROWNING POINT OF THIS ANTICOMMUNIST CAMPAIGN WILL BE AN ATTACK ON A HIGH-RANKING ARMY OFFICER WHO HAS BEEN CRITICIZED FOR HIS INVOLVEMENT IN HUMAN-RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. THE CHARGES AGAINST THIS OFFICER MADE BY COMMUNIST PARTY CANDIDATES FOR SENATORS, AND THE DEMONSTRATIONS HELD AGAINST HIM BY THE RELATIVES OF THE VICTIMS, WILL BE USED TO BLAME THE COMMUNISTS FOR THIS ATTACK. WE WANT TO REITERATE OUR ABSOLUTE REJECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND OUR DEMAND FOR TRUTH AND JUSTICE. HOWEVER, WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE ARE STRUGGLING TO HAVE EVERY CRIME AND EVERY VIOLATION INVESTIGATED AND THE CULPRITS TRIED. THE ATMOSPHERE OF FEAR AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE IS AIMED AT TWISTING THE POPULAR WILL OF THE CHILEAN PEOPLE AND DESTABILIZING IN ADVANCE THE NEXT DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION. WE CALL UPON THE CITIZENRY TO BE PREPARED TO DISPLAY UNITY AND DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATION SO AS TO GUARANTEE THE NORMAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE ONGOING ELECTORAL PROCESS AND TO BE ON GUARD AGAINST ANY PROVOCATION AIMED AT CREATING A CLIMATE FAVORABLE TO AN INTERRUPTION OF THE PROCESS. WE MUST DEPLOY OUR FORCES IF WE ARE TO ENSURE THE VICTORY OF FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY IN A LANDSLIDE VICTORY FOR PATRICIO AYLWIN ON 14 DECEMBER AND THE ELECTION OF A CONGRESS CAPABLE OF GUARANTEEING PROGRESS TOWARD THE GOVERNMENT SYSTEM THAT MOST CHILEANS WANT. SIGNED: CHILEAN COMMUNIST PARTY DATED: SANTIAGO, 2 NOVEMBER 1989
DEV-MUC3-0647	CLANDESTINE, 7 NOV 89 -- FROM THIS STANDPOINT, THE PROPOSAL BROUGHT BY THE CHRISTIANI GOVERNMENT DELEGATION TO SAN JOSE SOUGHT TO GAIN TIME WHILE KEEPING THE IMAGE THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS ENGAGED IN A DIALOGUE. HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT WAS NOT REALLY SEEKING THE PATH TOWARD A NEGOTIATION. ON THE CONTRARY, IT SOUGHT TO CONDUCT UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE DIALOGUE ACTIONS THAT WILL GIVE IT AN ADVANTAGE OVER THE FMLN, INCLUDING TERRORIST ATTACKS LIKE THIS ONE. THE OPERATION AGAINST THE FENASTRAS LEADERSHIP IS PART OF THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT POLICY, AND SO IS THE WAVE OF REPRESSION AGAINST THE MASS MOVEMENT FROM THE ONSET OF THIS GOVERNMENT. THE PROPOSAL SUBMITTED IN COSTA RICA INCLUDED MASS GROUPS AS PART OF THE ENEMY. ALL THESE THINGS ARE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT POLICY. WE CANNOT ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO HIDE THIS POLICY BEHIND THE DIALOGUE, AS THIS POLICY ALLOWS ACTIONS LIKE THE ONE AT FENASTRAS TO GO UNPUNISHED AND DO NOT LEAD TO A TRUE SOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT. THAT IS WHY THE FMLN SUSPENDED ITS PARTICIPATION IN CARACAS, BUT HAS NOT SUSPENDED ITS PARTICIPATION IN THE DIALOGUE. IN FACT, THE FMLN HAS UNDERTAKEN BIDS TO CONDUCT A MEDIATION SO THAT THE ADEQUATE CONDITIONS FOR A DIALOGUE ARE CREATED AND ACTIONS LIKE THE ONE IN FENASTRAS DO NOT CONTINUE. DEEP DOWN, WE FEEL THAT IN ORDER FOR THE DIALOGUE TO TURN INTO A NEGOTIATION THAT WILL END THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT... THE PROGRESS OF THE MASS MOVEMENT IN EL SALVADOR WITH ALL THE EXISTING FORMS OF STRUGGLE IS WHAT WILL COMPEL THE OTHER SIDE TO REALLY SIT DOWN AT THE NEGOTIATIONS TABLE. SO LONG AS THE OTHER SIDE FEELS THAT IT CAN DEFEAT THE PEOPLE, IT WILL NOT BE TRULY COMMITTED TO NEGOTIATING AN END TO THE CONFLICT. WHEN IT SEES THAT THE PEOPLE WILL DEFEAT IT, AND THAT IT IS FORCED TO NEGOTIATE, THEN A NEGOTIATION WILL TRULY TAKE PLACE IN THE COUNTRY. COMMANDER MARIO LOPEZ, THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS, EVEN FOLLOWING THE FENASTRAS ATTACK, INDICATE THAT GOVERNMENT POLICY DOES NOT SEEM TO CHANGE REGARDING THE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND THREATS TO THE MASS MOVEMENT. IN FACT, THE LUTHERAN CHURCH, OR RATHER ITS PASTOR LEARDO GOMEZ, HAS RECEIVED DEATH THREATS. DO YOU THINK AN INTERNAL PURGE IN THE ARMED FORCES IS POSSIBLE? DO YOU THINK THAT WITH THAT INTERNAL PURGE IT CAN BE POSSIBLE TO STOP THE EXTREME HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN THE COUNTRY? THE FMLN HAS PROPOSED AN INTERNAL PURGE IN THE ARMED FORCES AS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE PROCESS OF DIALOGUE OR NEGOTIATIONS, MEANING THAT THE ARMED FORCES THEMSELVES MUST GET RID OF THE CORRUPT AND CRIMINAL ELEMENTS. HOWEVER, THE CRUX OF THE MATTER IS THE NEED TO PURGE THE ARMED FORCES. THE FMLN HAS TOLD THEM: PURGE YOURSELVES. HOWEVER, THAT IS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. ON ONE SIDE, THE NEED TO HAVE A TRUE PURGE IN THE ARMED FORCES BECOMES APPARENT, BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE CANNOT MAKE PROGRESS AND HAVE TRUE DEMOCRACY IN OUR COUNTRY. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS ARE PROVING THE FMLN IS RIGHT. ON THE OTHER SIDE, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE CRIMINAL ELEMENTS CONTROL THE MILITARY POWER AND HAVE INFLUENCE OVER THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL POWER. THE PRESENCE OF LA TANDONA IN FRONT OF THE TELEVISION CAMERAS, FOLLOWING THE DIALOGUE SESSION IN COSTA RICA, WAS MEANT TO TELL THE PEOPLE: WE RULE AND CAN DO AS WE PLEASE. THEN THE ATTACKS CAME. I FEEL THAT THE NEED TO END THAT SITUATION IS EVIDENT TO ALL, AS WELL AS HOW RIGHT THE FMLN STAND IS. I NOW WANT TO REITERATE THAT WE CANNOT ACHIEVE THAT GOAL UNLESS WE FORCE THE ARMED FORCES AND THE GOVERNMENT TO CARRY OUT THAT PURGE. BY FORCING THEM, I MEAN THAT THE PEOPLE'S FORCE MUST TELL THEM TO DO THAT IF THEY WANT TO SURVIVE. THE DEMAND THAT COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE LEAVE, AS HE IS ONE OF THE CHIEF CULPRITS OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED POLICY, WILL GROW STRONGER. THE PEOPLE MUST PRESS AND ARE PRESSING THIS DEMAND.
DEV-MUC3-0648	CLANDESTINE, 7 NOV 89 -- COMMANDER MARIO LOPEZ, FOLLOWING RECENT INCIDENTS AND TERRORIST ACTIONS SUCH AS THE ATTACK ON FENASTRAS , THE U.S. OFFICIAL ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS BERNARD ARONSON CAME TO OUR COUNTRY. HE SAID THAT U.S. ASSISTANCE WILL DEPEND . WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT HIS VISIT TO OUR COUNTRY? IT IS BASICALLY AIMED AT SAVING CRISTIANI'S PRESTIGE AND IMAGE, AS THIS HAS BEEN A MATTER OF GREAT CONCERN FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT FROM THE BEGINNING. THEY NEED A POTABLE IMAGE, AN IMAGE THAT PORTRAYS LEGITIMACY, AND AN IMAGE OF MODERATION THAT WILL NOT ISOLATE THE GOVERNMENT INTERNATIONALLY. THE FENASTRAS INCIDENT UNDOUBTEDLY UNMASKED CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT. THEREFORE, ARONSON'S VISIT IS AIMED AT SAVING CRISTIANI'S IMAGE AND SUPPORTING CRISTIANI'S INITIATIVE OF CREATING A COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THOSE INCIDENTS, IN ORDER TO FOSTER HOPES AND CREDIBILITY AMONG SOME GROUPS REGARDING THE GOVERNMENT'S INTEREST IN CLARIFYING THE INCIDENTS. THAT WAS ARONSON'S INTENTION. AS A MATTER OF FACT, CRISTIANI'S IMAGE IS IMPORTANT FOR THE AID ITSELF. ASPECTS RELATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE DEBATES AT THE U.S. CONGRESS, WHERE THE AID IS APPROVED. THEREFORE, THAT AID WOULD BE ENDANGERED IF THE DEBATES ON VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN EL SALVADOR ARE INTENSIFIED. IT COULD HAVE AN EFFECT ON THAT. SO WHAT THEY ARE REALLY TRYING TO SAVE IS THE AID TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING THE WAR. IN THAT REGARD, WE MUST ALSO REMEMBER THAT WITHIN THE DOCTRINE OF LOW INTENSITY WARFARE, THE POLITICAL ASPECTS OF THE COUNTERINSURGENCY PLAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE THAT WILL NOT APPEAR TO BE IN THE EXTREME RIGHT; A GOVERNMENT THAT APPEARS TO BE MORE IN THE CENTER THAN IN THE EXTREME RIGHT, IN ORDER TO CREATE EXPECTATIONS WITHIN SOME GROUPS REGARDING THE GOVERNMENT'S CREDIBILITY, AND ALSO AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. WHILE TRYING TO DEFEAT THE REBELS MILITARILY AND THROUGH REPRESSION, IT IS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN AN ACCEPTABLE IMAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT. YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE FMLN'S POLITICAL-DIPLOMATIC COMMISSION. AS A RESULT OF THE FENASTRAS INCIDENTS, OUR FRONT CANCELLED ITS ATTENDANCE AT THE CARACAS MEETING. WHAT ARE THE POSSIBILITIES FOR RESTORING THE TALKS AND CONTINUING THE DIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT? THE FMLN IS INTERESTED IN A REAL DIALOGUE, A DIALOGUE THAT WILL LEAD TO A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT; IN OTHER WORDS, A DIALOGUE THAT WILL LEAD TO NEGOTIATIONS. WE DIFFER WITH CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT ON THIS. FROM THE BEGINNING, ARENA HAS EXPRESSED ITS WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN A DIALOGUE, BUT NOT TO NEGOTIATE. THEY HAVE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT CONCEPT.
DEV-MUC3-0649	SAN SALVADOR, 7 NOV 89 -- THREE MILITANTS OF THE SALVADORAN LEFTIST SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT HAVE BEEN KILLED BY ARMY SOLDIERS IN THE CITY OF SONSONATE, APPROXIMATELY 50 KM WEST OF SAN SALVADOR, ACCORDING TO MEMBERS OF THAT POLITICAL ORGANIZATION. AMONG THE VICTIMS ARE CECILIO RIVERA, WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR MPSC ORGANIZATIONAL ACTIVITIES IN EASTERN SONSONATE DEPARTMENT. RIVERA WAS SHOT TO DEATH ALONG WITH TWO OTHER PARTY MILITANTS WHOSE IDENTITIES WERE NOT REVEALED. JUAN JOSE MARTEL, A TOP MPSC LEADER, TOLD AFP THAT AFTER LEAVING THE ORGANIZATION'S OFFICE ON THE NIGHT OF 6 NOVEMBER, THREE MEMBERS WERE ARRESTED BY "A GROUP OF ARMED SOLDIERS IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES BELONGING TO SONSONATE'S MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 6. "WE HAVE LEARNED OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CAPTURED BY THESE SAME INDIVIDUALS AND HAVE APPEARED IN THE GARRISON LATER ON. THEREFORE, WE HAVE NO DOUBT THAT ARMY SOLDIERS KILLED THEM," HE ADDED. MARTEL EXPLAINED THAT THE THREE BODIES WERE FOUND ON TUESDAY NEAR THE CITY'S CEMETERY WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO BE BURIED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES AS UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS. HE NOTED THAT, BY CHANCE, A NEIGHBOR IDENTIFIED RIVERA, AND THIS ALLOWED HIM TO SPREAD THE NEWS. THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRIPLE CRIME LEFT A PIECE OF PAPER ON THE BODIES WHICH READ: "BECAUSE THEY BETRAYED THE FATHERLAND." CONDEMNING THIS MURDER, MARTEL SAID THAT "THIS NEW ACTION SHOWS, ONCE MORE, THAT IN EL SALVADOR THERE IS NO DEMOCRACY AND NO RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE DEATH SQUADS CONTINUE TO OPERATE." ON 19 OCTOBER, SUSPECTED DEATH SQUAD MEMBERS STAGED A BOMB ATTACK ON THE HOME OF MPSC SECRETARY GENERAL RUBEN ZAMORA, WOUNDING TWO PEOPLE AND CAUSING CONSIDERABLE PROPERTY DAMAGE.
DEV-MUC3-0650	LIMA, 7 NOV 89 -- SUBUNITS OF THE PERUVIAN GROUND FORCES AND POLICE, SUPPORTED BY ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS, HAVE CONDUCTED A MAJOR OPERATION TO ARREST GROUPS OF ARMED EXTREMISTS ON THE STUDENT CAMPUS OF THE SAN MARCOS STATE UNIVERSITY. THE OPERATION TOOK PLACE AFTER SEVERAL TERRORISTS BROKE INTO THE BUILDING OF THE NATIONAL INDUSTRIALISTS SOCIETY, WHERE THEY SET OFF THREE BOMBS CAUSING EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE BUILDING. AFTER THE ATTACK THE EXTREMISTS FLED TO THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS. AS A RESULT OF THE OPERATION AROUND 100 STUDENTS WERE ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF TERRORIST ACTIVITY. WEAPONS, AMMUNITION, AND SUBVERSIVE LITERATURE WERE CONFISCATED FROM SOME OF THEM. POLITICAL TERRORISM HAS BECOME PART OF EVERYDAY LIFE IN PERU. RECENTLY A SERIES OF ARMED ATTACKS HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY BY THE EXTREMIST GROUPING SENDERO LUMINOSO, WHICH IS TRYING TO DISRUPT THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS PLANNED FOR 12 NOVEMBER. IN TIRAPATA VILLAGE A SENDERO LUMINOSO DETACHMENT SEIZED THE LOCAL MAYOR AND SHOT HIM IN THE CENTRAL SQUARE IN FRONT OF LOCAL RESIDENTS WHO HAD BEEN MADE TO GO THERE. IN THE TOWN OF SAN CLEMENTE TERRORISTS THREW BOMBS AT THE HOMES OF MAYORAL CANDIDATES FROM VARIOUS POLITICAL PARTIES. IN THE VILLAGE OF CORIS SENDERO LUMINOSO FIGHTERS SET FIRE TO THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE AND THE MUNICIPAL COUNCIL AND ALSO TOOK AWAY THE INHABITANTS' VOTING CARDS -- THE MAIN IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENT IN AN ELECTION. THEY THREATENED TO DEAL WITH ANYONE WHO TAKES PART IN THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS. AS A RESULT OF THE EXTREMISTS' THREATS AROUND 90 MAYORAL CANDIDATES HAVE WITHDRAWN THEIR NOMINATIONS, AS HAVE HUNDREDS OF CONTENDERS FOR MUNICIPAL COUNCIL SEATS.
DEV-MUC3-0651	SANTIAGO, 3 NOV 89 -- THE LAUTARO POPULAR REBEL FORCES AND THE LAUTARO YOUTH MOVEMENT HELD THEIR CLANDESTINE PLENARY SESSION IN SANTIAGO 5 MONTHS AGO. ONE OF THE DECISIONS ADOPTED DURING THE SESSION WAS TO RECRUIT MINORS, SHANTYTOWN YOUTHS, AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS "TO FIGHT A GUERRILLA WAR IN CHILE, BECAUSE THEY HAVE PLENTY OF MOTIVATION." THIS POLICY IS OUTLINED IN DOCUMENTS AND REPORTS THAT THOSE TERRORIST GROUPS HAVE CIRCULATED IN SHANTYTOWNS AND AMONG THEIR MEMBERS. SOME OF THOSE DOCUMENTS AND REPORTS HAVE BEEN SEIZED FROM BOYS WHO WERE ARRESTED ON CHARGES OF BEING DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN LOOTING OF COMMERCIAL PREMISES AND IN THE BLOODY MURDERS OF CARABINEROS PERSONNEL. SOME OF THOSE DOCUMENTS SAY THAT "SOCIALIST COUNTRIES ARE OUR STRATEGIC ALLIES," AND THAT THE MOVEMENTS IDENTIFY THEMSELVES WITH "THE REVOLUTIONARY FORM OF STRUGGLE AND WITH THE STRUGGLE IN THE TRENCHES THAT CUBA, NICARAGUA, AND EL SALVADOR HAVE USED" TO REMAIN IN THE FOREFRONT OF LATIN AMERICAN SOCIALISM. THE TWO TERRORIST MOVEMENTS MAINTAIN THAT "SEIZURE" OF LAND, LOOTINGS, OCCUPATION OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, AND "THE RECOVERY OF FIREARMS" ARE THE MAIN TACTICS TO BE UNDERTAKEN BY THE MASSES IN ORDER TO "GAIN ELBOW ROOM." IN THE DOCUMENTS, THE MOVEMENTS ADVOCATE THE DISSEMINATION OF VIOLENCE WITHIN THE MASSES, THE ADOPTION OF DEFENSIVE MEASURES IN ORDER TO BEGIN AN OFFENSIVE, AND "A WAR BY EVERYONE" AS AN INEVITABLE STEP FOR TAKING OVER THE COUNTRY. THE MOVEMENTS MAINTAIN THAT "THE FACT THAT THE REBEL ELEMENTS HAVE DISCOVERED THEIR OWN GEOGRAPHICAL ZONE, THE POWER OF THE MASSES, AND THE MASSIVE POTENTIAL OF YOUTHS, IS ONE OF THE MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT." THE DOCUMENTS EMPHASIZE THE TERRORIST ACTIONS PERFORMED BY THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT AND BY THE MOVEMENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY LEFT , STRESSING THAT THE MJL AND THE FRPL ARE THE TWO OTHER CHILEAN EXTREMIST ORGANIZATIONS THAT "IMPLEMENT THE POLICY OF THE VICTORY OF THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTION." AS FOR THE SO-CALLED "WAR BY EVERYONE," THE DOCUMENTS POINTS OUT THAT "IN THE CHILEAN VERSION, THERE ARE IRREGULAR FORCES WITH TRAINING IN SUBVERSIVE TACTICS AND STRATEGY." THE MOVEMENTS MAINTAIN THAT THEIR MEMBERS OPERATE IN THE STREETS, IN EDUCATION AND LABOR CENTERS, IN HIGH SCHOOLS, AND IN SHANTYTOWNS, ADDING THAT "THE TACTICAL SEQUENCE OF ACTION AMONG THE MASSES SHOULD BEGIN AND END WITH POPULAR UPRISINGS, WHICH LEAD TO A HIGHER STAGE OF TRANSITION TOWARD "THE PEOPLE IN FLAMES" OR "THE PEOPLE IN ARMS." THE MOVEMENTS ADMIT THAT "THE ART OF REVOLUTION CONSISTS OF AWAKENING THE AMBITION FOR POWER BY TEACHING THE MASSES TO DREAM OF SOMETHING ELSE." ANOTHER PARAGRAPH OF THE LENGTHY DOCUMENTS STATES THAT: "WE DO NOT DENY THE NEED TO REACH POLITICAL ACCORDS", WHICH WE -- AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE --COMPLY WITH, BECAUSE "THE OBJECTIVE IS TO ADOPT A POSITION OF INDEPENDENCE AND OF INITIATIVE IN THE OFFENSIVE, BECAUSE THE REVOLUTIONS ARE FOUGHT IN THE STREETS AND IN THE DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY." CONCERNING THE CREATION OF THE TWO MOVEMENTS , THE DOCUMENTS STATE THAT "OUR POLITICAL-MILITARY PROPOSAL TAKES ROOT IN THE "WAR BY EVERYONE," A SYSTEM WHICH SOCIALIST COUNTRIES AND TRIUMPHANT REVOLUTIONS HAVE USED TO DEFEND THEMSELVES FROM IMPERIALISM. THE MOST INTENSE EXPRESSION OF THIS POLICY HAS BEEN REFLECTED BY THE VIETNAMESE REVOLUTION, BY THE SUSTAINED STRUGGLE IN EL SALVADOR, AND BY THE RESISTANCE TO THE SPANISH INVASION BY THE MAPUCHE PEOPLE, UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF LAUTARO. HOW TO OBTAIN WEAPONS IN A DOCUMENT DEALING WITH THE "REVOLTIONARY PROGRAM FOR CHILE," THE MOVEMENTS CLAIM THAT "OUR WEAPONS ARE OBTAINED THROUGH THE PEOPLE'S INITIATIVE, THROUGH WEAPON SEIZURES FROM THE ENEMY , AND THROUGH INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY." THE DOCUMENTS EMPHASIZE "THE OFFENSIVE WAR WHICH WE ARE NOW WAGING SEEKS TO ASPHYXIATE THE ENEMY, OVERWHELM IT, AND IMPEDE ITS INITIATIVE AND THE CONCENTRATION OF ITS FORCES. WE SHOULD ALWAYS TRY TO CAUSE AS MUCH DESTRUCTIVE DAMAGE TO THE ENEMY AS POSSIBLE." THE TERRORISTS CALL ON "YOUTHS TO WAGE THIS REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE ON A NATIONWIDE BASIS," ADDING THAT "EVEN THOUGH THE HEAVIEST BURDEN RESTS ON THE CITIES, THE COUNTRY AND RURAL AREAS ARE CONDUCIVE TO THE INSTALLATION OF STRATEGIC FACILITIES." THE REPORT ON THE FIRST NATIONAL PLENUM HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY DEDICATED TO "ALL HIGH SCHOOL AND MID-LEVEL STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN RECRUITED BY OUR GROUPS." AMONG THE SLOGANS INCLUDED IN THE DOCUMENTS, WHICH THE LAUTARO MOVEMENT MEMBERS WILL USE THIS YEAR, ARE PHRASES LIKE "WE ARE A NEW REVOLUTIONARY GENERATION," "WE ARE HAPPY, WE ARE REBEL, WE ARE ARMED, AND THIS IS HOW WE WILL CARRY OUT THE REVOLUTION," "THE FATHERLAND FOR THE PEOPLE," AND "FREE LOVE AND GUERRILLA." AFTER OUTLINING THE EIGHT TACTICAL OPERATIONS WHICH MAKE UP "THE REVOLUTIONARY COURSE FOR THE MASSES WHO WILL FACE THE POLITICAL BREAK" DURING THE REST OF THE YEAR, THE TWO MOVEMENTS STATE THAT "WE TOTAL APPROXIMATELY 500,000 ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, AND SINCE 1983 WE HAVE FOUGHT IN MORE THAN 30 TERRITORIES AND FRONTS." FINALLY, AS PART OF A SERIES OF CLEAR TERRORIST INSTRUCTIONS, THEY CLAIM THAT THEY WORK "IN COORDINATION WITH THE FPMR AND WITH THE MIR,"SO THAT "WITH THE YOUTH, THE PEOPLE, THE ARMS, AND THE IDEAS, WE MAY TAKE OVER CHILE."
DEV-MUC3-0652	NO CITY , 8 NOV 89 -- NICARAGUA SAYS THAT THE HONDURAN ARMY IS MOVING THE CONTRAS TO OLANCHO THIS WEEK SO THEY WILL ESCAPE INSPECTION BY . NO, NO, NO. THE HONDURAN ARMY HAS NO RELATIONSHIP, NO CONTACTS, WITH THE COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES. MR PRESIDENT, WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF CARLOS FLORES' SPEECH IN... WHICH HAS BEEN SEVERELY CRITICIZED BY SOME AND PRAISED BY OTHERS ? I THINK IT WAS A GOOD SPEECH. IT IS DIRECTLY IN LINE WITH WHAT I HAVE SAID; THAT IS, THAT THE IMF'S PRESCRIPTIONS CANNOT BE ACCEPTED AND APPLIED TO THIS COUNTRY, FOR INSTANCE, BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WILL NOT PUT UP WITH MEASURES LIKE THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN PROPOSED BY THE IMF AND ENDORSED BY HONDURAN PRIVATE ENTERPRISE. WHAT ABOUT FLORES' STATEMENTS SAYING THAT RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES WILL BE DIFFERENT IN HIS GOVERNMENT? I DO NOT KNOW. THE RELATIONS WITH MY GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN RELATIONS OF TOTAL UNITY. I THINK HE WAS NOT REFERRING TO THIS ADMINISTRATION. HE MUST HAVE BEEN REFERRING TO A PREVIOUS NO. I AM NOT BEING PRESSURED. WHAT I SAID THE OTHER DAY HAS BEEN MISINTERPRETED. WHEN I SAID I NEEDED OXYGEN, IT WAS NOT OXYGEN THAT NEWSMEN, OR BUSINESSMEN, OR INTELLECTUALS WERE GOING TO GIVE ME. I WAS GOING TO GIVE MYSELF THE OXYGEN BY NOT VETOING AN AMENDMENT TO THE LAW ON ELECTIONS THAT INCREASES THE POLITICAL DEBT AND PER VOTE, PITTING THE PARTIES AGAINST EACH OTHER--MY PARTY AND THAT OF OUR ADVERSARY. IN OTHER WORDS, I AM NOT ASKING FOR FAVORS FROM ANYONE OR ANY SUCH THING. I HAVE MY CHIN HELD HIGH. NOW, IF ANYBODY THROWS A BLOW AT ME I WILL RETURN IT IF I CAN. I WILL DO SO WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF NOBLENESS AND PROPRIETY, BUT I WILL RETURN IT. SO, IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF ME ASKING FOR OXYGEN. I AM QUITE AT EASE, NOT LIKE A MINI-EDITORIAL WRITER SAID THE OTHER DAY--EDITORIAL WRITERS CAN BE QUITE MEAN, YOU KNOW --WHO SAID THAT I SLEPT LIKE A LOG THE FIRST 2 YEARS. I ALWAYS SLEEP LIKE A LOG AND DO NOT . THOSE WHO THOUGHT THEY WOULD MAKE ME LEAVE HERE A PHYSICAL WRECK OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT WILL NOT SUCCEED. I THINK HE IS THE ONE WHO CANNOT SLEEP LIKE A LOG WITH THE DIRTY CONSCIENCE HE MUST HAVE BECAUSE OF THE DREADFUL THINGS THAT ARE WRITTEN IN THOSE EDITORIALS. MR PRESIDENT, IT HAS BEEN LEARNED THAT AID HAS EVEN CUT THE AID FOR SMALL PROGRAMS, BECAUSE... AND THAT HONDURAS HAS TO PAY OVER 2 MILLION ... THAT IS NOT TRUE, NOT TRUE. ALL AID PROGRAMS ARE ONGOING. A FEW DAYS AGO, THE PRESS ALSO MADE AN IMPROPER INTERPRETATION WHEN I SAID THAT MILITARY AID WAS BEING CUT. NO. WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT, IN THE CASE OF AID, IF THERE IS A DELAY IN PAYMENTS OF OVER 1 YEAR ON ANY PROGRAM, THE DISBURSEMENTS OF ALL PROGRAMS ARE STOPPED. THERE WAS A PAYMENT CORRESPONDING TO MILITARY AID, OR MILITARY COMMITMENTS, THAT HAD NOT BEEN MADE. SO, WE HAD TO MAKE IT BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE DISBURSEMENTS NOT ONLY OF THE MILITARY SECTOR BUT OF ALL WOULD BE SUSPENDED. IN OTHER WORDS, ALL THAT IS COVERED, AND, AS I SAY, ALL THAT IS PROCEEDING QUITE WELL.
DEV-MUC3-0653	PANAMA CITY , 8 NOV 89 -- THE SALVADORAN ARMY SAID TODAY THAT TWO "ATTACKERS" HAD LOST THEIR LIVES WHEN THEY CONFRONTED SOLDIERS AFTER HAVING "ROBBED AND RAPED" THE OWNER OF A BUSINESS IN A CITY OF WESTERN EL SALVADOR. OPPOSITION SOURCES, HOWEVER, REJECTED THIS ACCOUNT AND DESCRIBED THE INCIDENT AS "MURDER." JUAN JOSE MARTELL, LEADER OF THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT , REJECTED THE MILITARY VERSION AND ACCUSED THE ARMY OF "MURDERING" PARTY LEADER CECILIO RIVERA AND TWO OTHER PARTY SUPPORTERS. THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE SAID THAT RIVERA AND APOLINARIO ALFARO -- THE THIRD PERSON WAS NOT MENTIONED -- LOST THEIR LIVES WHEN THEY CONFRONTED, ALONG WITH FOUR OTHER MEN, TROOPS OF MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 6, IN SONSONATE, 65 KM WEST OF SAN SALVADOR. THE MILITARY REPORT ADDED THAT THE "CRIMINALS" HAD ROBBED A SMALL SHOP, WHOSE OWNER, MARIA TERESA LOPEZ, HAD BEEN "RAPED" BY THE ATTACKERS. MARTELL SAID THAT THE BODIES OF THE MEMBERS WERE FOUND LAST NIGHT AT THE SONSONATE CEMETERY ALONG WITH A SIGN THAT READ: "BECAUSE THEY BETRAYED THE FATHERLAND." "WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR RIVERA'S MURDER AND THE TWO OTHER SUPPORTERS ARE SOLDIERS OF MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 6," MARTELL STRESSED. THE IS PART OF THE LEFTIST DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE COALITION, WHICH TOOK PART IN THE 19 MARCH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. IN ANOTHER TURN OF EVENTS, THE ARMY HAS ACCUSED THE GUERRILLAS OF KIDNAPPING APPROXIMATELY 30 PEASANTS IN CUSCATLAN AND SANTA ANA DEPARTMENTS, LOCATED TO THE NORTH AND WEST OF SAN SALVADOR, RESPECTIVELY. MEANWHILE, THE REBELS STEPPED-UP THEIR SABOTAGE AGAINST THE ELECTRICAL POWER GRID BY DESTROYING TWO HIGH-VOLTAGE PYLONS AND SEVEN POWER POLES IN GUAZAPA, CHALATENANGO, AND ILOBASCO, LOCATEDE NORTH AND EAST OF SAN SALVADOR.
DEV-MUC3-0654	BOGOTA, 8 NOV 89 -- THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT RULED TODAY THAT THE STRIKE BY JUDICIAL BRANCH EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING JUDGES AND MAGISTRATES, IS ILLEGAL. THE STRIKE, WHICH BEGAN ON 3 NOVEMBER, IS TO DEMAND THE ADOPTION OF SECURITY MEASURES. GOVERNMENT MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS SAID TODAY THAT THE STRIKE BY THE JUDICIAL BRANCH "IS ILLEGAL BECAUSE ITS EMPLOYEES PROVIDE A PUBLIC SERVICE." "THE GOVERNMENT," HE ADDED, "HAS TRIED TO HANDLE THIS SITUATION VERY CAREFULLY, UNDERSTANDING THAT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS UPSET BECAUSE OF TERRORIST ACTIONS AGAINST ITS MEMBERS." THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS BEGAN THEIR TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THE COLOMBIAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN 1984 WITH THE ASSASSINATION OF JUSTICE MINISTER RODRIGO LARA BONILLA. DURING THE 2 MONTHS OF THE "TOTAL WAR" COLOMBIA HAS BEEN WAGING AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKERS, SOME 20 MAGISTRATES AND JUDGES HAVE BEEN KILLED BY "NARCO-TERRORISTS." THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF JUDICIAL BRANCH EMPLOYEES TODAY REITERATED THAT THE STRIKE IS INDEFINITE AND WILL CONTINUE UNTIL "THE GOVERNMENT SATISFIES OUR NEEDS." JUSTICE MINISTER ROBERTO SALAZAR MANRIQUE SAID TODAY THAT THE STRIKE IS "TOTALLY ILLEGAL." THEREFORE, HE ADDED, "IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO TAKE DISCIPLINARY MEASURES." "JUSTICE MUST WORK SO THAT VIOLENCE DOES NOT SUCCEED IN COLOMBIA," HE SAID. THE ASONAL-JUDICIAL STRIKE INVOLVES SOME 5,000 JUDGES AND 20,000 JUDICIAL OFFICIALS.
DEV-MUC3-0655	SAN SALVADOR, 7 NOV 89 -- THE MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO FEDERATION OF COMMITTEES OF MOTHERS AND RELATIVES, FECMAFAM, HAS CRITICIZED THE VISIT TO OUR COUNTRY BY BERNARD ARONSON, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTER - AMERICAN AFFAIRS. THE GROUP SAID THAT BY REITERATING U.S. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT THE CONTINUATION OF OUR COUNTRY'S MILITARY STRUGGLE IS ENCOURAGED. HOWEVER, THE GROUP NOTED THAT ARONSON'S PRESENCE ALSO SERVES TO REVEAL A DETERIORATION IN THE IMAGE OF THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF THE RECENT UPSURGE IN VIOLENCE. WHAT DOES YESTERDAY'S VISIT BY THIS U.S. CITIZEN MEAN? IT MEANS THAT U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH IS CONCERNED THAT THE IMAGE OF THE PERSON TO WHOM HE HAS PROVIDED ALL HIS AID TO CONTINUE MURDERING SALVADORANS IS IN DANGER. CRISTIANI HAS BEEN CONDEMNED ABROAD FOR HIS REPRESSIVE ACTIONS. FECMAFAM ALSO REJECTED THE CREATION OF A COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THE FENASTRAS , AS PROPOSED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI. THE GROUP FEELS INVESTIGATIONS OF CRIMES HAVE NEVER BEEN FULLY CONDUCTED AND THE GUILTY HAVE NEVER BEEN TRIED.
DEV-MUC3-0656	BOGOTA, 9 NOV 89 -- THE POLICE HAS REPORTED THAT ALLEGED MEMBERS OF THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION KIDNAPPED TODAY TWO MEXICANS IN THE ARAUCA OIL ZONE, NEAR THE COLOMBIAN-VENEZUELAN BORDER. ENGINEERS ARMANDO CAYCEDO CAMARGO AND CARLOS MORES, WHO WORK FOR THE MEXICAN CONSORTIUM ICA, WERE KIDNAPPED WHEN THEY WERE TRAVELING TOWARD THE SARABENA TOWNSHIP, IN THE NORTHEASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. OIL EXPLOITATION AND THE ASSOCIATION OF COLOMBIA WITH FOREIGN ENTERPRISES ARE ELN WAR TARGETS. ELN GUERRILLA FIGHTERS CAPTURED OVER 3 MONTHS AGO ANOTHER MEXICAN ENGINEER, WHO WAS EMPLOYED BY AN AMERICAN OIL COMPANY.
DEV-MUC3-0657	LIMA, 9 NOV 89 -- WITH JUST THREE DAYS TO GO BEFORE THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR 12 NOVEMBER, TERRORISTS HAVE STEPPED UP THEIR VIOLENCE AND SECURITY FORCES HAVE INTENSIFIED THEIR ANTISUBVERSIVE OPERATIONS IN SEVERAL PERUVIAN REGIONS. SHINING PATH MEMBERS LAST NIGHT BOMBED AN OFFICE OF THE RULING AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE PARTY IN LIMA, INJURING FOUR PEOPLE, ONE OF THEM SERIOUSLY. DURING THE ATTACK THE OFFICE WAS SET ON FIRE. AN EYEWITNESS SAID THAT SOME 150 ELECTORAL CARDS WERE BURNED. THE CARDS, WHICH ARE THE ONLY VALID DOCUMENT FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE ELECTIONS, HAD BEEN TAKEN TO THE PARTY OFFICE SO THAT THE VOTING STATION COULD BE DEFINED. POLICE SOURCES HAVE REPORTED AT LEAST SIX BOMBINGS LAST NIGHT IN THE ANDEAN CITY OF AYACUCHO, 575 KM SOUTHEAST OF THE LIMA. THE SOURCES, HOWEVER, DID NOT MENTION THE BUILDINGS THAT WERE ATTACKED. ON 7 NOVEMBER, SHINING PATH TERRORISTS BLEW UP 4 PYLONS IN THE VICINITY OF AYACUCHO, RAZING TO 17 THE NUMBER OF PYLONS THAT HAVE BEEN BLOWN UP BY THIS MAOIST ORGANIZATION IN AYACUCHO AND IN ZONES OF HUANCAVELICA DEPARTMENT IN THE PAST FEW DAYS. A SHINING PATH "ELIMINATION COMMANDO" MURDERED A NATIONAL POLICE COMMANDER ON 7 NOVEMBER IN THE RESIDENTIAL LIMA DISTRICT OF MIRAFLORES. THE POLICE HAVE REPORTED A POWER OUTAGE IN TOWNS OF THE HUAYLAS VALLEY, IN THE MOUNTAINOUS REGION OF THE NORTHERN DEPARTMENT OF ANCASH, FOLLOWING THE DESTRUCTION OF TWO PYLONS. IN ONE OF THE TOWNS -- RANRAHIRCA -- THE SOURCES SAID THAT THE SHINING PATH MEMBERS SET THE CITY HALL FACILITY ON FIRE, DESTROYING VALUABLE DOCUMENTS. IN LA OROYA, JUNIN DEPARTMENT, IN THE CENTRAL PERUVIAN MOUNTAIN RANGE, PUBLIC BUILDINGS WERE BOMBED AND A CAR-BOMB WAS DETONATED. REPORTS RECEIVED FROM AYACUCHO AND FROM OTHER RURAL AREAS SAY THAT TERRORISTS ARE STOPPING VEHICLES IN HIGHWAYS AND THAT THEY ARE STRIPPING PASSENGERS OF THEIR ELECTORAL CARDS, WHICH THEY THEN DESTROY. IN VIEW OF THIS ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE, THE GOVERNMENT ON 7 NOVEMBER DECREED A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN THE 10 PROVINCES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LIMA, PLACING THEM UNDER MILITARY CONTROL. THIS IS THE PERUVIAN DEPARTMENT WITH THE LARGEST POPULATION AND WITH THE LARGEST NUMBER OF VOTERS. IT HAS MORE THAN 6,000,000 PEOPLE, AND INCLUDES THE PORT OF CALLAO. ON 6 NOVEMBER, THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES IMPOSED A CURFEW BETWEEN 1000 AND 0500 IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF JUNIN AND PASCO IN THE CENTRAL MOUNTAIN RANGE. THE SAME MEASURE HAS ALREADY BEEN ENFORCED IN AYACUCHO, APURIMAC, AND HUANCAVELICA. THE POLITICAL-MILITARY COMMAND OF THE AYACUCHO EMERGENCY ZONE LAST NIGHT ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE ENFORCING STRICT MEASURES THAT WILL BE OBSERVED BY THE PEOPLE DURING THE ELECTIONS. THE COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT AS OF 13 NOVEMBER, THOSE ELECTORAL CARD THAT DO NOT BEAR THE SEAL THAT IS STAMPED AT THE VOTING STATIONS AND WHICH PROVES THAT THE BEARER HAS CAST HIS VOTE WILL BE ARRESTED AND "PLACED AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE COURTS." IT ADDS THAT IF SOMEONE WANTS TO TRAVEL,TO MAKE ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS, TO OBTAIN DOCUMENTS, OR TO PERFORM COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS, THEY WILL HAVE TO SHOW THEIR ELECTORAL CARD WITH THE CORRESPONDING SEAL, UNDER PENALTY OF BEING FORBIDDEN TO PROCEED. DURING A PRESS CONFERENCE YESTERDAY, THE TECHNICAL POLICE PRESENTED 27 ALLEGED SHINING PATH MEMBERS WHO WERE CAPTURED IN SOUTHERN LIMA PROVINCES AND IN ICA. THEY ARE CHARGED WITH BEING INVOLVED IN AT LEAST 40 ATTACKS AND MURDERS OF AUTHORITIES, AND WITH PLANNING FUTURE ATTACKS AGAINST ELECTORAL OFFICES AND CANDIDATES IN THE UPCOMING MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS. COMBINED MILITARY AND POLICE FORCES YESTERDAY RAIDED THE SAN FERNANDO SCHOOL OF MEDICINE OF THE LIMA UNIVERSITY OF SAN MARCOS, ARRESTING 600 PERSONS AND SEIZING EXPLOSIVES AND PROPAGANDA MATERIAL. ON 6 NOVEMBER, DURING A SEARCH OF THE SAN MARCOS UNIVERSITY CAMPUS IN LIMA, THE POLICE SEIZED FIREARMS, EXPLOSIVES, AND TERRORIST PROPAGANDA MATERIAL.
DEV-MUC3-0658	BUENOS AIRES, 9 NOV 89 -- THE MOTOR TRANSPORT WORKERS UNION BEGAN AN INDEFINITE STRIKE AT MIDNIGHT, CONTRADICTING GOVERNMENT ORDERS WHICH STATED THAT THE UTA AND THE ARGENTINE FEDERATION OF AUTOMOTIVE PASSENGER CARRIERS MUST SOLVE THE SALARY PROBLEM THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS. THE SITUATION ON THE THIRD DAY OF THE STOPPAGE IS SLIGHTLY BETTER, ALTHOUGH A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE STILL WAITING ON THE STREETS TRYING TO GET ON THE FEW BUSES BEING DRIVEN BY THEIR OWNERS. A FEW MINUTES AGO, DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR TRANSPORTATION NESTOR FERNANDEZ ANNOUNCED THAT AT MIDDAY ONLY 30 PERCENT OF THE USUAL NUMBER OF BUSES IN THE FEDERAL CAPITAL WERE WORKING NORMALLY; BECAUSE OF THIS, MEASURES WILL BE ADOPTED TO ENSURE THAT AT LEAST 50 PERCENT OF THE BUSES WILL RUN TODAY. REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FEDERAL POLICE, THE BUENOS AIRES PROVINCIAL POLICE, AND THE NATIONAL GENDERMERIE ARE MEETING AT TRANSPORTATION SECRETARIAT OFFICES TO STUDY WAYS OF RESTORING NORMAL BUS SERVICE. SUBWAY CHAIRMAN JOSE BARBERO REPORTS THAT HIS SECTOR'S SERVICES HAVE ALSO IMPROVED, AND FIVE SUBWAY LINES ARE FUNCTIONING NORMALLY. ALTHOUGH THE SUBWAY PERSONNEL ARE MEMBERS OF THE UTA, THEY HAVE DECIDED TO SUSPEND THEIR STRIKE. THE RAILROAD SERVICE IS NORMAL. MORE COACHES WILL BE PUT INTO SERVICE, AND THE NUMBER OF TRAINS IN SERVICE WILL BE INCREASED, BUT TRAINS OF THE ROCA LINE CONNECTING CONSTITUCION TO LA PLATA THROUGH THE TEMPERLEY STRETCH ARE DELAYED BECAUSE OF A DERAILMENT. UTA SECRETARY GENERAL JUAN MANUEL PALACIOS HAS CONFIRMED THAT THE INDEFINITE STRIKE WILL CONTINUE AND THAT THE UTA WILL NOT ACCEPT COMPULSORY NEGOTIATIONS BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A LEGAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT. HE SAYS THAT THIS WOULD MERELY PUT OFF THE PROBLEM FOR A MONTH OR SO. PALACIOS ADDED THAT IT WOULD ONLY CREATE MORE DIFFICULTIES FOR THE WORKERS. FATAP DIRECTOR LUIS CARRAL ASSERTED THAT THE BUSINESS SECTOR WILL DOUBLE ITS EFFORTS TO PUT THE BUSES BACK INTO SERVICE. CARRAL SAID THAT IN VIEW OF COMPULSORY NEGOTIATIONS FATAP WILL URGE WORKERS TO RETURN TO THEIR JOBS UNLESS THEY WANT TO BE DISMISSED. TRANSPORTATION SECTOR BUSINESSMEN HAVE INFORMED THE TRANSPORTATION SECRETARIAT THAT A FEW DRIVERS ARE RETURNING TO WORK. BUSINESSMEN BELIEVE THAT IN A FEW MORE HOURS 40-50 PERCENT OF THE BUSES WILL BE FUNCTIONING NORMALLY. PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM COMMENTED THIS MORNING ON THE UTA ATTITUDE: THIS IS AN EMERGENCY SITUATION. WE CANNOT PAY MORE THAN WE HAVE. I BELIEVE THAT THE BUSINESSMEN HAVE OFFERED A BASIC SALARY OF AROUND 75,000 AUSTRALES PER MONTH. UNTIL YESTERDAY THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTED NEARLY $100, AND THIS IS A GOOD INCREASE. EVIDENTLY, THERE IS A POLITICAL INFILTRATION OF IDEAS THAT ARE NOT SHARED BY ALL ARGENTINE PEOPLE. I DO NOT BELIEVE THE INFILTRATION COMES FROM PERONIST OR RADICAL MOVEMENTS. THIS IS THE WORK OF THE ULTRA-LEFT. MENEM ASSERTED THAT THOSE WHO WANT TO WORK AND WHO ARE SACRIFICING THEMSELVES FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PEOPLE WILL BE REWARDED. HE URGED THEM NOT TO LEAVE THEIR POSTS. MENEM ADDED THAT YESTERDAY MANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ASKED HIM NOT TO GIVE IN. THE PRESIDENT SAID HE HAS DECIDED NOT GIVE IN, NOT BECAUSE HE IS STUBBORN, BUT BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO NEED THE PUBLIC TRANSPORT SERVICES CANNOT BE DEFRAUDED. ASKED IF THE RAILROADS THAT JOIN THE STRIKE WILL BE CLOSED DOWN, MENEM SAID: THE RAILROAD LINES THAT STRIKE WILL BE CLOSED. BUT MANY PEOPLE WILL BE LEFT WITHOUT TRANSPORTATION. WE WILL FIND A WAY OF GETTING THESE PEOPLE TO THEIR JOBS. WE CANNOT ACCEPT THIS TYPE OF ATTITUDE. OR WOULD YOU PREFER TO SEE THE COUNTRY EXPLODE? AT 1700 THIS AFTERNOON THE CABINET MEETING THAT STARTED LAST NIGHT WILL BE RECONVENED. THE CABINET MEMBERS ATTENDING THE MEETING WILL ANALYZE THE DIFFICULTIES CREATED BY THE UTA DECISION TO CONTINUE THE STRIKE. THE MEETING WILL BE HELD AT THE ROOM UNDER THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF INTERIOR MINISTER EDUARDO BAUZA. JUSTICIALIST LEADER ANTONIO CAFFIERO WILL ATTEND THE MEETING. PRES MENEM WILL NOT ATTEND. IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT 50 BUS COMPANIES HAVE BEEN URGED TO RETURN TO NORMAL WORK; OTHERWISE DECREE 429, WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE TEMPORARY CONFISCATION OF BUSES, WILL BE IMPLEMENTED. THIS DECREE, WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED BY PRESIDENT MENEM, ESTABLISHES THAT BUSES WILL BE CONFISCATED AND DRIVEN BY NATIONAL GENDARMERIE PERSONNEL. IN A JUSTICIALIST PARTY COMMUNIQUE SIGNED BY ANTONIO CAFFIERO, THE PARTY EXPRESSES ITS SUPPORT FOR THE DECISIONS MADE BY PRESIDENT MENEM. COMMANDER ADALINO BARBERI, THE NATIONAL GENDARMERIE DIRECTOR GENERAL, HAS REPORTED THAT THE TRANSPORTATION SECRETARIAT OFFICIALS ARE STILL STUDYING THE MEASURES TO BE TAKEN TO CONFISCATE THE BUSES FROM THE OWNERS WHO FAIL TO FOLLOW GOVERNMENT INSTRUCTIONS.
DEV-MUC3-0659	SAN SALVADOR, 9 NOV 89 -- THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI YESTERDAY REAFFIRMED ITS WILLINGNESS TO THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE THE ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS . IT ALSO MADE AN APPEAL SO THAT NO ACCUSATIONS LACKING SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT ARE MADE IN ORDER NOT TO GENERATE SPECULATIONS THAT POLITICIZE THIS CASE. IN AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE, THE GOVERNMENT MADE THE PRECEDING STATEMENT BECAUSE OF THE "BIASED PROPAGANDISTIC CAMPAIGN BEING DEVELOPED BY THE FMLN AND OTHER POLITICAL AND LABOR UNION ORGANIZATIONS, SEEKING TO CREATE A DISTORTED VIEW OF THE RECENT TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE COUNTRY." THE COMMUNIQUE RECALLS THAT ON THE SAME DAY OF THE TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS, THE GOVERNMENT CONDEMNED SUCH CRIMINAL ACTION. THE COMMUNIQUE ALSO EXPRESSES THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENTION TO CONDUCT A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION WITHIN A FRAMEWORK WORTHY OF CONFIDENCE. THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO CREATE A COMMISSION THAT WILL BE COMPOSED OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE UNITED NATIONS, THE OAS, CEDES , POLITICAL PARTIES, LABOR UNION ORGANIZATIONS -- INCLUDING ONE FROM FENASTRAS -- DR IGNACIO ELLACURIA, THE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, AND THE JUSTICE MINISTER. HOWEVER, FENASTRAS LEADERS HAVE CONTINUED HINDERING THE INVESTIGATION AT THE SITE OF THE INCIDENT, THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS. THE GOVERNMENT COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT THE FENASTRAS REFUSAL TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COMMISSION COULD BE INTERPRETED AS "AN INTENTIONAL PLAN BY FENASTRAS LEADERS TO PREVENT THE INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS TERRORIST ATTACK." THEREFORE, THE GOVERNMENT COMMUNIQUE REQUESTS THE ABANDONMENT OF SUCH AN ATTITUDE. THE GOVERNMENT, THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS, BELIEVES THAT THE INVESTIGATION IS LEGAL AND THAT FENASTRAS HAS THE MORAL DUTY TO HELP IN THE INVESTIGATION TO CLARIFY THIS CASE. THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT CRISTIANI REITERATED ITS APPEAL TO CITIZENS TO ABSTAIN FROM MAKING ACCUSATIONS LACKING SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE, IN ORDER TO PREVENT SPECULATION THAT HAMPERS THE NORMAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE JUDICIAL PROCESS THAT HAS ALREADY BEGUN. THE GOVERNMENT REITERATED THAT "ITS TRUE OBJECTIVE IS TO CLARIFY THIS BARBARIC ACTION AND TO PUNISH THOSE RESPONSIBLE, NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE." "WE REQUEST ALL CITIZENS TO ABSTAIN FROM ISSUING SPECULATIVE OPINIONS, AND, SHOULD THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO REPORT THAT WOULD HELP CLARIFY THIS REGRETTABLE INCIDENT, THEY SHOULD DO IT WITHIN THE JUDICIAL PROCESS," THE OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT COMMUNIQUE STATES. THE GOVERNMENT REAFFIRMED ITS DETERMINATION TO CONTINUE SEARCHING FOR PEACE THROUGH PEACEFUL MEANS AND DIALOGUE. ACCORDING TO THE MEXICO AGREEMENTS, THE FLMN IS ALSO OBLIGED TO CONTINUE WITH THE DIALOGUE PROCESS AND "CANNOT UNILATERALLY WITHDRAW BECAUSE IT WOULD BE VIOLATING NOT ONLY THOSE AGREEMENTS, BUT ALSO THE ASPIRATION OF OUR PEOPLE, WHICH IS TO ATTAIN PEACE," THE COMMUNIQUE SAYS.
DEV-MUC3-0660	SANTIAGO, 10 NOV 89 -- LUIS CORVALAN, FORMER SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE CHILEAN COMMUNIST PARTY , HAS REQUESTED A NUREMBERG-STYLE TRIAL FOR MEMBERS OF THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IF PATRICIO AYLWIN WINS THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS. CORVALAN'S STATEMENTS WERE PUBLISHED IN THE LATEST ISSUE OF COSAS MAGAZINE. HE JUSTIFIED THE EXISTENCE OF THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT AND THE COMMUNISTS' RIGHT TO HAVE MILITARY TRAINING. THE FORMER PCCH SECRETARY GENERAL SAID THAT HIS PARTY IS WORKING HARD FOR AYLWIN'S TRIUMPH ON THE 14 DECEMBER ELECTIONS. HE SAID THAT IF AYLWIN WINS THE ELECTIONS, THE PCCH IS READY TO PARALYZE THE COUNTRY IF ANY SECTOR THREATENS THE NEW ADMINISTRATION. THE PCCH LEADER POINTED OUT THE NEED TO MODIFY THE CHILEAN JUDICIAL BRANCH SUBSTANTIALLY. HE REQUESTED SPECIAL COURTS, LIKE THE ONES THAT EXISTED IN NUREMBERG, TO TRY THE MEMBERS OF THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. CORVALAN REQUESTED THE FREEDOM OF THE SO-CALLED POLITICAL PRISONERS, INCLUDING FPMR AND LAUTARO MOVEMENT TERRORISTS. HE SAID HE DOES NOT CARE WHETHER LEFTIST SYMPATHIZERS ARE INVOLVED IN ANY CRIME, INCLUDING IN THE MURDER OF CARABINEROS. THE PCCH WILL HELP PATRICIO AYLWIN FACE HIS ENEMIES DURING THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION, CORVALAN SAID.
DEV-MUC3-0661	SAN SALVADOR, 10 NOV 89 -- JUDICIAL SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT THE BODY OF AN UNIDENTIFIED MAN WAS FOUND ON 9 NOVEMBER ON A ROAD 17 KM FROM SAN SALVADOR. THE VICTIM WAS APPROXIMATELY 28 YEARS OLD, HIS FACE WAS DISFIGURED BY THREE SHOTS, AND HIS HANDS WERE TIED. JUDGE FREDY AREVALO EXAMINED THE BODY, WHICH HAD THREE LARGE-CALIBER-WEAPON WOUNDS ON THE FACE AND LACERATIONS ON THE CHEST. THE UNIDENTIFIED BODY WAS FOUND YESTERDAY BY RESIDENTS OF THE AREA, WHO SAID THAT AROUND MIDNIGHT THEY HEARD SIX SHOTS FIRED. TWO BODIES, ONE HEADLESS AND THE OTHER WITH BULLET WOUNDS, WERE FOUND ON 8 NOVEMBER IN SOYAPANGO, EAST OF SAN SALVADOR. JUDGE LARRY OVIEDO IDENTIFIED THE DEAD MEN AS SALVADOR BONILLA, 38, AND JOSE ANTONIO MARQUEZ, 42.
DEV-MUC3-0662	CLANDESTINE, 9 NOV 89 -- WHAT DOES THIS TELL US? WHAT MESSAGE DOES THIS CONVEY? IT TELLS US THAT THESE ORGANIZATIONS, THE SO-CALLED SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS -- THE COPREFA CALLS THEM FRONTS -- ARE COMPONENTS OF THE ENEMY SIDE IN THE WAR. WHEN THEY SIT DOWN TO TALK TO THE MAIN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ENEMY, THE FMLN , AND WHEN THEY NEGOTIATE ISSUES LIKE THE END TO HOSTILITIES, THE GOVERNMENT IMMEDIATELY MAKE DEMANDS AND ALL THESE POLITICAL, IDEOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, ETCETERA, ETCETERA, ACTIONS STOP. THE MESSAGE THIS CONVEYS IS THAT AS FAR AS THE GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED, ALL THOSE ORGANIZATIONS ARE PART OF THE ENEMY SIDE IN THE WAR. WHAT HAPPENED LATER WAS THE CREATION OF MANY SUCH FRONTS. THE REPRESSION HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND HAD INCREASED. HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT HAD NEVER PRESENTED AN IDEA LIKE THIS ONE. ONCE IT DID, EVERYTHING BECAME VERY CLEAR. ALL THE PAST ACTIONS ARE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT'S AND THE ARMY'S WAR ACTIONS AGAINST ALL THESE EXPRESSIONS AND DEMONSTRATIONS BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. THE FENASTRAS MASSACRE WAS PART OF THIS PLAN. THE KILLING OF 3 MEMBERS OF THE MPSC IN SONSONATE CARRIED OUT BY THE 6TH MILITARY DETACHMENT IN FRONT OF WITNESSES -- THEY LEFT MESSAGES ON THE BODIES STATING THAT THEY WERE TRAITORS TO THE HOMELAND -- WAS CARRIED OUT WITH THE CLEAR INTENTION OF SENDING ANOTHER MESSAGE. THE MESSAGE IS: NOT ONLY IN THEORY DO WE CONSIDER YOU COMPONENTS OF THE ENEMY SIDE. YOU ARE THE ENEMY AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE KILLING YOU. REGARDING THE VISIT TO EL SALVADOR OF BERNARD ARONSON, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS, COMMANDER JORGE SHAFIK HANDAL SAID: THE HEADS OF THE ARMED FORCES AND MILITARY UNITS WHO CARRIED OUT THESE CRIMES REMAIN IN OFFICE. THOSE WHO GAVE THE ORDERS REMAIN IN OFFICE. THEN HOW CAN AN INVESTIGATION BE CARRIED OUT? A CHAIN OF COMMAND MUST BE FOLLOWED IN THE MILITARY. IF A SUBORDINATE IS GOING TO BE INTERROGATED, ONE MUST FIRST ASK PERMISSION FROM HIS SUPERIOR, AND THEY ARE THE SUPERIORS. BESIDES, NO ONE KNOWS WHO THE SUBORDINATES WHO PARTICIPATED ARE. THAT INFORMATION MUST COME FROM THE ARMY. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE SAID THAT THE LEAST THEY CAN DO BEFORE THEY BEGIN INVESTIGATING THIS INCIDENT IS REMOVE COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE. THAT WOULD BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO. I WOULD EVEN ADD THAT THERE ARE A FEW OTHERS WHO SHOULD BE REMOVED. IF WE WERE LIVING IN A COUNTRY WITH A DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL SYSTEM AND WITH LABOR UNIONS, THAT WOULD BE COMMON PRACTICE. IT WOULD NOT EVEN BE NECESSARY TO BRING THIS UP AT A PUBLIC DEBATE. THE FIRST THING THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE DONE AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES -- HE IS INVOLVED IN THESE CRIMES BECAUSE HE IS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES -- IS REMOVE THEM AND NOT SAY THAT HE WAS NOT CONSULTED ON THIS MATTER. HE CLAIMS HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THIS, BUT WE HAVE OUR OWN SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND WE KNOW THAT HE KNEW. BUT IF HE WANTS US TO BELIEVE HIM WHEN HE SAYS THAT HE DID NOT KNOW, THEN THE FIRST THING HE SHOULD DO IS WHAT ANY MAN WITH ANY SELF-RESPECT WOULD DO: ASK FOR AN INVESTIGATION. HOWEVER, HE IS HINDERING THE INVESTIGATION, WHICH IS WHAT IS ALWAYS DONE WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS. WHEN THINGS LIKE THIS HAPPEN, A FEW -- THOSE WHO WANT TO SEE MATTERS CLARIFIED -- RESIGN, WHILE OTHERS ARE REMOVED.
DEV-MUC3-0663	MEXICO CITY , 10 NOV 89 -- THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT HAS ASKED COLOMBIA TO INTERVENE IN PROTECTING AND FACILITATING THE RELEASE OF THE MEXICAN CITIZEN JUAN CARLOS MIR, KIDNAPPED LAST TUESDAY BY A COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA GROUP. THE MEXICAN FOREIGN RELATIONS SECRETARIAT STATED THAT THE REQUEST WAS MADE THROUGH THE MEXICAN EMBASSY IN COLOMBIA. IT ADDED THAT IT RECEIVED CONFIRMATION YESTERDAY OF MIR'S KIDNAPPING. MIR WORKS FOR THE MEXICAN CONSORTIUM ASSOCIATED CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERS, ICA. THE SRE NOTED THAT IT GAVE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE MEXICAN DIPLOMATIC OFFICE IN COLOMBIA TO INTERCEDE IN THIS CASE. THE GUERRILLA GROUP CALLED ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE KIDNAPPING.

A HIGH-POWERED BOMB SHOOK THE AFP OFFICES IN SAN SALVADOR A FEW MINUTES AGO. IT IS JUST BEFORE DAYBREAK, 0500 ON SUNDAY MORNING. FROM THE WINDOWS, ONE CAN SEE THAT THE HELICOPTERS ARE DROPPING FLARES BEFORE FIRING TO BETTER LOCATE THEIR TARGETS. URBAN CELLS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT ATTACKED AT LEAST 10 MILITARY POSITIONS IN THE CAPITAL AT 2000 ON SATURDAY NIGHT, AND THE ATTACKS ARE APPARENTLY CONTINUING THIS MORNING.

AIR FORCE HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS ARE STILL FIRING AT ALLEGED GUERRILLA POSITIONS, PRIMARILY IN THE NORTHERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR. AN EXCHANGE OF RIFLE FIRE HAS ALSO INTENSIFIED. THE NOISE CAN BE HEARD THROUGHOUT THE CAPITAL, WHERE CITIZENS ARE EXPERIENCING THE WORST ANXIETY OF THE PAST FEW YEARS OF CIVIL WAR IN EL SALVADOR. ON A NATIONAL RADIO NETWORK, THE ARMED FORCES URGED THE PEOPLE NOT TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES BEFORE 0600 . DESPITE THE INTENSITY OF THE FIGHTING, THE ARMY HAS NOT YET REPORTED ON CASUALTIES ON EITHER SIDE. A MILITARY SPOKESMAN SAID OVER THE RADIO NETWORK THAT THE MILITARY UNITS HAVE SURROUNDED THE LAST REBEL STRONGHOLDS IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE, IN THE NORTHERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR. IN CIUDAD DELGADO, ALSO ON THE NORTHERN SIDE, "HEAVY FIGHTING IS CONTINUING, BUT OUR UNITS ARE BRINGING THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL," THE MILITARY SPOKESMAN SAID OVER THE RADIO NETWORK.

DEV-MUC3-0692	MANAGUA , 12 NOV 89 -- ....THE SALVADORAN IS DOING THE SAME THING SOMOZA DID WITH THE CITIES OF NICARAGUA, AND THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED OVER THIS, OVER A MASSACRE, A GENOCIDE GAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. WHAT IS REQUIRED IS A PEACEFUL SOLUTION OF THAT CONFLICT, NOT THE BOMBING OF SALVADORAN CITIES. WHEN THOSE AIRPLANES BOMB CITIES THEY ARE REALLY BOMBING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. HOW CAN THEY KNOW WHO THE BOMBS, ROCKETS, OR SHOTS WILL HIT? IT IS A TRULY DANGEROUS SITUATION. I URGE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY -- JUST AS IT BECOMES CONCERNED, CARRIES OUT CAMPAIGNS, AND MAKES STATEMENTS WHEN THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT ADOPTS HARSH MEASURES -- WHEN THESE EVENTS ARE TAKING PLACE IN EL SALVADOR TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE SITUATION. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST SPEAK OUT AND PREVENT THE BOMBING OF SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND CITIES. THIS MORNING, BROTHERS OF NAGOROTE, I HAVE WALKED THESE STREETS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF ENTHUSIASM, WARMTH, AND HAPPINESS. YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT THE BATTLE WE ARE WAGING IN THE ELECTORAL FIELD IS THE SAME BATTLE WE HAVE WAGED IN THE MILITARY FIELD WITH THE CONTRAS, THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BEING THAT THIS BATTLE IS IN THE ELECTORAL FIELD. THE ELECTIONS WILL BE BETWEEN NICARAGUA AND THE UNITED STATES, BETWEEN NICARAGUA'S INDEPENDENCE AND THE UNITED STATES, WHICH DOES NOT WANT NICARAGUA TO BE INDEPENDENT. WHO, THEN, WILL WE VOTE FOR ON 25 NOVEMBER? WE MUST VOTE FOR NICARAGUA, AND WE MUST INVITE ALL NICARAGUANS TO VOTE FOR NICARAGUA, EVEN IF THOSE NICARAGUANS ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE FSLN , EVEN IF THOSE NICARAGUANS WERE MEMBERS OF OTHER PARTIES, EVEN IF THOSE NICARAGUANS WERE INVOLVED WITH SOMOZISM IN THE PAST. IT IS A MATTER OF VOTING FOR NICARAGUA, AGAINST THE IMPERIALIST POLICY; IT IS A MATTER OF CHOOSING BETWEEN NICARAGUA AND THE IMPERIALIST POWER; AND NICARAGUA IS REPRESENTED BY THE FSLN. NO ONE MUST BE MISTAKEN ABOUT THIS. . THE FSLN IS THE ONLY FORCE THAT CAN GUARANTEE STABILITY FOR ALL THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SECTORS OF THIS COUNTRY: LARGE- SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SCALE PRODUCERS, MERCHANTS, INDUSTRIALISTS, EVERYONE. ONLY THE FSLN CAN GUARANTEE THIS BECAUSE THE UNO IS SIMPLY A MESS OF PEOPLE, A BADLY MADE AND WRAPPED TAMALE. THAT IS WHAT UNO IS, AND NO ONE CAN EAT IT. YOU LIKE BASEBALL, RIGHT? YOU LIKE BASEBALL. WHEN THE BATTER IS UP, THE PITCHER THROWS AND THE BATTER HITS THE BALL, BUT THE BALL VEERS LEFT, WHAT IS THAT? . IF HE BATS AGAIN AND THE BALL GOES THE OTHER WAY, WHAT IS THAT? . AND HE HITS IT THROUGH THE CENTER, WAY UP THERE .... IT IS A HOMERUN. THEREFORE, ONE SHOULD BAT NEITHER TO THE LEFT NOR TO THE RIGHT BUT THROUGH THE CENTER; 25 IN THE FIFTH . YOU MUST HIT A HOME RUN, 25 IN THE FIFTH. THAT IS WHERE THE FSLN IS, IN THE FIFTH. THAT IS WHERE THE VOTE MUST BE CAST, AND THAT IS WHERE SILVIO MAYORGA AND ALL THE PEOPLE OF NAGAROTE WILL CAST THEIR VOTES FOR THE FSLN ON 25 .

THIS SQUAD ENTERED THE SALVADORAN UNIVERSITY FROM THE AREA WHERE THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE IS LOCATED. WE MUST NOTE THAT THE UNIVERSITY IS NEAR THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS. THEY CAPTURED 13 CIVILIANS, BLINDFOLDED, TIED, AND TOOK THEM INTO THAT MILITARY HEADQUARTERS. ELENA FUENTES -- THAT REPUDIABLE MURDERER, THAT ASSASSIN GORRILLA -- COWARDLY ATTACKS THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AS HE IS UNABLE TO COMBAT THE PEOPLE'S ARMED PERSONNEL. FUENTES IS UNABLE TO STRIKE BACK SO HE ATTACKS MOTHERS AND UNION MEMBERS. THIS IS WHAT THIS TWO-BIT COLONEL IS ACCUSTOMED TO DOING. HE STRIKES OUT AT THE PEOPLE. LET HIM COME OUT AND FIGHT THE REBELS IN SAN SALVADOR. OUR PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF DEATH SQUADS, POVERTY, REPRESSION, AND FASCIST TOTALITARIANISM. WE ARE TOTALLY DECIDED AND FIRMLY DETERMINED TO OVERCOME THE FASCIST LATANDONA OFFICERS . SALVADORAN PEOPLE: AS ONE STRONG FIST, LET US ALL JOIN TOGETHER AND STRIKE THE FASCISTS. LET'S TAKE IT TO THE HILT.

WE CALL ON THE PEOPLE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THE BOMBING. TO DO THIS, THE PEOPLE ARE COUNTING ON SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE FROM OUR FIGHTERS. WE ALSO CALL ON THE COUNTRY'S CIVILIAN POPULATION TO JOIN THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY JOINED THE COMBAT OR ARE HELPING OUR FORCES. WE CALL ON THE SOLDIERS AND OFFICERS FORCED TO FIGHT AGAINST THEIR OWN PEOPLE TO SUSPEND THE BOMBING, TO REFUSE TO CARRY OUT A GENOCIDAL ACTION, AND TO DESERT AND JOIN OUR FORCES. WE URGE INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND RELIEF GROUPS TO HELP PROTECT CIVILIANS WHO ARE BEING HARASSED BY THE ARMY OR WHO ARE IN ANY OTHER EMERGENCY SITUATION. OUT WITH THE FASCISTS! FEBE ELIZABETH VELASQUEZ LIVES! FMLN GENERAL COMMAND, EL SALVADOR, 12 NOVEMBER 1989
DEV-MUC3-0700	SAN SALVADOR, 13 OCT 89 -- COLONEL FRANCISCO ELENA FUENTES, COMMANDER OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE, TODAY REFUTED THE CHARGES RAISED BY THE NONGOVERNMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION THAT HIS BRIGADE HAS DEATH SQUADS AND CLANDESTINE JAILS. THE CHARGE, WHICH WAS RAISED ON 13 OCTOBER BY THE NONGOVERNMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, LINKS THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE WITH THE DEATH SQUADS. THE COMMISSION PRESENTED THE TESTIMONY OF CESAR VIELMAN JOYA MARTINEZ, A FORMER SOLDIER IN THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE, WHO DESCRIBED IN A VIDEO REPORT FILMED IN MEXICO HOW THE CLANDESTINE STRUCTURES IN THAT MILITARY GARRISON OPERATE. ACCORDING TO JOYA, THESE CLANDESTINE STRUCTURES ARE DIRECTED BY HIGH-RANKING OFFICERS WHO KIDNAP, MURDER AND CAUSE THE DISAPPERANCE OF LABOR UNION MEMBERS. AFTER DENYING ALL CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND HIS GARRISON, COL ELENA SAID THAT JOYA INDEED SERVED IN THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE; THAT HE DESERTED WHEN HE WAS PLACED UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR OVERRIDING HIS AUTHORITY; AND THAT IT WAS PROVED LATER THAT ON 5 JULY, AT TRES CEIBAS CANTON, IN APOPA, HE MURDERED A PEASANT AND TORTURED ANOTHER ONE WHO DIED LATER AT ROSALES HOSPITAL. THIS MAN IS A MURDERER, DESERTER, AND THIEF. IMMEDIATELY AFTER WE LEARNED ABOUT THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY HE COMMITTED AT THE 1ST BRIGADE, WE PLACED HIM UNDER INVESTIGATION. HE FLED FROM THE GARRISON WHEN HE REALIZED THAT THE HIGH COMMAND HAD ORDERED THE INVESTIGATION. I WISH TO STATE THAT THERE IS NO GROUP OF DEATH SQUADS AS WAS STATED IN A CERTAIN NEWSCAST BECAUSE WE ARE PROFESSIONALS AND DO NOT HAVE THESE KINDS OF FORCES, WHICH WE MIGHT CALL OBSCURE. WE ACT ACCORDING TO LAW. THIS IS WHAT I CAN TELL YOU. I ALSO WISH TO STATE THAT I HAVE HERE IN MY HANDS A RECORD THAT WAS BUILT SINCE THE FIRST DAY THIS INDIVIDUAL COMMITTED THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY. HE WAS TAKEN TO AN OPERATION IN THE NEJAPA AREA WHERE HE CAPTURED EIGHT PEOPLE AND MURDERED ONE. HE THEN TOOK THEM TO THE 1ST BRIGADE AND ONE OF THEM WAS SEVERLY BEATEN. THE NATIONAL GUARD IS IN CHARGE OF INVESTIGATING THESE MURDERS AND THE CASE IS AT THE 1ST PEACE COURT, ACCORDING TO COL ELENA. THE DESERTER WAS RECRUITED DURING FEBRUARY 1989, COMMITTED THE MURDERS ON 5 JULY, AND DESERTED FROM THE 1ST BRIGADE IN AUGUST. BASED ON THE VIDEO REPORT, HE MAY BE LIVING IN MEXICO, FROM WHICH -- IT WAS HINTED -- THE FORMER SOLDIER'S EXTRADITION MAY BE REQUESTED. FINALLY, COL ELENA DENIED THAT ANY CLANDESTINE JAILS HAVE EVER EXISTED IN HIS MILITARY GARRISON. HE ALSO DENIED THAT A FENASTRAS WOMAN LEADER BY THE LAST NAME OF CHAN CHANG IS BEING HELD PRISONER THERE.
DEV-MUC3-0701	CLANDESTINE, 12 NOV 89 -- WE HAVE RECEIVED A LAST MINUTE REPORT FROM SAN MIGUEL. WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED THAT, PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION, DURING CLASHES WITH THE ENEMY IN LA ESMERALDA NEIGHBORHOOD IN SAN MIGUEL, OUR REBEL ARMY CONFISCATED THREE 22-MM RIFLES, TWO .38-CAL PISTOLS, ONE 22-MM PISTOL, AND ONE CZECH PISTOL. ON 6TH EAST STREET OF THE CITY, AN ENEMY OFFICER AND A SERGEANT WERE KILLED AND TWO SOLDIERS WERE CAPTURED. WE REPEAT, TWO SOLDIERS WERE CAPTURED AT 6TH EAST STREET IN SAN MIGUEL. ONE OF THE SOLDIERS SURRENDERED TO THE PEOPLE BECAUSE HE WAS WOUNDED. THERE IS A MARKED DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ENEMY AND OUR GUERRILLA ARMY. WHEN FASCIST TROOPS CAPTURE WOUNDED REBELS IN SAN SALVADOR, THEY QUESTION THEM FIRST AT THE NATIONAL GUARD AND 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS AND THEN MURDER THEM. OUR ARMY RESPECTS THE GENEVA AGREEMENTS. WE CONTINUE OUR SAN MIGUEL REPORTING. AT 1030 TODAY, WE DESTROYED A LIGHT TANK ON 6TH NORTH AVENUE THEREBY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF LIGHT TANKS THAT WE HAVE DESTROYED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. OTHER REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECEIVED BY RADIO VENCEREMOS INDICATE THAT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CASUALTIES IN ZACATECOLUCA AS OF 1618, IS 45, INCLUDING TWO SECTION CHIEFS. HEAVY FIGHTING CONTINUES IN ZACATECOLUCA NEIBORHOODS. IN SOYAPANGO, WHERE WE HAD RECEIVED A REPORT OF 50 CASUALTIES, WE HAVE NOW BEEN INFORMED THAT THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES INFLICTED ON THE ENEMY HAS INCREASED TO 70. WE HAVE INFLICTED 70 CASUALTIES ON AIR FORCE COMMANDER GENERAL JUAN RAFAEL BUSTILLO'S CRIMINAL AIR FORCE. THIS NUMBER INCLUDES AN OFFICER. WE HAVE INFLICTED 10 CASUALTIES ON THE TREASURY POLICE FORCES. WE HAVE RECEIVED REPORTS THAT 3 HELICOPTERS WERE DAMAGED IN SOYAPANGO WHERE CLASHES HAVE ENSUED AND CONTINUE AT 1619. REPORTS FROM SAN SALVADOR AND SAN MIGUEL INDICATE THAT AT THIS TIME CLASHES ARE INCREASING IN INTENSITY IN BOTH PLACES. A FEW MINUTES AGO, WE RECEIVED A REPORT FROM SAN MIGUEL THAT OUR COMRADES WERE IN GOOD SPIRITS AND FORCING THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE TROOPS TO WITHDRAW.
DEV-MUC3-0702	SAN SALVADOR, 12 NOV -- A GUERRILLA MEMBER DIED ON SATURDAY 11 NOVEMBER WHILE ATTACKING THE RESIDENCE OF LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY VICE PRESIDENT ROBERTO ANGULO, WHO ESCAPED THE ATTACK UNHARMED. ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, URBAN GUERRILLA MEMBERS ENTERED THE RIGHT-WING NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE LEADER'S RESIDENCE WHERE SEVERAL SHOTS WERE FIRED, BUT THERE ARE NO OFFICIAL REPORTS ON THE CASUALTIES. THE RESIDENCE IS LOCATED IN CAMPESTRE NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH IS LOCATED IN NORTHWESTERN SAN SALVADOR, CLOSE TO SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S RESIDENCE AND THE PRESIDENTIAL HOUSE, WHICH WERE ALSO ATTACKED LAST EVENING. ARMED FORCES CHIEF OF STAFF COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE CONFIRMED THE ATTACK ON CRISTIANI'S RESIDENCE, BUT THE PRESIDENT ESCAPED UNHARMED AND IS IN A SAFE PLACE. ANGULO'S NEIGHBORS SAID THAT THE DEPUTY WAS NOT INJURED BECAUSE HE MANAGED TO ESCAPE TO A NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE, FROM WHERE SEVERAL PEOPLE OPENED FIRE AGAINST THE REBELS. ONE OF THE ATTACKING GUERRILLAS DIED IN FRONT OF ANGULO'S RESIDENCE AND HIS BODY WAS FOUND THIS MORNING. CONGRESS PRESIDENT RICARDO ALVARENGA VALDIVIESO'S HOUSE WHICH IS LOCATED IN MIRAMONTE NEIGHBORHOOD IN WESTERN SAN SALVADOR WAS ALSO ATTACKED. THE REBELS ALSO ATTACKED THE "GENERAL ARCE" NEIGHBORHOOD, A MILITARY HOUSING COMPLEX, AS WELL AS THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS AND THE NATIONAL POLICE HEADQUARTERS IN "ZACAMIL," ONE OF THE MOST DENSELY-POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR.
DEV-MUC3-0703	SAN SALVADOR, 12 NOV 89 -- GOOD AFTERNOON, SALVADORAN PEOPLE. ON 19 MARCH, OUR GOVERNMENT WAS ELECTED BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WHO DEMANDED POLITICAL STABILITY, PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE, AS WELL AS JUDICIAL AND SOCIAL SECURITY IN OUR COUNTRY. THESE IRRATIONAL ACTIONS THAT THE FMLN HAS UNLEASHED IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, AND PARTICULARLY AS OF YESTERDAY, MAKE IT NECESSARY FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC TO TAKE ACTION, TO TAKE FIRM ACTION WITHIN THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF OUR COUNTRY. WE MUST ACCEPT THE PEOPLE'S MANDATE OF 19 MARCH, AND THE GOVERNMENT MUST NOW RESPOND WITH FIRM ACTION, WITHIN THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK. WE MUST RESPOND BECAUSE THE FMLN IS ATTACKING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION -- MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE -- IN A BRUTAL AND SAVAGE MANNER. THE ARMED FORCES OF EL SALVADOR ARE CONTROLLING THE SITUATION, AND THEY HAVE CONTROLLED THE SITUATION. HOWEVER, THESE FMLN TERRORISTS, WHO ALREADY FEEL THEY HAVE BEEN DEFEATED BY THE ARMED FORCES, ARE NOW BEGINNING TO CARRY OUT INDISCRIMINATE ACTS OF TERRORISM. THEY ARE EVEN GOING AS FAR AS ENTERING INNOCENT HOMES TO PRESSURE FAMILIES WHO ARE TRYING TO LIVE THROUGH THESE HARSH TIMES THAT ALL SALVADORANS HAVE EXPERIENCED. THAT IS WHY WE MUST ACT FIRMLY BUT WITHIN THE LAW. TO THIS EFFECT, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS MET AT 1400 IN THE PRESIDENTIAL HOUSE TO TRY TO SOLVE SOMETHING WE ARE COMPLETELY SURE IS WHAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WANT. WHEN WE SAT DOWN TO TALK WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE CABINET, WE RECALLED ARTICLE 2 OF OUR CONSTITUTION, WHICH SAYS: ALL PERSONS HAVE A RIGHT TO LIFE, PHYSICAL AND MORAL INTEGRITY, FREEDOM, SECURITY, WORK, PROPERTY, AND THE RIGHT TO BE PROTECTED AND HAVE THEIR LIVES AND POSSESSIONS DEFENDED. THAT IS WHY THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS THIS AFTERNOON MADE A DECISION, BASED ON THE LEGAL MECHANISMS GRANTED TO IT BY THE CONSTITUTION. FIRST, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, I WILL READ ARTICLE 29 OF THE CONSTITUTION, WHICH READS AS FOLLOWS: ARTICLE 29. IN CASES OF WAR, INVASION OF THE TERRITORY, REBELLION, SEDITION, CATASTROPHE, EPIDEMIC, OR OTHER GENERAL CALAMITY, OR IN CASES OF GRAVE DISRUPTION OF THE PUBLIC ORDER, THE GUARANTEES ESTALISHED IN ARTICLES 5, ARTICLE 6, SUBPARAGRAPH 1, ARTICLE 7, SUBPARAGRAPH 1, AND ARTICLE 24 CAN BE SUSPENDED, EXCEPT WHEN REFERRING TO MEETINGS OR GROUPS FOR RELIGIOUS, CULTURAL, ECONOMIC, AND SPORTS PURPOSES. THE SUSPENSION CAN AFFECT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY OR PART OF IT AND WILL BE DONE THROUGH A DECREE ISSUED BY THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, AS APPROPRIATE. THE GUARANTEES CONTAINED IN ARTICLE 12, SUBPARAGRAPH 2, AND IN ARTICLE 13, SUBPARAGRAPH 2, OF THE CONSTITUTION CAN BE SUSPENDED, WHEN THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH SO DECIDES BY A THREE-FOURTHS MAJORITY VOTE OF THE ELECTED DEPUTIES, BUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE SUSPENSION DETENCION ADMINISTRATIVA SHOULD NOT BE LONGER THAN 15 DAYS. THE SUSPENSION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES WILL NOT EXCEED 30 DAYS. ONCE THIS PERIOD EXPIRES, THE SUSPENSION CAN BE EXTENDED FOR A SIMILAR PERIOD OF TIME, THROUGH A NEW DECREE, IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED TO IT CONTINUE. IF THAT DECREE IS NOT ISSUED, THE SUSPENDED GUARANTEES WILL BE FULLY RESTORED. AS YOU WILL SEE, THIS ARTICLE STATES THAT IT IS THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, AS APPROPRIATE... FOR THAT PURPOSE WE ACT BASED ON ARTICLE 167, NO. 6, WHICH READS: IT IS UP TO THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS TO SUSPEND AND RESTORE THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES MENTIONED IN ARTICLE 29 OF THIS CONSTITUTION IF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY IS NOT IN SESSION.
DEV-MUC3-0704	SAN SALVADOR, 12 NOV 89 -- IN THE FIRST CASE, THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS WILL IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY'S DIRECTORATE BOARD OF THE REASONS FOR SUCH A MEASURE AND THE ACTIONS THAT WERE CARRIED OUT IN REGARD TO THE MEASURE. SALVADORAN PEOPLE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE JUDICIAL NORMS STATED IN OUR CONSTITUTION, TODAY THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS HAS DECIDED TO DECLARE A STATE OF SEIGE AS A MEASURE TO PROTECT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WHO ARE BEING UNJUSTLY ATTACKED BY THE IRRATIONALITY AND SAVAGERY OF THE FMLN'S TERRORISM, WHICH THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC CANNOT AND MUST NOT ALLOW. TOMORROW WE WILL SUBMIT TO THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY'S DIRECTORATE BOARD THE MINUTES OF THE MEETING IN WHICH THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS TODAY DECIDED TO SUSPEND THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS STATED IN ARTICLE 29 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC. IN THIS REGARD, WE WISH TO ISSUE AN APPEAL TO THE POLITICAL PARTIES. THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO REMAIN DOUBTFUL. NOW IS THE TIME FOR ALL THOSE WHO INTEND TO WORK WITHIN A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM TO STATE -- IN A CATEGORICAL MANNER -- THAT THEY ABIDE BY AND SUPPORT THE REPUBLIC'S INSTITUTIONS AND THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS THAT ALLOWS THEM TO WORK AND PEACEFULLY WAGE A STRUGGLE TO ATTAIN POWER. WE CAN NO LONGER ALLOW POLITICAL PARTIES TO QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THE FMLN IS OR IS NOT TRYING TO DO AWAY WITH THE RIGHTS THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE DEMANDED TIME AND AGAIN IN A DEMOCRATIC WAY. WE ALSO URGE THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS TO TELL THEIR RESPECTIVE PEOPLES AND GOVERNMENTS OF THE TRUE NATURE OF THE FMLN AND HOW IT WANTS TO SUBJUGATE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. THEY MUST ALSO LISTEN AND CONDEMN DANIEL ORTEGA FOR WHAT HE HAS BEEN SAYING THESE DAYS. HE SHOULD BE CONDEMNED BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN TRYING TO CONFUSE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BY SAYING THAT IN EL SALVADOR THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CARRYING OUT INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS. HOWEVER, EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS THAT THE FMLN HAS BEEN PLANTING BOMBS, AND SO FAR 8 CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND MORE THAN 100 HAVE BEEN WOUNDED AS A RESULT OF THAT INDISCRIMINATE TERRORISM. IT IS NECESSARY TO CONDEMN ORTEGA AND MAKE HIM RESPONSIBLE FOR SENDING THE WEAPONS USED TO KILL AND TO BLEED THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO DEATH. HE SHOULD NO LONGER BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE THESE ACTIONS WHILE TRYING TO HIDE THEM AND TO DECEIVE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. IT IS ALSO TIME TO OPENLY CONDEMN THE FMLN FOR ITS IRRATIONAL ACTIONS. EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT SINCE THE 1ST DAY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OFFERED TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE PROCESS. IT OFFERED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM THROUGH RATIONAL AND PEACEFUL MEANS, SINCE THAT IS WHAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WANTED AND THAT IS WHAT THEY DEMANDED ON 19 MARCH ELECTION DAY. WE CAN NO LONGER ALLOW THE FMLN LEADERS TO TRAVEL FREELY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD IN AN ATTEMPT TO DISINFORM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, WHICH INSTEAD OF FALLING INTO THE TRAP OF DISINFORMATION SHOULD CATEGORICALLY CONDEMN THE FMLN'S IRRATIONAL ACTIONS . WE ARE NOT ISSUING THIS CALL TO THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS ON BEHALF OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT. WE ARE MAKING THIS CALL ON BEHALF OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WHO ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAVAGERY OF INDISCRIMINATE TERRORISM. WE ISSUE THIS CALL BECAUSE WE BELIEVE AND WE ARE CONVINCED THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE DO NOT DESERVE THIS FATE. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE DO NOT DESERVE TO BE ATTACKED WITH TERRORIST BOMBS. THEY SHOULD NOT BE FACING THE THREATS THE FMLN IS TRYING TO CARRY OUT. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE SHOWN THE WORLD DURING THESE LONG 10 YEARS THAT THEY WANT PEACE, DEMOCRACY, PROGRESS, AND DO NOT WANT TO LIVE UNDER SYSTEMS THAT ARE ALREADY OBSOLETE IN HISTORY, THAT ARE NO LONGER JUSTIFIED OR ACCEPTED AT THIS TIME WHEN THE WORLD IS EVOLVING TOWARD PEACE AND DEMOCRACY. ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE, WE ARE ASKING YOU TO CONDEMN THE FMLN'S IRRATIONAL ATTITUDE. WE ALSO WANT TO TELL THE FMLN THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE SUPPORTING THEIR PEOPLE AND WILL NEVER PERMIT TERRORIST ACTIONS TO LEAD TO ANYTHING ELSE BUT THE DESTRUCTION OF THAT MOVEMENT THAT HAS TAINTED OUR HISTORY. WE WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT THE WAY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS IN EL SALVADOR IS THROUGH REASONING AND PEACEFUL MEANS AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC WILL CONTINUE TRYING TO ACHIEVE PEACE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND WITHIN THAT FRAMEWORK: THROUGH REASONING AND PEACEFUL MEANS. SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AGAIN WE URGE YOU TO REMAIN CALM. THE ARMED FORCES ARE CONTROLLING THE SITUATION. WE WILL SOON LIVE NORMAL LIVES AGAIN. HOWEVER, AT THIS TIME WE ASK ALL OF YOU TO SUPPORT THE PEACE PROCESS, TO JOIN FORCES IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE PEACE. THE FMLN SHOULD FEEL THE PEOPLE'S PRESSURE AGAINST ITS IRRATIONAL ACTIONS. WE ARE SURE THAT WITH YOU -- THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, ARMED FORCES, AND GOVERNMENT -- WE WILL ACHIEVE PEACE IN EL SALVADOR. GOD BLESS YOU ALL.

DEV-MUC3-0707	SAN SALVADOR, 12 NOV 89 -- THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES INFORM THE PEOPLE OF EL SALVADOR THAT FMLN TERRORISTS HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN LOOTING AND ACTS OF VANDALISM IN AREAS AROUND SAN SALVADOR BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FACE THE ARMY, WHICH DISMANTLED ITS PLAN TO CREATE A STATE OF REBELLION. ACCORDING TO REPORTS, GROUPS OF VANDALS HAVE SACKED SOME SHOPPING CENTERS, SPECIFICALLY IN SOYAPANGO, SAN SALVADOR DEPARTMENT, AS PART OF THEIR STRATEGY TO COVER THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE FMLN TERRORISTS. IN THIS RESPECT, THE ARMED FORCES SOLDIERS ARE COMMITTED TO RIDDING THE ZONE OF THESE CRIMINAL TERRORISTS WHO SEEK INTERNATIONAL PUBLICITY FOR THEIR CAUSE. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE MUST BE ASSURED THAT THEIR ARMED FORCES ARE RESPONDING IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER TO THE TERRORISTS' PROVOCATION, SINCE THE SOLDIERS DEFEND THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE AND SOCIETY. FOR THAT REASON, PEOPLE MUST REMAIN CALM. THE ARMED FORCES REITERATE THEIR CALL ON PEOPLE TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES SO THEY WILL NOT FALL PREY TO FMLN TERRORIST GROUPS AND TO HEED THE CURFEW ORDER, WHICH WILL GO INTO EFFECT BEGINNING TODAY FROM 0800 TONIGHT UNTIL 0600 TOMORROW.
DEV-MUC3-0708	MEXICO CITY , 12 NOV -- THE SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION TODAY ACCUSED ITS COUNTRY'S ARMY OF "UNLEASHING VIOLENCE AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION BY DROPPING ROCKETS AND BOMBS FROM SALVADORAN AIR FORCE AIRPLANES AND HELICOPTERS AND LEAVING A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF VICTIMS." IN A COMMUNIQUE DELIVERED TO MEXICAN NEWS AGENCY "NOTIMEX," FENASTRAS CALLED ON "INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND HUMANITARIAN GROUPS TO DECLARE THE PLACES ATTACKED BY THE ARMY ZONES UNDER PROTECTION TO AVOID FURTHER BLOODSHED." MEMBERS OF THE ARMY AND THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT HAVE CALLED FENASTRAS A FRONT ORGANIZATION OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, . ON 31 OCTOBER, TERRORISTS ATTACKED THE FENASTRAS BUILDING IN SAN SALVADOR KILLING SEVERAL UNION LEADERS AND DESTROYING THE BUILDING. FENASTRAS MEMBERS IN MEXICO HAVE ACCUSED DEATH SQUADS RUN BY THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES THROUGH THE NATIONAL INFORMATION DEPARTMENT OF THE ATTACK. ON THE NIGHT OF 11 NOVEMBER, THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS LAUNCHED AN OFFENSIVE AGAINST MILITARY AND GOVERNMENT OBJECTIVES.
DEV-MUC3-0709	HAVANA , 13 NOV 89 -- ACCORDING TO REPORTS, SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI DECLARED A STATE OF SIEGE IN THE COUNTRY ON SUNDAY. A CURFEW WAS INTRODUCED THROUGHOUT EL SALVADOR AND CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES OF CIVIL RIGHTS WERE ABROGATED AT 8 P.M. ON SUNDAY. THESE MEASURES ARE EXPECTED TO STOP THE LARGE-SCALE REBEL OFFENSIVE, WHICH BEGAN ON SATURDAY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. OVER THE FIRST EIGHT HOURS OF COMBAT MORE THAN 400 SOLDIERS AND OFFICERS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY WERE KILLED OR WOUNDED, AND SIX HELICOPTERS, ONE PLANE AND TENS OF MOTOR-VEHICLES WERE DESTROYED, THE VANCEREMOS RADIO STATION REPORTED. UNITS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT ARE MAINTAINING POSITIONS IN THE NORTHERN AREA OF SAN SALVADOR, USULUTAN, SACATECOLUQUE AND OTHER STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT TOWNS. RESIDENTS OF SAN SALVADOR SUPPORT THE REBELS DESPITE THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE BOMBING RESIDENTIAL AREAS.
DEV-MUC3-0710	CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- FIGHTING HAS CONTINUED IN SAN MIGUEL. FORCES FROM THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE HAVE BEEN DISLODGED FROM THE URBINA BRIDGE AND MANY CASUALTIES WERE INFLICTED ON THEM THERE. IN ADDITION, AS WE HAVE ALREADY REPORTED, A HELICOPTER WAS HIT AT THE 15 SEPTEMBER HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. IT WAS SHOT DOWN BY OUR ANTIAIRCRAFT FIRE AT THE 15 SEPTEMBER HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN SAN MIGUEL AND FELL ON THE PAN-AMERICAN HIGHWAY. LATER, ANOTHER HELICOPTER WAS DAMAGED IN SAN MIGUEL, WHERE HELICOPTER PILOTS DO NOT WANT TO LAND BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF OUR ANTIAIRCRAFT FIRE. ACCORDING TO REPORTS, NATIONAL POLICE POSITIONS IN NUEVA CONCEPCION, CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT, HAVE BEEN ATTACKED. AT 0645, FIGHTING CONTINUES. THE MESS HALL, THE AMMUNITION WAREHOUSE, AND THE TRAINING FIELD HAVE BEEN AFFECTED. THE GARRISON OF THE NATIONAL POLICE HAS SUFFERED CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE. FURTHER FIGHTING WAS REPORTED AT 0646 IN ZACATECOLUCA, LA PAZ DEPARTMENT. OUR COMRADES IN ZACATECOLUCA REPORT THAT THE FIGHTING IS HEAVY. WE URGE THE PEOPLE TO ORGANIZE TO OBTAIN WATER AND FOOD. WE URGE THE PEOPLE TO ORGANIZE AND JOIN THE RANKS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY. REPORTS ARE THAT THERE IS FIGHTING AT THIS MOMENT IN THE MONTSERRAT DISTRICT, NEAR CUSCATLAN STADIUM IN SAN SALVADOR. THE CAPITAL HAS NO POWER AND WATER IS BECOMING SCARCE. WITH REGARD TO ELECTRICAL POWER, THE SITUATION IS THE SAME THROUGHOUT THE NATION'S TERRITORY. IN A NUTSHELL, THE HIGH COMMAND HAS COMPLETELY LOST CONTROL OF THE SITUATION. THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY IN MOST OF EL SALVADOR'S TERRITORY AND THERE IS NO TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE IT IS 100 PERCENT PARALYZED. FIGHTING IS TAKING PLACE IN DEPARTMENT CAPITALS AT THIS MOMENT, WHILE THE GUERRILLAS HAVE BEEN FIGHTING IN THE CAPITAL FOR 30 CONSECUTIVE HOURS. HOWEVER, THERE IS ONE IMPORTANT FACTOR NOW. OUR COMRADES' COMMAND ECHELONS, WHO ARE COMMUNICATING WITH US FROM THE CAPITAL'S DISTRICTS, ARE TELLING US THAT YOUTHS ARE MASSIVELY JOINING THE FORTIFICATION WORK -- DIGGING DITCHES, CARRYING FOOD AND AMMUNITION, AND HANDLING LIGHT ARTILLERY PIECES AND MACHINEGUNS; IN OTHER WORDS, ALL THAT IS NECESSARY TO FIGHT INSIDE THE CITIES AND IN THE SUBURBS. THEIR INCORPORATION IN ALL CITIES IS A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR. FOR THIS REASON, WE CALL ON YOUNG PEOPLE IN ALL DEPARTMENTAL CAPITALS TO LOOK FOR OUR FORCES, TO LOOK FOR OUR COMRADES, TO ORGANIZE IN EACH DISTRICT AND HOUSING DEVELOPMENT THE BRIGADES THAT WILL BE IN CHARGE OF THE FOOD SUPPLY, TO DIG MORE DITCHES, TO BUILD ANTIAIRCRAFT SHELTERS, AND TO SUPPLY INFORMATION, WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT AT THIS MOMENT. WE MUST ORGANIZE THE INFORMATION NETWORK. WE MUST HAVE VIGILANCE IN EVERY CORNER IN EVERY DISTRICT AND NEIGHBORHOOD. WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT EARLY TODAY THE ARMED FORCES CARRIED OUT A NUMBER OF SEARCHES AND ARRESTS IN THE CAPITAL. WELL, WE CALL ON THE POPULATION TO ORGANIZE AGAINST THE SEARCHES AND ARRESTS. ESTABLISH VIGILANCE. DO NOT LET THEM TAKE AWAY ANYBODY. ARM YOURSELVES -- TAKE OUT YOUR PISTOLS, MAKE MOLOTOV COCKTAILS WITH BOTTLES AND GASOLINE -- IN OTHER WORDS, DEFEND YOURSELVES. AT 0704, IT WAS REPORTED TO US FROM SAN SALVADOR THAT FIGHTING IS TAKING PLACE IN EL CARMEN AGAINST THE NATIONAL POLICE. A NEW PLACE HAS BEEN ADDED TO THOSE IN WHICH MILITARY ACTIVITY IS TAKING PLACE. MEANWHILE, OTHER REPORTS INDICATE THAT FMLN SNIPERS ARE HARASSING THE ARMY'S MOVEMENTS IN VARIOUS PLACES IN THE CAPITAL. THE REPORT SAYS THAT OUR SNIPERS POSTED IN THE TALLEST BUILDINGS ARE EFFECTIVELY KEEPING THE ARMY PATROLS AND MOVEMENTS AT BAY. THE ARMY IS BEGINNING TO HAVE TROUBLE EVACUATING ITS WOUNDED, BECAUSE IN THE CAPITAL EPISODES ARE NOW TAKING PLACE WHICH HAD BEEN ONLY SEEN IN MORAZAN BEFORE; THAT IS, HELICOPTERS FLYING IN TO PICK UP THE WOUNDED, AS THEY DID IN THE VALLEYS AND THE PLAINS. THIS IS HAPPENING NOW IN THE CAPITAL BECAUSE THE ARMY TROOPS CANNOT ADVANCE INTO CERTAIN AREAS TO PICK UP THEIR DEAD AND WOUNDED, WHO ARE VERY, VERY NUMEROUS. THE HELICOPTERS NOW HAVE TO LAND IN SOCCER FIELDS AND IN OTHER PLACES TO EVACUATE THE WOUNDED. SUCH IS THE SITUATION IN SAN SALVADOR. AS WE HAVE ALREADY REPORTED, FIGHTING CONTINUES IN VARIOUS PLACES IN THE CAPITAL, WHERE THERE ARE FMLN-CONTROLLED AREAS.
DEV-MUC3-0711	SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 -- ACCORDING TO CIVILIAN EYEWITNESSES, SALVADORAN ARMY TROOPS BOMBED THE UNIVERSITY'S SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. THE SAME SOURCES REPORTED THAT SOLDIERS OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE CAPTURED AND BLINDFOLDED 10 UNIVERSITY GUARDS YESTERDAY AND THEN TOOK THEM OFF THE CAMPUS. ACCORDING TO THESE EYEWITNESSES, ARMY TROOPS ENTERED THE UNIVERSITY OF EL SALVADOR USING AN ARMORED VEHICLE AND A 105-MM CANNON. THEY SAID THAT THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE WAS BOMBED LATER ON. HOWEVER, OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE NEITHER CONFIRMED NOR DENIED THIS REPORT. THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES HAVE ACCUSED THE UNIVERSITY OF EL SALVADOR OF BEING A GUERRILLA "SANCTUARY" AND HAVE SAID THAT THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE WAS ATTACKED FROM THE CAMPUS. IN ADDITION, THESE EYEWITNESSES SAID THAT 10 UNIVERSITY "GUARDS" WERE CAPTURED ON CAMPUS, WHICH IS LOCATED NEAR THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE, ONE OF THE GARRISONS ATTACKED BY THE GUERRILLAS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE REBEL OFFENSIVE BEGUN ON THE NIGHT OF 11 NOVEMBER. ACCORDING TO THESE SOURCES, THE SOLDIERS SEIZED PROPAGANDA MATERIAL. THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT BEGAN AN OFFENSIVE ON 11 NOVEMBER, WHICH HAS INCLUDED AN ATTACK ON THE HOMES OF IMPORTANT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, INCLUDING THAT OF SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI. ON THE SAME NIGHT, THE REBELS ALSO ATTACKED THE NATIONAL POLICE HEADQUARTERS IN ZACAMIL, ONE OF THE MOST POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, AS WELL AS MILITARY POSITIONS IN A DOZEN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS LOCATED IN VARIOUS SECTORS OF THIS CAPITAL. THE FIGHTING THEN SPREAD TO SANTA ANA, CABANAS, LA PAZ, SAN VICENTE, SAN MIGUEL, AND USULUTAN DEPARTMENTS IN THE COUNTRY'S NORTH, CENTRAL, AND EASTERN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. THE REBEL OFFENSIVE HAS ALREADY RESULTED IN HUNDREDS OF CASUALTIES -- APPROXIMATELY 300 ACCORDING TO THE ARMY, AND 400 ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLAS. THIS COMPELLED THE GOVERNMENT TO IMPOSE A STATE OF SIEGE AND A CURFEW THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.
DEV-MUC3-0712	CLANDESTINE, 13 NOV 89 -- THIS IS A LAST MINUTE REPORT FROM THE CAPITAL. ATTENTION, OUR PEOPLE, AND ALSO OTHER FRATERNAL PEOPLES WHO ARE LISTENING TO US IN SEVERAL PARTS OF THE WORLD, ESPECIALLY IN LATIN AMERICA. ATTENTION. AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS ARE NOW BOMBING AND FIRING ROCKETS AT VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CAPITAL.

AT 0933 TODAY A HELICOPTER BOMBED HEAVILY POPULATED AREAS IN CIUDAD DELGADO. AT 0900, MORE THAN 30 MINUTES AGO, A C-47 PLANE FITTED WITH .50-CALIBER MACHINEGUNS STRAFED DOWNTOWN MEJICANOS. MEANWHILE, AN A-37 PLANE, WHICH IS A FIGHTER-BOMBER PLANE KNOWN AS DRAGONFLY, FITTED WITH ROCKET LAUNCHERS AND 7.62-MM MACHINEGUNS AND CAPABLE OF DROPPING BOMBS OF 200, 500, AND EVEN 750 POUNDS, ALONG WITH A PUSH- PULL PLANE, ALSO FITTED WITH ROCKETS, BOMBED THE AREA NEAR THE MARIONA JAIL TO THE NORTH OF THE CAPITAL. WE ARE DENOUNCING THESE CRIMINAL ACTIONS OF THE FASCIST REGIME HEADED BY ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND ROBERTO D'AUBUISSION IN THE CAPITAL. THESE BOMBINGS ARE UNPRECEDENTED IN SAN SALVADOR. IN PREVIOUS YEARS, WE HAVE DENOUNCED BOMBINGS IN RURAL AREAS. THE AERIAL DEATH SQUAD, HEADED BY THE GENOCIDAL JUAN RAFAEL BUSTILLOS SINCE THE WAR BEGAN, HAS CAUSED HUNDREDS OF DEATHS, INCLUDING MUTILATIONS AND INJURIES. NOW, BEFORE THE VERY EYES OF THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS AND DIPLOMATS ACCREDITED IN SAN SALVADOR, AND A MILLION INHABITANTS IN THE CAPITAL, THE AIR FORCE IS BOMBING POOR NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE CAPITAL. WE ARE TOLD THAT A HELICOPTER HAS BEEN BOMBING THE NORTHERN TRUNK HIGHWAY IN CIUDAD DELGADO. THESE HELICOPTERS FITTED WITH ROCKETS ARE KNOWN AS UH-1H. THEY HAVE BEEN MODIFIED AND ARE FITTED WITH 7.62-MM MACHINEGUNS AND SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES. THIS U.S.-MADE HELICOPTER HAS BEEN DROPPING ROCKETS ON THE NORTHERN TRUNK HIGHWAY IN CIUDAD DELGADO. IN SUM, A C-47 PLANE MACHINEGUNNED DOWNTOWN MEJICANOS, AND AN A- 37 PLANE AND A PUSH-AND-PULL PLANE, WHICH IS ALSO KNOWN AS 0-2 PLANE, BOMBED THE MARIONA AREA. A LAST MINUTE REPORT FROM THE CAPITAL AT 1541 GMT: OUR FORCES CONTINUE TO ADVANCE IN SAN SALVADOR. FMLN UNITS HAVE TAKEN CONTROL OF A PART OF THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD, THE TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THE OLIGARCHY WITH THE MOST WELL-KNOWN SURNAMES LIVES, A NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THE MOST LUXURIOUS MANSIONS AND THE LATEST MODEL CARS. OUR MEN HAVE TAKEN UP POSITIONS IN THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD, EXACTLY ATOP THE SAN SALVADOR ARCHBISHOPRIC. OUR MEN REPORTED THAT AT 1530 THEY TOOK CONTROL OF A PART OF THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD, IN THE WESTERN PART OF THE CAPITAL. THEY ARE ALSO MOVING IN TO TAKE UP POSITIONS AT THE PABLO ARNOLDO GUZMAN NATIONAL GEOGRAPHICAL INSTITUTE IN MEJICANOS. POSITIONS HAVE BECOME CONSOLIDATED IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE CITY, AND CLASHES CONTINUE AROUND THE NATIONAL POLICE GARRISONS IN ZACAMIL AND CUSCATANCINGO.
DEV-MUC3-0713	CLANDESTINE, 13 NOV 89 -- WE REAFFIRM OUR APPEAL TO HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS, THE OAS, AND DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS, AND WE MAKE A SPECIAL CALL TO COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS, NOBEL PEACE PRIZE LAUREATE, TO CONTACT THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND THE HIGH COMMAND OF THE FASCIST ARMED FORCES TO PRESSURE THEM TO STOP THEIR BOMBINGS. INTERNATIONAL JOURNALISTS HAVE ALREADY CONFIRMED THAT THESE BOMBINGS ARE TAKING PLACE IN DENSELY POPULATED AREAS OF THE CAPITAL. WE LEARNED THAT VIDEO REPORTS ARE ALREADY GOING AROUND THE WORLD SHOWING IMAGES OF THE ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD. THE BOMBINGS DESTROYED SOME BUILDINGS THERE AND SOME HOUSES IN OTHER AREAS OF THE CAPITAL. THERE ARE DOZENS OF CIVILIAN CASUALTIES. THERE WERE INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS THIS MORNING IN SAN MIGUEL'S ESMERALDA NEIGHORHOOD AND IN OTHER NEIGHORHOODS. AT ABOUT 0900, A PLANE DROPPED A BOMB THAT HIT A CIVILIAN HOME IN SAN MIGUEL. A 12- YEAR-OLD GIRL WAS INJURED IN SOYAPANGO. WE CALL ON DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS, THE UNITED NATIONS, AND THE OAS TO PRESSURE THE FASCIST GOVERNMENT TO STOP ITS BOMBINGS AGAINST THE PEOPLE, TO STOP THE INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS.
DEV-MUC3-0714	SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 -- ...CARRY OUT THE PERTINENT AND NECESSARY ACTIONS AND THUS CONTRIBUTE TO THE STABILIZATION OF THE SITUATION SO THAT WE MAY AGAIN ENJOY THE SAFETY AND CALM CURRENTLY BEING AFFECTED BY TERRORIST RAIDS IN SOME AREAS AROUND SAN MIGUEL. WE AS AN INSTITUTION WILL GUARANTEE THAT IN THE NEXT 8 OR 10 HOURS THE PEACE YOU NEED WILL BE REGAINED. THIS IS A PROMISE WE ARE MAKING, AND WE WILL KEEP IT SO THAT YOU WILL REALLY HAVE THAT TRANQUILITY YOU NEED. HOWEVER, I MUST ASK THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT ON THE STREET TO PLEASE REFRAIN FROM DOING THIS. IF YOU ARE OUT ON THE STREET, PLEASE DO NOT RUN IF YOU SEE SOLDIERS. WALK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET. YOU WILL NOT HAVE TROUBLE. WE DO NOT USE VIOLENCE. WE USE MILITARY CONTROL TECHNIQUES. WE DO NOT USE IRRATIONAL TERROR. WE USE STRICTLY MILITARY TECHNIQUES AND TACTICS. WE ASK THAT YOU REFRAIN FROM GOING OUT IN THE NEXT 8 HOURS, OR AT LEAST STAY OFF THE STREETS. IF YOU MUST GO OUT, DO IT, BUT WALK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET. DO NOT RUN, AND DO NOT FEAR THE AUTHORITIES. THE AUTHORITIES ARE THERE TO PROTECT YOUR SAFETY WHICH IS BEING AFFECTED. THE AUTHORITIES WISH TO GIVE YOU BACK YOUR TRANQUILITY. I WANT YOU TO REST ASSURED THAT WE WILL NOT FAIL YOU. BEFORE A MARXIST-LENINIST PLAN TAKES OVER ONE OF OUR CITIES OR TOWNS, THEY WILL HAVE TO WALK OVER THE BODIES OF EACH AND EVERY SOLDIER. THE SOLDIERS ARE WILLING TO DEFEND EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. THAT IS WHAT I WANTED TO TELL YOU. I JUST WANTED TO SEND YOU THIS MESSAGE OF FAITH, HOPE, AND TRUST IN YOUR GOVERNMENT AND YOUR INSTITUTION. THAT IS ESSENTIAL. WE MUST NOT YIELD WHEN CONFRONTED BY MARXIST OR COMMUNIST PLANS. OUR GOVERNMENT AND OUR ARMED FORCES NEED YOUR SUPPORT TODAY MORE THAN EVER. SUPPORT OUR STRUGGLE IN DEFENSE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. REST ASSURED THAT ALONG THIS PATH THERE IS NO RETURN. WE EITHER ACHIEVE OUR FINAL GOAL OF CONSOLIDATION, OR WE FALL ALONG THE PATH. WE MUST GIVE OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS A FREE AND DEMOCRATIC HOMELAND. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, I WILL BE MORE THAN GLAD TO ANSWER THEM; HOWEVER, THIS WAS THE MESSAGE I WANTED TO LEAVE WITH YOU.
DEV-MUC3-0715	CLANDESTINE, 13 NOV 89 -- IN FRONT OF US WE HAVE A MAP OF SAN SALVADOR, WHERE OUR COMRADES ARE BUILDING BARRICADES THROUGHOUT THE CITY. WE HAVE THE MAP OF SAN SALVADOR SHOWING THE NORTHERN PART OF THE CITY COVERED WITH LITTLE RED FLAGS. THESE ARE POINTS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT . THESE ARE AREAS WHERE OUR FORCES ARE ATTACKING ARMY POSITIONS AND WHERE AMBUSHES HAVE BEEN SET. THERE ARE FLAGS POINTING TO AREAS WHERE AMBUSHES HAVE BEEN SET, AREAS FROM WHICH SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN DISLODGED, AND AREAS UNDER FMLN CONTROL. IF WE LOOK AT THE NORTHERN PART OF THE CITY MAP WE CAN SEE LITTLE RED FLAGS IN THE AREA OF ZACAMIL, EL CARMEN NEIGHBORHOOD, EL CARMEN HILL AREA, UNIVERSITARIA NEIGHBORHOOD, MEJICANOS, EL PORVERNIR NEIGHBORHOOD, CIUDAD DELGADO, SAN SEBASTIAN NEIGHBORHOOD, GUADALCANAL NEIGHBORHOOD, CUSCATLAN AND LOMAS DE RIO NEIGHBORHOODS, AND ALL OF SOYAPANGO. FMLN FORCES ARE ALL OVER THE SOYAPANGO AREA. RED AND WHITE FLAGS DENOTE FIRING LINES, AND THESE ARE FOUND IN CIUDAD CREDISA AND DOWNTOWN AMATEPEQUE. THE SAME RED AND WHITE FLAGS ALSO SHOW HOW OUR REVOLUTIONARY FORCES ARE ADVANCING. WE SEE THESE RED AND WHITE FLAGS IN ANTIGUO CUSCATLAN. LIKEWISE, IN SANTA TECLA OUR FORCES ARE MOBILIZING AND STRENGTHENING THEIR POSITIONS. OUR LATEST REPORT STATES THAT IN DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR, ONLY 10 BLOCKS FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE, HUGE BARRICADES HAVE BEEN BUILT BY THE PEOPLE AND THE FMLN, THUS CONSOLIDATING OUR POSITION. THIS LATEST REPORT CONFIRMS THIS INFORMATION, AND WE ARE GOING TO STICK A LITTLE RED FLAG ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, 10 BLOCKS FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE. THE LITTLE RED FLAG CAN NOW BE SEEN IN SAN JACINTO NEIGHBORHOOD.
DEV-MUC3-0716	SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV -- THE VEHICLE OF MEXICAN TELEVISION NEWSMAN EPIGMENIO IBARRA WAS TOTALLY DESTROYED BY A POWERFUL BOMB TODAY, BUT IBARRA WAS NOT HURT. IT IS NOT YET KNOWN WHO PLACED THE BOMB IN THE VEHICLE WHILE IBARRA WAS AWAY. THE BOMB IN IBARRA'S VEHICLE EXPLODED TODAY IN AN AREA OF SAN SALVADOR WHERE HEAVY FIGHTING BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE GUERRILLAS IS CURRENTLY UNDER WAY. ON SATURDAY THE GUERRILLAS LAUNCHED THE MOST POWERFUL OFFENSIVE IN THE PAST 8 YEARS. THE BLOODY FIGHTING BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE GUERRILLAS CONTINUES TODAY FOR THE THIRD CONSECUTIVE DAY, AND THERE HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY 400 CASUALTIES INCLUDING SOLDIERS, REBELS, AND CIVILIANS. TODAY, MONDAY, SAN SALVADOR IS PRACTICALLY AT A STANDSTILL DUE TO THE FIGHTING AND THE "TRANSPORTATION STRIKE" CALLED BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, WHICH ON SATURDAY LAUNCHED ITS LARGEST MILITARY OFFENSIVE SINCE 1981. ACCORDING TO THE ARMED FORCES, 127 PERSONS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND 240 WOUNDED SINCE THE FIGHTING BEGAN. FOR THEIR PART, THE GUERRILLAS CLAIM THAT THEY HAVE INFLICTED MORE THAN 400 CASUALTIES ON THE ARMY, BUT HAVE PROVIDED NO FIGURES ON LOSSES OR ON THE DEAD AND INJURED AMONG ITS RANKS.
DEV-MUC3-0717	SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 -- A SPOKESMAN FOR THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE HAS REPORTED THAT, IN ADDITION TO 30 DEAD CIVILIANS, MORE THAN 200 SOLDIERS AND GUERRILLAS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN FIERCE CLASHES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE AT NIGHT SINCE 11 NOVEMBER IN THE CAPITAL AND SEVERAL KEY SALVADORAN CITIES. THE SOURCE ADDED THAT THERE COULD BE MORE THAN 300 WOUNDED CIVILIANS AND MILITARY MEN. COPREFA STATED THAT 127 GUERRILLAS AND ABOUT 50 ARMY TROOPS WERE REPORTED DEAD EARLY THIS MORNING, BUT THE FIGURES ARE GROWING BECAUSE STRONG FIGHTING CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE NORTHERN AREA OF THE CAPITAL AND THE COUNTRY'S EASTERN AREA. THE ROSALES HOSPITAL, THE MAIN ONE IN THE CAPITAL, WAS ASSISTING MORE THAN 100 CIVILIANS WOUNDED IN THE INTENSE CLASHES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE 11 NOVEMBER WHILE MEDICAL AUTHORITIES ARE CALLING ON DOCTORS AND NURSES TO HELP THE WOUNDED. ANOTHER 100 WOUNDED WERE TAKEN TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY HOSPITAL AND ABOUT 100 MORE WERE TAKEN TO OTHER HOSPITALS IN THE CAPITAL AND COUNTRYSIDE. MEANWHILE, THE SANTA TERESA HOSPITAL IN ZACATECOLUCA, 56 KM EAST OF THE CAPITAL, WAS OCCUPIED BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GUERRILLAS THIS MORNING. FIGHTING INTENSIFIED IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA THIS MORNING. THERE WAS FIERCE FIGHTING IN ZACATECOLUCA TODAY AND ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, 13 BODIES WERE SEEN ON THE STREETS; EIGHT GUERRILLAS, FOUR SOLDIERS, AND A CIVILIAN. THE GUERRILLAS, WHO, CARRYING AK-47 RIFLES AND PISTOLS, HAVE ASKED FOR WATER AND FOOD IN SOME HOUSES, HAVE OCCUPIED FIVE NEIGHBORHOODS IN SAN MIGUEL, THE THIRD MOST IMPORTANT CITY IN THE COUNTRY, 140 KM FROM THE CAPITAL. SAN MIGUEL AND ZACATECOLUCA HAVE NO ELECTRICITY OR WATER TODAY. ACCORDING TO GUERRILLA SOURCES, SAN VICENTE AND USULUTAN, IN THE COUNTRY'S EAST-CENTRAL AREA, WERE SITES OF FIERCE FIGHTING THIS MORNING.
DEV-MUC3-0718	CLANDESTINE, 13 NOV 89 -- THIS IS A LAST MINUTE REPORT BROUGHT TO YOU THROUGH THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY NETWORK, RADIO FARABUNDO MARTI AND RADIO VENCEREMOS IN NETWORK BROADCASTING TO THE WHOLE COUNTRY. THIS LAST MINUTE REPORT STATES THAT THE AIR FORCE HAS BOMBED AND STRAFED THE AREA ACROSS FROM THE INCA FACTORY AND PRADOS DE VENECIA IN SOYAPANGO. AS A RESULT OF THIS BOMBING AND STRAFING ACTION 3 PERSONS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND 12 INJURED. IN PRADOS DE VENECIA HOUSES HAVE BEEN TOTALLY DESTROYED. ATTENTION, WE CALL THIS INFORMATION TO THE ATTENTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS, AND INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS. THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS AS A RESULT OF THE BOMBINGS IN SAN SALVADOR IS INCREASING. ACROSS FROM THE INCA FACTORY AND PRADOS DE VENECIA IN SOYAPANGO, THE AIR FORCE IS INDISCRIMINATELY BOMBING AND STRAFING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. ATTENTION, THE REPORT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM SAN SALVADOR ADVISES US THAT 3 PERSONS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND 12 INJURED AND HOUSES DESTROYED IN PRADOS DE VENECIA AS A RESULT OF THE INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING BY THE AIR FORCE. THE GENOCIDAL AND COWARDLY ATTITUDE OF THE AIR FORCE, BOMBING AREAS JUST LIKE ANASTASIO SOMOZA DID DURING THE LAST DAYS OF HIS DICTATORSHIP, IS SHOWING THE WORLD: 1. THE FASCIST NATURE OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S REGIME. THE FASCIST NATURE OF LA TANDONA HAS REMOVED THE CIVILIAN MASK OFF THE GOVERNMENT'S FACE AND SHOWN ITS REAL MILITARY AND FASCIST FACE. 2. THESE BOMBINGS PROVE THAT AS THE HOURS GO BY THEY BECOME MORE DESPERATE AND HAVE LOST TOTAL CONTROL OF THE SITUATION. THE PROMISES MADE BY CRISTIANI AND THE DEFENSE MINISTER THAT THEY WOULD GET THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL ON SATURDAY HAS FAILED. ON SATURDAY NIGHT COLONEL PONCE PROMISED TO BRING THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL ON SATURDAY NIGHT, HOWEVER, MORE THAN 32 HOURS HAVE GONE BY AND THE ARMED FORCES AND THE HIGH COMMAND HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO STOP THE REVOLUTIONARY ADVANCE IN SAN SALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL, AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S MILITARY POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR ARE BEING CONSOLIDATED AFTER MORE THAT 32 HOURS OF UNINTERRUPTED FIGHTING. THE PLAN FOR THE DEFENSE OF SAN SALVADOR HAS FAILED. THE U.S. ADVISERS AND THE HIGH COMMAND HAVE BEEN PREPARING THIS PLAN FOR MONTHS. WE HEREBY ADVISE THE PEOPLE THAT THE PLAN FOR THE DEFENSE OF SAN SALVADOR HAS FAILED. THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO PREVENT OUR FORCES FROM ARMING AND GETTING SUPPLIES; THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO STOP OUR FMLN FORCES FROM ENTERING SAN SALVADOR, AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO STOP OUR ADVANCE OR RECOVER A SINGLE INCH OF THE CITY OCCUPIED BY THE FMLN. WE CAN STATE THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO WIN BACK A SINGLE INCH OF TERRITORY UNDER OUR CONTROL IN MEJICANOS, AYUTUXTEPEQUE, CUSCATANCINGO, ZACAMIL, UNIVERSITARIA NORTE, OR SOYAPANGA. THE ARMED FORCES HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ADVANCE A SINGLE INCH. EVERY SINGLE STEP IN AN ATTEMPT TO WIN BACK THE NEIGHBORHOODS WE OCCUPY HAS COST THEM DEARLY IN DEAD AND WOUNDED.
DEV-MUC3-0719	CLANDESTINE, 13 NOV 89 -- REBEL GUERRILLA UNITS HAVE TAKEN CONTROL OF THE COASTAL RAILROAD LINES NEAR LA CASONA, JIQUILISCO JURISDICTION. THE REBELS HAVE SET UP BARRICADES AND HAVE COMPLETELY PARALYZED VEHICLE TRAFFIC. A RAILROAD BRIDGE BETWEEN TIERRA BLANCA AND JIQUILISCO HAS BEEN PARTIALLY DESTROYED WITH DYNAMITE. THE STRETCH BETWEEN SAN MARCOS LEMPA AND TIERRA BLANCA HAS BEEN CONTROLLED IN THE VICINITY OF THE 14 JULY NEIGHBORHOOD. A REPORT FROM LA PAZ DEPARTMENT SAYS THAT AT 1145 TODAY A SOLDIER FROM THE ARMED FORCES ENGINEERS' MILITARY DETACHMENT FIRED A RIFLE AT A CIVILIAN WOMAN, WOUNDING HER IN THE HEAD. THIS HAPPENED IN THE 27 SEPTEMBER NEIGHBORHOOD IN ZACATECOLUCA, LA PAZ DEPARTMENT. DMIFA SOLDIERS CONTINUE TO INFLICT CASUALTIES AMONG THE CIVILIANS, AS A RESULT OF THEIR DESPERATION. RADIO VENCEREMOS AND RADIO FARABUNDO MARTI IN A NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY NETWORK REPEAT THE REPORT THAT THE AIR FORCE IS STRAFFING THE INCA FACTORY IN SOYAPANGA AND PRADOS DE VENECIA, WHERE IT HAS KILLED 3 AND WOUNDED 12 CIVILIANS. HOMES HAVE BEEN TOTALLY DESTROYED IN PRADOS DE VENECIA AS A RESULT OF THE INDISCRIMINATE STRAFFING BY THE ARMED FORCES. WE HAVE A REPORT FROM THE FELICIANO AMA WESTERN FRONT TO THE EFFECT THAT THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT IS HOLDING POSITIONS IN VILLA LOS NARANJOS AND LA UNION NEIGHBORHOOD IN SANTA ANA. REPORTS ADD THAT REVOLUTIONARY FIGHTING IS TAKING PLACE IN SANTA ANA, WHERE THE FMLN RED AND WHITE FLAG IS BEING HOISTED. GREETINGS TO THE FIGHTERS IN SANTA ANA CITY, AND FORWARD!
DEV-MUC3-0720	SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 -- URGENT. ACCORDING TO AN FMLN FIGHTER WHO TURNED HIMSELF IN TO THE ARMY, HIS COMRADES, THE FMLN TERRORIST CRIMINALS WHO ATTACK THE CIVILIAN POPULATION, ARE WITHOUT AMMUNITION AND FOOD. THUS, TO WIN TIME AND LIFT THE SPIRITS OF COMMANDERS AND WARRIORS THEY RESORT TO LIES AND SAY THEY CONTROL SOME AREAS OF SAN SALVADOR AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. THIS IS TOTALLY FALSE. THE ARMED FORCES CALLS ON CITIZENS TO CONTINUE TO REPUDIATE THESE CRIMINALS, WHO HAVE ONLY BROUGHT PAIN, DEATH, AND UNCERTAINTY WITH THEIR VANDALISTIC ACTIONS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.
DEV-MUC3-0721	SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 -- APPROXIMATELY 100 SALVADORAN ARMY SOLDIERS BEGAN A COUNTEROFFENSIVE AT 1650 WITH ARMORED VEHICLES AND CANONS IN AN EFFORT TO OUST APPROXIMATELY 150 GUERRILLA FIGHTERS WHO HAVE ENTRENCHED THEMSELVES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF MEJICANOS IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR. TWO ARMY COLUMNS WERE DEPLOYED FROM THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE TO MEJICANOS, A DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOOD WITH A POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY 125,000, WHERE THE REBELS HAVE CONTROLLED STRATEGIC POSITIONS SINCE THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT BEGAN "A NATIONAL OFFENSIVE" AGAINST ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S RIGHT-WING GOVERNMENT ON 11 NOVEMBER. LOUD EXPLOSIONS AND HEAVY GUNFIRE IS CURRENTLY HEARD IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA OF SAN SALVADOR, COMING FROM THE MEJICANOS AREA, WHILE THE REBEL STATION RADIO VENCEREMOS HAS URGED ITS FIGHTERS "TO DEFEND EVERY CENTIMETER OF THEIR POSITIONS AND NOT TO TAKE A SINGLE STEP BACKWARD."
DEV-MUC3-0722	CLANDESTINE, 13 NOV 89 -- THE FMLN IS USING DISINFORMATION BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN BEATEN BY THE ARMED FORCES. THE FMLN TODAY RESORTED TO THE STRATEGY OF DISINFORMATION SINCE THEY HAVE BEEN DEFEATED BY OUR BRAVE AND PROFESSIONAL ARMED FORCES. IN A DESPERATE MANNER AND THROUGH THEIR CLANDESTINE RADIO STATION, THE FMLN IS BROADCASTING FALSE REPORTS, SUCH AS THE FOLLOWING. THEY SAID THEY WERE FIGHTING THE ARMED FORCES WITH THE PEOPLE'S SUPPORT THIS MORNING AND THAT THIS OCCURRED 10 BLOCKS FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE. THE FMLN INSISTED THAT CIVILIANS HAD HELPED THEM AT THE REBEL BARRICADES. THIS IS TOTALLY FALSE. THE ARMED FORCES CONTINUE TO PROTECT THE CIVILIAN RESIDENTS OF SAN JACINTO NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE INVENTIONS BROADCAST BY THE FMLN ARE A STRATEGY TO CONFUSE PEOPLE. THE ARMED FORCES CALL ON ALL SALVADORANS NOT TO BE SURPRISED BY THESE STRATEGIES AND TO CONTINUE REPUDIATING THE TERRORIST CRIMINALS, WHO HAVE ONLY BROUGHT AGGRESSION, PAIN, AND GRIEF TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. THE ARMED FORCES CONTROL THE ENTIRE NATIONAL TERRITORY, INCLUDING SAN SALVADOR. THE SHOTS THAT ARE HEARD OR WERE HEARD A FEW HOURS AGO ARE PART OF THE ARMED FORCES DEFENSE AGAINST INDISCRIMINATE FMLN ATTACKS ON THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.
DEV-MUC3-0723	SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 -- 1. GIVEN THE STATE OF SIEGE THAT HAS PREVAILED IN THE COUNTRY SINCE 11 NOVEMBER, AND ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTION, THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IS REQUIRED TO COOPERATE WITH THE ARMED FORCES AND THE VARIOUS SECURITY CORPS WHEN NECESSARY -- MAKING SURE THIS COOPERATION INVOLVES ARMY MEMBERS OR DULY AUTHORIZED JUDICIAL OFFICIALS. 2. UPON LEARNING THAT ARMED TERRORISTS ARE OPERATING NEAR YOUR AREAS OF RESIDENCE, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY CALL TELEPHONE NUMBER 123 OR NOTIFY THE NEAREST MILITARY POST. 3. THE POPULATION MUST REMAIN CALM AND GO TO WORK, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MAKING SURE THAT YOU ARE IN YOUR RESPECTIVE RESIDENCES WHEN THE CURFEW GOES INTO EFFECT AT 1800. 4. THE SALVADORAN POPULATION MUST REMAIN IN THEIR RESIDENCES AND STAY OFF THE STREETS, EVEN UPON HEARING THAT AN ANTISUBVERSIVE OPERATION IS TAKING PLACE NEARBY -- THIS IS PARTICULARLY NECESSARY FOR MINORS. 5. THE SALVADORAN POPULATION ENGAGED IN COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY THE SALE OF STAPLES, MUST REMEMBER THAT THERE IS A DECREE THAT FORBIDS MARKING UP PRICES, SINCE THIS WOULD BE AN ANTIPATRIOTIC ACTION DURING THESE CRUCIAL TIMES FOR THE COUNTRY. 6. THE SALVADORAN POPULATION MUST REMAIN ALERT TO THE INFORMATION BEING ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES, BECAUSE IT WILL BE PROVIDED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND ACCORDING TO THE TRUTH. THE CIVILIAN POPULATION CAN ALSO REST ASSURED THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES ARE EFFICIENTLY AND PROFESSIONALLY CONTROLLING THE GROUPS OF FMLN TERRORIST CRIMINALS. THEREFORE, THE POPULATION MUST REMAIN CALM AND REJECT THE DISINFORMATION BEING ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL SUBVERSION.
DEV-MUC3-0724	SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 -- THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DENOUNCES BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THE MEDDLING OF THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT IN THE ACT OF AGGRESSION AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AT THE HANDS OF FMLN TERRORIST GROUPS. IN A SPEECH ON 12 NOVEMBER, NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA OPENLY MADE IRRESPONSIBLE STATEMENTS REGARDING DEVELOPMENTS IN EL SALVADOR WHICH ARE TOTALLY REMOVED FROM REALITY. PRESIDENT ORTEGA SAID THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS ATTACKING THE PEOPLE WHEN THE TRUTH IS THAT THE FMLN UNLEASHED THIS TERRORIST ESCALATION BY USING WEAPONS AND AMMUNITIONS SUPPLIED BY THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD INVESTIGATE THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT'S MEDDLING IN THIS CRIMINAL ATTACK ON THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE MORE CLOSELY. THE PUBLIC KNOWS THAT MAJOR CRIMES HAVE BEEN PLANNED ON NICARAGUAN TERRITORY, EVEN AGAINST FMLN LEADERS. THE LATE TOP FMLN LEADER, CAYETANO CARPIO, ORDERED THE MURDER OF MELIDA ANAYA MONTES, WHOM THE REBELS CALLED COMMANDER ANA MARIA FROM NICARAGUA. FMLN COMMANDER JOAQUIN VILLALBOS, WHO ORDERED THE MURDER OF MARXIST POET ROQUE DALTON GARCIA, CONTINUES TO LIVE IN NICARAGUA. THE MARXIST - LENINIST CONSPIRACY WHICH WANTS TO SUBJECT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO A TOTALITARIAN DICTATORSHIP IS PLANNED, LED, AND IMPLEMENTED ON NICARAGUAN TERRITORY. HOWEVER, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WHO HAVE SUFFERED FOR MANY YEARS FROM THE BLOODTHIRSTY FMLN ATTACKS, KNOW THAT FMLN IS THE ONE WHO HAS CRUELLY MURDERED CHILDREN, WOMEN, AND THE ELDERLY, AND HAS NOT RESPECTED SEX OR AGE. THIS IS THE FMLN THAT IS MERCILESSLY ATTACKING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. AT PRESENT, THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES ARE FULFILLING THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE TO PROTECT AND DEFEND LIVES AND THE PROPERTIES OF SALVADORAN SOCIETY. THE FMLN HAS FAILED IN ITS TERRORIST OFFENSIVE. IT ENTERED THE CITY, THE WAY ALL COWARDS ENTER TO KILL BY SURPRISE AND IN COLD BLOOD DEFENSELESS PEOPLE. HOWEVER, THE PEOPLE'S ARMED WING, NAMELY, THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, HAVE REPELLED THE AGGRESSORS WHO ARE BEING DIRECTED FROM NICARAGUA WITH PROFESSIONALISM. SO FAR, NOT ONE OF THE COWARDLY FMLN LEADERS HAS SHOWN UP IN SALVADORAN TERRITORY. THESE CRIMINALS HAVE PUSHED THEIR MURDEROUS HOARDES TO INDISCRIMINATELY FIRE AT THE ENTIRE CIVILIAN POPULATION. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE CONDEMNED, REJECTED, AND REPUDIDATED THE FMLN'S TERRORIST ATTACK. THE MURDEROUS LEADERS BELIEVED THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD RALLY BEHIND AND ACCOMPANY THEM IN THEIR FAILED REBELLIOUS OFFENSIVE; THEY TRIED TO HAND OUT WEAPONS IN SOME TOWNS. JUST AS THE PEOPLE TURNED THEIR BACKS ON THE TERRORISTS AT THE POLLS, THEY REJECT THEM NOW ONCE AGAIN BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THE FMLN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR HUNGER, POVERTY, AND SUFFERING. TO THE FREE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD WHO RESPECT THE PRINCIPLE OF NONINTERVENTION IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF STATES, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT DEMAND THE CONDEMNATION OF THE MEDDLING BY THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT WITH ITS LOGISTICAL SUPPORT TO THE FMLN AND THAT NICARAGUA STOPS LENDING ITS TERRITORY FOR THE AGGRESSION AGAINST THIS NATION THAT WANTS TO LIVE PEACEFULLY IN DEMOCRACY BASED ON A RESPECT FOR THE LAW AND FULL LIBERTY.
DEV-MUC3-0725	SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 -- COLONEL PONCE, WHAT IS THE CURRENT MILITARY SITUATION IN SAN SALVADOR AND IN THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS? GOOD EVENING, SALVADORAN PEOPLE. THE ARMED FORCES WANT TO PUBLICLY RECOGNIZE AND THANK THE PEOPLE FOR THEIR COOPERATION DURING THIS TIME WHEN THE FMLN TERRORIST HORDES ARE CARRYING OUT AN ARMED AGGRESSION AGAINST ALL OF OUR PEOPLE. THE SITUATION IN SAN SALVADOR CAN BE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: FIGHTING IS ONGOING IN THE NORTHERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR -- IN MEJICANOS, CUSCATANCINGO, AND THE ZACAMIL AREAS. THERE ARE ALSO SOME CLASHES IN THE NORTHWESTERN AREA OF SOYAPANGO, IN THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS OF BOSQUES DEL RIO, MONTE FRESCO, EL PETETE, AND SAN JOSE. THERE IS SOME SPORADIC FIGHTING IN CIUDAD CREDISA, AS WELL AS IN SANTA MARTA. THAT IS WHAT WE CAN TELL YOU AT THIS MOMENT ABOUT THE FIGHTING IN THE AREA OF SAN SALVADOR. IN THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS, ON SATURDAY, 11 NOVEMBER, THERE WAS FIGHTING IN SAN MIGUEL, SANTA ANA, ZACATECOLUCA, USULUTAN, AND SOME SPORADIC FIGHTING IN CHALATENANGO. OF ALL THESE PLACES, THE TERRORISTS INCREASED THEIR AGGRESSION TODAY ONLY IN ZACATECOLUCA. THE TERRORISTS, UNFORTUNATELY, TOOK OVER THE HOSPITAL IN ZACATECOLUCA, KILLING ONE SOLDIER WHO WAS RECEIVING MEDICAL TREATMENT. THE ARMED FORCES HAVE REGAINED CONTROL OF THE FIRST AND SECOND FLOORS OF THE HOSPITAL. APPROXIMATELY 10 TO 15 TERRORISTS ARE ON THE THIRD AND FOURTH FLOORS, AND THE TROUBLE IS THAT THERE ARE SICK PEOPLE ON THOSE FLOORS. SO, WE BELIEVE THAT THE ARMED AGGRESSION, THE INDISCRIMINATE TERRORISM THAT THE FMLN HAS LAUNCHED AT THIS TIME IN AN IRRATIONAL MANNER AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, HAS BEEN CONTROLLED. THE ARMED FORCES ARE FIGHTING IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER AGAINST THESE TERRORISTS. TO SUM UP, WE COULD THEN SAY THAT THERE ARE ONLY A FEW GUERRILLA RESISTANCE POCKETS IN THE AREAS THAT YOU HAVE MENTIONED. THIS CONTRADICTS THE REPORTS FROM THE CLANDESTINE RADIO STATIONS TO THE EFFECT THAT THEY CONTROL CERTAIN AREAS. I MUST ALSO ADD THAT THERE IS ALSO SOME FIGHTING IN CIUDAD DELGADO. I CAN CATEGORICALLY STATE THAT THE FMLN DOES NOT CONTROL ANY POINT IN OUR NATIONAL TERRITORY. THEY ARE SHOUTING ABROAD THAT THEY CONTROL CERTAIN POINTS IN SAN SALVADOR. THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES, THE MEDIA, AND THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS ARE WITNESSES TO THE FACT THE FMLN DOES NOT CONTROL ANY PLACES IN SAN SALVADOR OR IN THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS. THERE ARE STILL SOME FMLN REDOUBTS, WHICH WE ARE CURRENTLY CONTROLLING IN ORDER TO EXPEL FROM THE URBAN AREAS THE TERRORISTS WHO ARE ATTACKING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. NATURALLY, WE HAVE SOME COMBAT LIMITATIONS IN THE URBAN AREAS, BECAUSE THE TERRORISTS ARE SHIELDING THEMSELVES BEHIND THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AND ARE HOLDING MANY FAMILIES HOSTAGES IN THEIR OWN HOMES. THE TERRORISTS HAVE ALSO PLACED SNIPERS ON SOME TALL BUILDINGS. THAT IS WHY THE ARMED FORCES ARE ASKING FOR THE PEOPLE'S UNDERSTANDING. IF WE WERE TO USE OUR MILITARY POWER, AS WE COULD DO IN A COMBAT ZONE, WE WOULD KILL MANY INNOCENT PEOPLE.
DEV-MUC3-0726	SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 -- AND WE NOT WANT TO DO THAT. WE WANT TO RESOLVE THIS SITUATION IN A CAUTIOUS WAY, ALWAYS RESPECTING AND PROTECTING OUR CIVILIAN POPULATION. THAT IS WHY WE ASK THOSE PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED OR ARE BEING HELD HOSTAGE BY TERRORISTS TO BE PATIENT. THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES ARE MAKING AN EFFORT TO REACH ALL THE AREAS WHERE THIS SITUATION PREVAILS SO THAT WE CAN RESCUE ALL OF OUR SALVADORAN BROTHERS. THESE REMARKS ARE INTENDED TO REVEAL THE PROFESSIONAL NATURE OF THE ARMED FORCES AND REAFFIRM SOMETHING MANY SALVADORANS HAVE IN MIND. REGARDING THIS MILITARY OFFENSIVE, HAS THE FMLN RECEIVED MILITARY AND PERSONNEL AID FROM ABROAD? SURE, NICARAGUA HAS ALWAYS SUPPORTED THE FMLN. PRESIDENT ORTEGA IS DOING THIS . THE NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER, WHO IS CURRENTLY IN MEXICO, IS GIVING HIS FULL SUPPORT TO THE FMLN. HE SAYS THAT THE REVOLUTIONARY FORCES HAVE ALREADY ACHIEVED THEIR VICTORY IN EL SALVADOR. THE FMLN ARE LIARS. THEY FOLLOW THE SAME COMMUNISTS' SLOGANS: LIE, LIE, AND LIE. HERE NO ONE BELIEVES THAT. A TRUCK LOADED WITH WEAPONS IN SANTA ANA WAS DRIVEN BY AN EAST GERMAN. SOME OF THE CAPTURED PEOPLE ARE FOREIGNERS. I CANNOT TELL YOU WHERE THEY COME FROM. YOUR REMARKS CONFIRM THE PRESENCE OF MERCENARIES IN THE CURRENT ARMED STRUGGLE, WHICH WOULD BE.... I CAN ALSO ADD THAT WE RECEIVED INFORMATION BEFORE 10 NOVEMBER THAT A GROUP OF TERRORIST FIGHTERS HAD COME TO THE COUNTRY'S EASTERN ZONE FROM NICARAGUA. THEY MAY BE PARTICIPATING IN THIS TERRORIST ACTION. AS FOR THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CASUALTIES INFLICTED ON THE FMLN NOW, CAN YOU TELL HOW MANY FMLN REBELS HAVE DIED IN THIS OFFENSIVE? NATIONWIDE, WE COUNTED 230 TERRORISTS KILLED, AND 136 TERRORIST WOUNDED; 72 TERRORIST WERE CAPTURED. ONE TERRORIST WAS PRESENTED TO THE PRESS. CAN THE NUMBER OF CIVILIANS KILLED AND WOUNDED BE TOTALLED NOW? THAT IS THE MOST REGRETTABLE ASPECT OF THIS IRRATIONAL FMLN ACTION. THIS ACTION HAS IMPERILED THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT INVOLVED IN THE ARMED UPRISING. WE REGRET THAT 17 PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND 86 HAVE BEEN WOUNDED. THIS FIGURE IS REALLY REGRETTABLE. MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TUNED INTO THIS NATIONAL NETWORK. WE HAVE HEARD MANY TELEPHONE CALLS REITERATING SUPPORT FOR THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES' ACTIONS. IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY IN AREAS WHERE THE CURFEW WAS ORDERED. WHAT SUGGESTIONS CAN YOU OFFER PEOPLE IN THE CAPITAL CITY? TO REPORT AN EMERGENCY THEY CAN DIAL 3 IF THEY HAVE A TELEPHONE AVAILABLE. OTHERWISE, OR IF THEY DO NOT HAVE A TELEPHONE, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY LEAVE THEIR HOMES WITH THEIR ARMS UP CARRYING SOME WHITE FLAG OR CLOTH AND GO TO A NEARBY UNIT TO GET AID. PEOPLE MUST KEEP IN MIND THE ARMED FORCES ARE THE FRIENDS OF THE PEOPLE AND WILL SERVE THE PEOPLE. TRUST AND GO TO YOUR ARMED FORCES. THESE WERE THE REMARKS OF COL RENE EMILIO PONCE. HE IS NOW LEAVING THIS NATIONAL RADIO NETWORK. I CAN TELL YOU THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF WEAPONS HAVE BEEN SEIZED. WE CAN CONFIRM THE MEDDLING OF SOME COMMUNIST BLOC COUNTRIES IN THIS. WE SEIZED RUSSIAN AND NORTH KOREAN WEAPONS WHICH PROBABLY ENTERED THROUGH CUBA AND NICARAGUA. I CAN ALSO TELL YOU THAT SINCE THE FMLN FIRED MORTARS FROM THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY MORNING, WE HAD TO REMOVE THE TERRORISTS FROM SEVERAL POINTS. WE FOUND WEAPONS, EXPLOSIVES, AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF MEDICINE INSIDE THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY. SOME MEN WERE KILLED WITH THEIR RIFLES IN THEIR HANDS; WE ALSO CAPTURED OTHERS WHO WERE INSIDE THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY. I ALSO WANT TO ASK THE CIVILIAN POPULATION FOR ITS UNDERSTANDING AND TO TRUST THEIR ARMED FORCES. THESE ARMED FORCES BELONG TO THE PEOPLE AND SERVE THEM. WE ARE ACTING IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER. BE PATIENT, REMAIN CALM, AND WE WILL MOVE AHEAD WITH GOD'S BLESSING AND HELP. ALSO, I WANT TO PUBLICLY RECOGNIZE THE MILITARY CHIEFS, OFFICERS, ENLISTED MEN, SECURITY CORPS OFFICIALS, AND ALL THE ARMED FORCES' ACTIVE PERSONNEL FOR THEIR HEROIC WORK IN DEFENDING OUR PEOPLE, DEMOCRACY, LIBERTY, AND PEACE. YOUR ACTIONS HAVE BEEN HEROIC, AND ALL OF US RECOGNIZE THIS. MAY HISTORY DO YOU JUSTICE TOMORROW. YOU MUST FEEL PROUD BECAUSE YOU ARE DOING WHAT EVERY PATRIOT MUST DO, DEFEND THE FATHERLAND.
DEV-MUC3-0727	SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 -- THE SALVADORAN ARMY'S COUNTERATTACK AGAINST REBEL POSITIONS IN MEJICANOS, ON THE NORTHERN SIDE OF THE CAPITAL CITY, WAS SUSPENDED AT 1745 , 1 HOUR AFTER IT BEGAN AND SO FAR THERE ARE NO REPORTS ON THE RESULTS OF IT. TWO COLUMNS OF SOME 100 SALVADORAN ARMY TROOPS, ARMED WITH RIFLES AND ARTILLERY WEAPONS, STARTED TO ATTACK ABOUT 150 GUERRILLAS WHO CONTROL AMPLE POSITIONS IN MEJICANOS WHERE SOME 125,000 PEOPLE LIVE. DURING THAT HOUR, STRONG EXPLOSIONS WERE HEARD NEAR MEJICANOS; THEY LATER STOPPED WHEN A HEAVY RAIN FELL FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES. THERE ARE NO TELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE AREA; THEREFORE, IT HAS BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE BALANCE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S COUNTERATTACK. MEANWHILE, IT WAS REPORTED THAT IN THE CONACASTE NEIGHBORHOOD OF SOYAPANGO, ALSO IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, FIVE PRIVATE HOMES WERE STRAFFED BY ARMY HELICOPTERS. THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED YET. ACCORDING TO THE U.S. EMBASSY IN SAN SALVADOR, THE NATIONAL OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED ON 12 NOVEMBER BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT AGAINST ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S RIGHTIST GOVERNMENT HAS RESULTED IN 305 DEAD AND 373 WOUNDED, INCLUDING GUERRILLAS, SOLDIERS, AND CIVILIANS.
DEV-MUC3-0728	CLANDESTINE, 14 NOV 89 -- SINCE 1981 THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT HAS BEEN INSISTING ON THE NEED FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE WAR. ITS EFFORTS MET WITH THE STUBBORN OPPOSITION OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THE COUNTRY'S ULTRARIGHTIST SECTORS, WHO ARE THE ONES WHO IN REALITY HAVE WIELDED TOTAL POWER. WE PRESENTED DOZENS OF NEGOTIATING PROPOSALS IN WHICH WE INCREASINGLY MADE OUR POSITIONS MORE FLEXIBLE, EVEN THOUGH THE MILITARY REALITY DEMONSTRATED THAT WE WERE INVINCIBLE. WE PRESENTED TO THE CURRENT NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE GOVERNMENT A PROPOSAL THAT HAD REAL POSSIBILITIES OF BRINGING ABOUT PEACE. HOWEVER, THE RESPONSE WE RECEIVED WAS AN ESCALATION OF REPRESSION BY MEANS OF TORTURE AND MURDER, WHICH CULMINATED WITH THE MASSACRE OF THE WORKERS OF THE SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION . THE GOVERNMENT REJECTED OUR FORMULAS FOR NEGOTIATION IN WORD AND IN DEED, AND INSTEAD DEEPENED THE CAUSES BEHIND THE WAR BY WORSENING THE SOCIAL CRISIS AND REDUCING THE RANGE OF ACTIVITY OF THE POPULAR SECTORS. FACED WITH A DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT THREATENED NOT ONLY TO SHUT OFF A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE WAR, BUT INSTEAD TO INCREASE THE KILLINGS AND OTHER FLAGRANT VIOLATIONS OF OUR PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS, THE FMLN DECIDED TO LAUNCH A FORCEFUL AND STRATEGIC MILITARY OFFENSIVE THAT WOULD PUT A HALT TO THE FASCISTS AND OPEN UP A POSSIBILITY TO BRING AN END TO THE WAR. CONSEQUENTLY, AT 2000 ON 11 NOVEMBER OUR FORCES ENTERED INTO COMBAT AGAINST ALL THE TARGETS DESIGNATED IN OUR OFFENSIVE PLAN, DESPITE ALL THE PREVENTIVE MEASURES AND ARRANGEMENTS SET UP BY THE ARMY TO TRY TO HALT US. OUR EXPERIENCED FIGHTERS, IN SPITE OF THE DISADVANTAGE IN FORCES AND ARMS, HAVE FULFILLED OUR GOALS BEYOND OUR EXPECTATIONS, CARRYING OUT ONE OF THE MOST GLORIOUS MILITARY BATTLES IN THE HISTORY OF THE PEOPLE'S WAR. IN UNDER 15 HOURS, WE GAINED CONTROL OVER STRATEGIC TERRITORIES, WIPED OUT DOZENS OF ENEMY TROOPS, TOOK PRISONERS, RECOVERED WEAPONS, AND DESTROYED ARMORED VEHICLES AND AIRPLANES. AFTER 4 CONTINUOUS DAYS OF FIGHTING, OUR FORCES HAVE REJECTED ALL COUNTERATTACKS BY THE ENEMY AND HAVE GAINED NEW POSITIONS. THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS OF THE CITIES HAVE STAGED POPULAR UPRISINGS TO SUPPORT OUR FORCES, WHICH HAVE BEEN AUGMENTED BY NEW FIGHTERS. FACED WITH THIS SITUATION, THE ARENA GOVERNMENT AND THE CLIQUE OF CORRUPT MILITARY OFFICERS KNOWN AS LA TANDONA WHO COMMAND THE ARMED FORCES, HAVE ORDERED CRIMINAL BOMBINGS OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION WITH THE PURPOSE OF PUTTING DOWN THE POPULAR UPRISINGS. THIS HAS BROUGHT ABOUT MORE SUPPORT FOR OUR FORCES AND REDOUBLED THE PEOPLE'S RAGE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT LED BY CRISTIANI AND THE ARMY. A SITUATION HAS THUS COME ABOUT WHICH DEMANDS THAT OUR FORCES CARRY OUT THE DECISION TO CONTINUE THE OFFENSIVE THAT OUR FORCES AND THE PEOPLE HAVE UNLEASHED UNTIL ITS FINAL CONSEQUENCES.
DEV-MUC3-0729	CLANDESTINE, 14 NOV 89 -- PEACE IS POSSIBLE ONLY IF WE EVICT FROM POWER THOSE WHO HAVE PROFITED FROM WAR. CONSEQUENTLY, THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND: 1. ORDERS THAT ALL OUR UNITS MUST HOLD THE POSITIONS CONQUERED, ORGANIZE THE GENERAL UPRISING OF OUR PEOPLE, AND CARRY OUT ALL THE TASKS DEALING WITH THE POPULATION'S SECURITY AND DEFENSE AND THE COLLECTION OF FOOD AND ITS DISTRIBUTION TO THE NEEDY. 2. CALLS THE PEOPLE TO A GENERAL UPRISING SO THEY CAN JOIN US IN BATTLE IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY WITH ALL TYPES OF WEAPONS TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AND STRIKE THE ENEMY. 3. ANNOUNCES THAT, EFFECTIVE AS SOON AS THIS MANIFESTO IS ANNOUNCED, WE DECLARE AS TERRITORIES LIBERATED BY THE PEOPLE ALL THE AREAS UNDER OUR CONTROL IN MORAZAN, SAN MIGUEL, LA UNION, USULUTAN, CUSCATLAN, CHALATENANGO, SAN VICENTE, AND CABANAS DEPARTMENTS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS, OUR FORCES AND THE PEOPLE WILL ORGANIZE POPULAR GOVERNMENTS IN EVERY MUNICIPALITY IN THESE DEPARTMENTS. SIMULTANEOUSLY, OUR FORCES THAT CONTROL TERRITORIES IN THE CITIES MUST INTENSIFY THE STRUGGLE TO ENSURE TOTAL CONTROL OF THE COUNTRY. 4. URGES ALL THE WORKERS TO STOP WORKING AS PART OF THE GENERALIZED STRUGGLE, WHICH WILL HELP WEAKEN THE JANUARY GOVERNMENT AND WILL ENABLE ALL TO JOIN US IN COMBAT. THEREFORE, WE HEREBY ANNOUNCE THAT THE CURRENT TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE, THE SABOTAGING OF THE ENERGY SUPPLY, AND THE CLOSING OF GASOLINE STATIONS WILL CONTINUE FOR AN INDEFINITE TIME. FOR THIS REASON, THE PEOPLE MUST PREPARE FOR THIS SITUATION. WE STERNLY WARN THOSE EMPLOYERS WHO FORCE THEIR WORKERS TO GO TO WORK THAT OUR FORCES HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO IMPOSE OBEDIENCE TO THIS MEASURE. 5. ASKS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS TO SEND HELP TO THE CIVILIAN VICTIMS OF BOMBINGS AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE CREATION OF REFUGES AND CENTERS TO PROTECT THE POPULATION FROM THE CRIMINAL ACTIONS UNLEASHED BY CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND. 6. URGENTLY CALLS ALL POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES, POPULAR ORGANIZATIONS, AND PRIVATE BUSINESSMEN IN OUR COUNTRY TO ASSUME AT THIS TIME THE HISTORIC ROLE OF MAKERS AND BUILDERS OF A NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC SOLUTION THAT CAN BRING LASTING PEACE TO OUR COUNTRY. 7. MAKES A PATRIOTIC EXHORTATION TO OFFICERS AND THE RANK AND FILE OF THE ARMY NOT TO LET THE BIG BATCH , ARENA, AND THE U.S. INTERESTS LEAD THEM TO CONFRONT THE PEOPLE, THUS STAINING THEIR HANDS WITH BLOOD. THE FMLN DOES NOT REGARD THEM AS ENEMIES AND IS READY TO MAKE PEACE WITH THE ARMY SECTORS WHO DESIRE JUSTICE, SOVEREIGNTY, AND TRUE DEMOCRACY FOR OUR PEOPLE. THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE AND ALL OF OUR COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL FORCES IS LA TANDONA, WHO HAVE ENRICHED THEMSELVES WITH WAR, AND THE ARENA DEATH SQUADS. THEY ARE THE ENEMIES OF PEACE AND DEMOCRACY. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO DO NOT WANT A REGIME OF JUSTICE. WE CALL ALL THE NATION TO FIGHT THEM SO WE CAN SING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, WHICH THE TYRANNY HAS TRIED TO BURY, AND WHICH SAYS: FREEDOM IS ITS DOGMA AND GUIDELINE, WHICH IT HAS SWORN TO DEFEND A THOUSAND TIMES, AND JUST AS MANY TIMES, HAS SWORN TO REJECT THE HATEFUL POWER OF A BOLD TYRANNY. FMLN GENERAL COMMANDERS SALVADOR SANCHEZ SEREN, EDUARDO SANCHO, FRANCISCO JOVEL, SHAFIK JORGE HANDAL, JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS. EL SALVADOR, 13 NOVEMBER 1989.

WHEREAS THE SITUATION OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE IS MARKED BY THE INCREASING ARMED STRUGGLE AND FLAGRANT VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND MAN'S FUNDAMENTAL LIBERTIES: THE ENORMOUS HUMAN SUFFERING CAUSED BY THIS SITUATION HAS RESULTED IN THE LOSS OF NUMEROUS CIVILIAN LIVES AS AN EFFECT OF THE INDISCRIMINATE REPRESSION ON THE NONCOMBATANT POPULATION. ACCORDING TO ARTICLE 2, PARAGRAPH A OF THE OAS CHARTER, AMENDED BY THE CARTAGENA PROTOCOL, ONE OF THE ORGANIZATION'S MAIN PURPOSES IS TO STRENGTHEN PEACE AND SECURITY IN THE CONTINENT. SOLIDARITY AMONG AMERICAN STATES MAKES IT AN URGENT MATTER THAT THE ORGANIZATION DEVOTES SPECIAL AND CONSIDERABLE EFFORTS TO HELP ACHIEVE A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION OF THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT AND TO END THE BLOODSHED. THEREFORE: 1. WE URGENTLY CALL ON THE SALVADORAN REGIME TO IMMEDIATELY STOP THE BOMBINGS OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AND THE ACTS OF REPRESSION LIKE AT SAN SALVADOR UNIVERSITY. 2. WE MAKE AN APPEAL SO THAT THE HOSTILITIES CAN BE STOPPED IMMEDIATELY, THE WOUNDED CAN BE EVACUATED, AND THE CIVILIAN POPULATION CAN BE SUPPLIED WITH STAPLES IN FULL SECURITY. 3. WE APPEAL TO THE SIDES IN CONFLICT THAT NEGOTIATIONS BE IMMEDIATELY INITIATED THROUGH THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE OAS, LEADING TO A CEASE - FIRE UNDER CONDITIONS THAT ENSURE FULL RESPECT FOR ALL HUMAN RIGHTS. 4. WE URGE MAKING THE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS SO THE UN OBSERVERS FOR CENTRAL AMERICA , CREATED BY THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL ON 7 NOVEMBER 1989, CAN GO TO EL SALVADOR IMMEDIATELY TO A) MAKE SURE THERE IS NO FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT, WHICH COULD PREVENT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO FULL AND UNRESTRICTED SELF-DETERMINATION; B) ENFORCE THE PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW REGARDING HUMANITARIANISM, PARTICULARLY ARTICLE 3 OF THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS SIGNED IN 1949, WHICH DEAL WITH EXPENDITURES DUE TO WAR, PROTECTION OF CIVILIANS, AND . 5.

THE FMLN TERRORISTS WHO ARE MAKING A DESPERATE RETREAT FROM THE SUBURBS OF SAN SALVADOR HAVE ABANDONED 27 OF THEIR DEAD COMRADES IN CIUDAD CREDISA. THESE PEOPLE SHED THEIR BLOOD IN VAIN FOR IDEALS THAT DO NOT TRULY SEEK THE WELFARE OF SALVADORANS, BUT INSTEAD THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OPPROBIOUS AND TOTALITARIAN DICTATORSHIP THAT THE FMLN TERRORISTS WOULD LIKE TO IMPOSE. THERE IS NO PLACE FOR THE FMLN HERE IN EL SALVADOR. IT HAS ALWAYS HAD A WARLIKE, VIOLENT POSITION OPPOSED TO THE INTERESTS OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.

JULIO CESAR PORTILLO, LEADER OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF SALVADORAN WORKERS , AT THE SAME TIME DENIED THAT THE LABOR LEADERS HAD TAKEN REFUGE IN THE MEXICAN EMBASSY, AND AFFIRMED THAT "WE ARE WORKING, TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION." ACCORDING TO PORTILLO, THE CLOSEDOWN COULD LEAD TO A GENERAL STRIKE IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS TO "DEFEND THE WORKERS AND COMPEL THE GOVERNMENT TO NEGOTIATE A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THIS WAR." THE LEADER OF THE UNTS, WHICH THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS IS A FRONT FOR THE GUERRILLAS, ASKED ALL THE WORKERS TO STAY HOME AND SAID: "WE DEMAND THAT THE GOVERNMENT IMMEDIATELY HALT ALL ACTIVITIES THAT ARE AFFECTING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION." PORTILLO SAID THAT A GENERAL STRIKE HAS NOT YET BEEN CALLED, BUT DID NOT RULE ONE OUT IF "THE REPRESSION AND THE INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING OF THE PEOPLE" CONTINUE. AT A NEWS CONFERENCE, THE LABOR LEADER SAID THAT "THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HAVE THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL. THE CRISIS IS DEEPENING." PORTILLO SAID THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF WORKERS -- ESPECIALLY IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE NORTHERN AND EASTERN PART OF THE CITY WHERE THE FIERCEST CLASHES ARE TAKING PLACE -- WHO DO NOT HAVE FOOD OR MEDICINE AND WHO ARE LIVING UNDER DANGEROUS CONDITIONS, IN THE MIDST OF FIREFIGHTS.

THE LEADER WARNED THAT STORES AND SUPERMARKETS MIGHT BE SACKED AND SAID THAT THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED SATURDAY EVENING "IS THE LARGEST EVER SINCE THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR BEGAN." PORTILLO SAID THAT "WE WORKERS HAVE TO SEE TO IT THAT A TRULY DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT CAN COME TO POWER IN EL SALVADOR," BUT ADDED THAT HE HAS NO INFORMATION REGARDING A RUMOR SPREAD TODAY IN SAN SALVADOR THAT THE GUERRILLAS OR SOME POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS HAD ANNOUNCED THE FORMATION OF A PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT. THE FMLN GUERRILLAS, WHO ARE BATTLING FIERCELY AGAINST GOVERNMENT TROOPS IN DENSELY POPULATED AREAS OF SAN SALVADOR AS WELL AS IN TOWNS IN THE INTERIOR, TODAY ANNOUNCED THAT SEVERAL AREAS IN EIGHT OF EL SALVADOR'S 14 DEPARTMENTS WERE "LIBERATED TERRITORIES."
DEV-MUC3-0738	CLANDESTINE, 14 NOV 89 -- OUR FORCES HAVE ALSO ENGAGED TROOPS POSTED AT THE PRESIDENTE HOTEL AND IN ITS VICINITY, BUT ONCE AGAIN RESPECTED THE U.S. AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE. DURING THE ENTIRE MANEUVER WE INFLICTED APPROXIMATELY 20 CASUALTIES ON THE ENEMY, BUT WE DID NOT LOSE ANY MEN. MEANWHILE, WE HAVE HAD REPORTS FROM SAN SALVADOR THAT THE AIR FORCE IS BOMBING HEAVILY DENSELY POPULATED AREAS IN THE SECTOR OF CIUDAD DELGADO. COMMANDER CARLOS ANNOUNCED THIS AT A NEWS CONFERENCE IN SAN SALVADOR: A GOVERNMENT THAT BOMBS THE PEOPLE IS AN ILLEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT; A GOVERNMENT FACING THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS IN ARMS IS AN ILLEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT; AND A GOVERNMENT THAT MASSACRES THE PEOPLE IS AN ILLEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT; AND AN ILLEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT MUST BE TOPPLED BY OUR FORCES. NOW, WE HAVE A LAST-MINUTE REPORT FROM SAN SALVADOR. AT THIS VERY MOMENT, AN O-2 AIRPLANE IS THROWING ROCKETS AT THE AREA OF ZACAMIL, WHERE HEAVY FIGHTING IS UNDER WAY. IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT THERE HAVE BEEN CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN THIS ATTACK. IT HAS ALSO BEEN CONFIRMED THAT THE THREE ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS THAT WERE DESTROYED IN ZACAMIL WERE DESTROYED ON THE STREET THAT JOINS THE ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THE METROPOLI NEIGHBORHOOD. IN ANOTHER REPORT FROM OUR COMPANEROS IN SOYAPANGO, THEY HAVE INFORMED US THAT THEY HAVE SEEN A U.S. ADVISER LEADING THE TROOPS IN THE SECTOR OF SOYAPANGO. IT IS PRESUMED THAT THIS NORTH AMERICAN IS THE ONE WHO IS DIRECTING THE AIR ATTACK IN THE SECTOR OF SOYAPANGO. C-47 AIRPLANES AS WELL AS UH-1M, HUEY 500, AND UH-1H HELICOPTERS, ALL U.S. MADE, HAVE BEEN THROWING ROCKETS ON AND MACHINEGUNNING THE SECTORS OF SOYAPANGO AND CIUDAD DELGADO. THE FASCIST REGIME OF LA TANDONA , CRISTIANI, AND D'AUBUISSON HAVE DECREED A CURFEW IN ALL OF THE AREAS UNDER THE CONTROL OF OUR FORCES IN THE NORTHERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO WITNESSES OF THEIR INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING. WE ISSUE AN URGENT CALL TO THE RED CROSS AND OTHER HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS TO GO TO SOYAPANGO, WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN DOZENS OF CIVILIAN CASUALTIES. WE ALSO ISSUE AN URGENT APPEAL TO THE DEMOCRATIC LATIN AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS SO THAT THEY CAN THE FASCIST GOVERNMENT OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI, TO GET HIM TO STOP THIS INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING ONCE AND FOR ALL. A REPORT FROM THE CAPITAL STATES THAT FMLN FORCES THIS AFTERNOON ARE ATTACKING ZACAMIL BATTALION POSITIONS AND HARRASSING THE ARMED FORCES' JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF. ON THIS 4TH DAY OF FIGHTING IN THE CAPITAL, ROADBLOCKS CONTINUE TO MULTIPLY THROUGHOUT. THIS IS THE SECOND ATTACK ON THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS. AS REPORTED ON THE EVENING OF 13 NOVEMBER, WE ATTACKED THE SAN BENITO BATTALION AT THE NATIONAL FAIR GROUNDS AND THE FORCES GUARDING THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF. THIS IS THE SECOND HARRASSMENT ATTACK ON THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF. THIS COMPLICATES THE ARMED FORCES' SITUATION IN THE CAPITAL BECAUSE THE ENEMY ARMED FORCES' TOP LEADERSHIP IS BEING ATTACKED AND HARRASSED. FMLN FORCES ARE BESIEGING THE ENEMY. AIR FORCE AIRCRAFTS CONTINUE TO OVERFLY THE NORTHERN AREA OF THE CAPITAL THIS AFTERNOON. THEY CONTINUE TO MACHINEGUN AND BOMB THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. MOMENTS AGO, WE REPORTED THAT THERE WAS HEAVY BOMBING IN ZACAMIL AGAINST THE POPULATION. WE CALL ON THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS COMMITTEE TO GO IMMEDIATELY TO ZACAMIL TO EVACUATE CIVILIANS WHO MIGHT HAVE SURVIVED THESE COWARDLY AND BLOODY AIR FORCE BOMBINGS.
DEV-MUC3-0739	CLANDESTINE, 14 NOV 89 -- WE HAVE A REPORT FROM OUR COMMANDING POST IN SAN SALVADOR. WE HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH COMMANDER CLAUDIO RABINDRANATH ARMIJO. BECAUSE OF CERTAIN PROBLEMS WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS, THE QUESTIONS WILL NOT BE CLEAR, BUT THE ANSWERS WILL BE. COMMANDER CLAUDIO RABINDRANATH ARMIJO, WE ARE INTERVIEWING YOU FROM RADIO VENCEREMOS HERE IN MORAZAN DEPARTMENT. WE HAVE HEARD REPORTS FROM CENTRAL AMERICAN RADIO STATIONS SPEAKING ABOUT ROCKET FIRE AND BOMBINGS IN ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD. COULD YOU TELL US ABOUT THE CURRENT SITUATION? WE HAVE BEEN HOLDING OUR POSITION FOR ABOUT 3 DAYS . CURRENTLY, THERE IS ROCKET AND MACHINEGUN FIRE BEING LAUNCED AGAINST OUR POSITIONS. THE ENEMY IS DESPERATE. THIS MORNING WE REPELLED AN ATTACK. THEY FLED IN DISARRAY BECAUSE NO ONE CAME TO SUPPORT THEM. THE FASCIST DISINFORMATION NETWORK HAS BEEN SAYING THAT THE PEOPLE ARE NOT SUPPORTING THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT . WHAT IS THE PEOPLE'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE FMLN FIGHTERS IN ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD? THEIR CONDUCT HAS BEEN POSITIVE. THEY HAVE BEEN HELPING US TREAT THE WOUNDED. THEY HAVE HELPED US WITH FOOD PROBLEMS. THEY HAVE SUPPORTED US COMPLETELY BY PLACING BARRICADES ON THE STREETS. THE PEOPLE'S SUPPORT IN THIS AREA IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE ENEMY'S PSYCHOLOGICAL WAR IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. WE HAVE RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM OUR COMRADES IN SOYAPANGO WHO SAY THAT THEY HAVE SEEN A U.S. ADVISER LEADING ENEMY TROOPS IN SAN SALVADOR. HAVE ANY OF YOUR MEN SEEN ANY U.S. ADVISERS? NOT SEEN THEM, BUT . WHAT IS THE MORALE OF THE FMLN TROOPS PARTICULARLY IN THE ZACAMIL AREA? THE FASCIST INFORMATION NETWORK HAS BEEN SAYING THAT FMLN TROOPS ARE LEAVING THEIR POSTS. THEIR MORALE IS HIGH. WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY THE PEOPLE'S SUPPORT. WE ARE VERY DETERMINED. THE ENEMY'S ATTACKS HAVE BEEN REPELLED. COULD YOU SEND A MESSAGE TO FMLN TROOPS IN ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD AND TO THOSE IN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE CAPITAL AS WELL AS TO FMLN FIGHTERS HOLDING THEIR POSITIONS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY? THE PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY SUPPORTING US. WE ARE WAGING ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BATTLES IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. THE OUTLOOK FOR VICTORY DEPENDS ON WHAT EACH OF US DOES. WE MUST KEEP MOVING FORWARD. THIS HAS BEEN A RECORDED INTERVIEW. WE INTERVIEWED COMMANDER CLAUDIO RABINDRANATH ARMIJO A FEW MINUTES AGO. HE IS CURRENTLY AT A COMMAND POST IN SAN SALVADOR.
DEV-MUC3-0740	SAN SALVADOR, 14 NOV 89 -- ATTENTION, ATTENTION, SALVADORAN PEOPLE. THIS IS CADENA NACIONAL, THE NETWORK OF FREEDOM, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S NETWORK. ATTENTION, SALVADORAN PEOPLE: THE TERRORIST HORDES OF THE FARBUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN) HAVE BEEN DEFEATED BY OUR BRAVE ARMED FORCES, WHO HAVE GONE OUT TO DEFEND OUR SOVEREIGNTY, INTEGRITY, AND THE LIVES AND PROPERTIES OF ALL SALVADORANS. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE SUPPORTING THEIR ARMED FORCES AND PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI. AT THIS TIME, THE FMLN CRIMINALS ARE RECEIVING THE PUNISHEMENT THEY DESERVE THROUGH THE GLORIOUS WEAPONS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES. THE COWARDLY FMLN TERRORIST GROUPS HAVE BEEN HIDING SINCE 11 NOVEMBER IN THE HOMES OF DEFENSELESS CIVILIANS. THEY ARE COWARDS. THEY ARE LIKE THOSE COWARD CRIMINALS WHO AFTER COMMITTING MURDER RUN TO HIDE BEHIND A WOMAN'S SKIRT. THAT IS WHAT THOSE TERRORISTS ARE DOING. THEY ARE HIDING UNDER THE BEDS OF THE POPULATION, WHICH IS SUFFERING BECAUSE OF THE TERRORISTS' ATTACKS. THEY ARE COWARDS WHO HAVE TREACHEROUSLY ATTACKED AND BOMBED THE PEOPLE. A FEW HOURS AGO, THE LIAR TERRORIST JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, FROM HIS HOTEL ROOM IN MANAGUA -- WHERE HE HAS AIR CONDITIONING AND LOTS OF FOOD -- SAID THAT THE FMLN HAS SEIZED POSITIONS, WHICH IS NOT TRUE. ALL TOWNS IN THE COUNTRY ARE UNDER THE GOVERNMENT'S POLITICAL CONTROL AND UNDER THE ARMED FORCES' MILITARY CONTROL. WE MUST INFORM YOU THAT THERE ARE ONLY A FEW AREAS WHERE TERRORISTS HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE IN HOUSES AND ARE ACTING AS SNIPERS. HOWEVER, THE ARMED FORCES ARE TRYING TO DISLODGE THEM IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER IN ORDER NOT TO HARM CIVILIANS. THE COWARDS ARE HIDING IN A FEW AREAS. WE MUST TELL YOU THAT THE AREAS WHERE THERE IS SOME RESISTANCE ARE ILOPANGO, COLONIA SANTA LUCIA, SOYAPANGO, MEJICANOS, ZACAMIL, AYUTUXTEPEQUE, AND CIUDAD DELGADO. SALVADORANS WHO ARE IN THOSE AREAS, VICTIMS OF THE TERRORISTS: FROM HERE YOUR SALVADORAN BROTHERS, YOUR BROTHERS IN THE ARMED FORCES, TELL YOU THAT WE ARE AT YOUR SIDE AT THIS TIME OF STRUGGLE, DURING THIS SAD TIME WHEN YOU ARE FACED WITH HUNGER AND DEATH THREATS BY THE FMLN TERRORIST HORDES. WE ARE AT YOUR SIDE, COMPATRIOT! WE ARE WITH YOU SALVADORAN PEOPLE! YOUR ARMED FORCES WILL NOT ABANDON YOU. YOU CAN BE SURE THAT ALL THIS WILL SOON BE OVER. WE WILL SOON DISLODGE THESE MANGY DOGS WHO HAVE COME WITH ORTEGA'S WEAPONS AND TERRORIST HORDES, WHO HAVE COME HERE TO MASSACRE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. WE ARE WITH YOU COMPATRIOT! STAY WHERE YOU ARE. REMAIN CALM, AS YOU WILL SOON BE FREED FROM THE TERRORIST HORDES. ILOPANGO, COLONIA SANTA LUCIA, SOYAPANGO, MEJICANOS, ZACAMIL, AYUTUXTEPEQUE, AND CIUDAD DELGADO: REMEMBER THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT AND CRISTIANI ARE AT THE HEAD OF THE ARMED FORCES, AND THAT YOUR ARMED FORCES ARE UNITEDLY, PROFESSIONALLY, AND PATRIOTICALLY STRUGGLING TO DEFEND YOU FROM THIS BRUTAL AND BESTIAL ATTACK THAT WE DENOUNCE BEFORE THE WORLD. WHY IS IT THAT NO ONE SAYS ANYTHING? WHY DO JOURNALISTS IN EUROPE SAY NOTHING ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING? WHY DO THEY NOT TELL THE TRUTH? THEY ONLY REPEAT THE LIES OF RADIO VENCEREMOS AND THE LIAR RADIO FARABUNDO MARTI. THE PEOPLE'S TRUTH IS HERE. HERE IS THE TRUTH OF OUR PEOPLE, WHO HAVE ENDURED THE TERRORIST ATTACKS FOR 10 YEARS! SALVADORAN PEOPLE: BE BRAVE AND UNITED, FULL OF PATRIOTISM, AND SURE OF OUR VICTORY. OUR FATHERLAND IS FREE! OUR ARMED FORCES ARE GLORIOUSLY FIGHTING! FORWARD, ARMED FORCES! FORWARD, SALVADORAN PEOPLE!
DEV-MUC3-0741	CLANDESTINE, 14 NOV 89 -- ATTENTION, THIS IS A LAST-MINUTE REPORT FROM SAN SALVADOR: OUR FORCES HAVE OCCUPIED POSITIONS HELD BY THE NATIONAL POLICE IN CUSCATANCINGO. THE POLICEMEN WERE FORCED TO FLEE IN DISARRARY FROM A POSITION THAT THEY HAD HELD IN CUSCATANCINGO, NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR. MEANWHILE, THE ENEMY IS USING M-79 ROCKET LAUNCHERS IN DOWNTOWN MEJICANOS. THE MARKET AREA AND THE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED. WE REPEAT: A NATIONAL POLICE POSITION WAS ATTACKED BETWEEN 1310 AND 1350 . THE POLICEMEN, WHO ARE EXCELLENT AT REPRESSING THE PEOPLE AND THE COMMITTEES OF MOTHERS, FLED CUSCATANCINGO IN DISARRAY AFTER BEING ATTACKED BY FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT FORCES. AT 1407 , AN A-37 DRAGONFLY PLANE OVERFLEW AYUTUXTEPEQUE, MEJICANOS, AND ZACAMIL. OUR FIGHTERS ARE TRAINED TO FIRE AT THESE PLANES. THIRTY MINUTES AGO, A PUSH-AND-PULL 0-2 PLANE DROPPED BOMBS ON ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD AND A C-47 MACHINEGUNNED THE AREA. AN A-37 PLANE IS NOW OVERFLYING NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR AFTER OUR COMRADES OCCUPIED A POSITION THAT THE NATIONAL POLICE HAD HELD IN CUSCATANCINGO.
DEV-MUC3-0742	SAN SALVADOR, 14 NOV 89 -- POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC SOURCES TODAY REVEALED THAT THE GUERRILLAS TRIED TO KIDNAP SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND OTHER OFFICIALS OF THE RIGHT-WING GOVERNMENT ON 11 NOVEMBER WHEN THEY LAUNCHED THE LARGEST MILITARY OFFENSIVE OF THE PAST 10 YEARS. A NEIGHBOR OF THE PRESIDENT IN THE LUXURIOUS RESIDENTIAL AREA OF "MAQUILISHUAT," IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, SAID THAT "THE GUERRILLAS MANAGED TO ENTER PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S HOME, BUT COULD NOT KIDNAP HIM BECAUSE HE WAS NOT THERE." LEADERS OF THE RULING NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE HAVE CONFIRMED THAT GUERRILLAS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT HAD PLANNED TO KIDNAP PRESIDENT CRISTIANI "BUT WE DO NOT KNOW FOR WHAT PURPOSE." A RANKING OFFICIAL TOLD ACAN - EFE THAT "WE HAVE AGREED THAT IN THE EVENT OF A KIDNAPPING THERE WOULD BE NO RESCUE." "EVER SINCE WE WERE INSTALLED IN GOVERNMENT WE KNEW THAT WE COULD END UP ON THE FLOOR ," SAID AN OFFICIAL WHO ASKED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS. DIPLOMATIC CIRCLES ARE ALSO COMMENTING ON REPORTS REGARDING THE KIDNAPPING OF CRISTIANI AND TOP GOVERNMENT LEADERS. THEY CONFIRMED TO ACAN - EFE THAT THE GUERRILLAS WHO ATTACKED CRISTIANI'S RESIDENCE WERE WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS. SOME SOURCES MAINTAIN THAT THE DISGUISED GUERRILLAS SUBDUED PRESIDENTIAL RESIDENCE GUARDS AND ENTERED CRISTIANI'S HOME, BUT NEITHER THE PRESIDENT NOR ANY OF HIS RELATIVES WERE THERE. SOURCES CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT ASSURE THAT CRISTIANI, HIS WIFE MARGARITA, AND OTHER RELATIVES WERE AT A COUNTRYSIDE HOME IN "COATEPEQUE LAKE," HOWEVER, THIS CLAIM COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED. MOST MINISTERS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WERE RESTING AT COUNTRYSIDE HOMES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, BUT CONGRESS PRESIDENT RICARDO VALDIVIESO AND VICE PRESIDENT ROBERTO ANGULO WERE IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HOMES WHEN THE GUERRILLAS ATTACKED AND BOTH OF THEM FOUGHT BACK WITH THEIR WEAPONS. THE FMLN ON 11 NOVEMBER BEGAN A LARGE-SCALE MILITARY OFFENSIVE WHICH INCLUDED ATTACKS AT MORE THAN 50 POINTS NATIONWIDE, ESPECIALLY ARMY POSITIONS. THESE ATTACKS HAVE YIELDED ABOUT 1,000 CASUALTIES AMONG CIVILIANS, REBELS, AND SOLDIERS. SOME SOURCES CLAIM THAT THE RESIDENCE OF JULIO ADOLFO REY PRENDES, LEADER OF THE AUTHENTIC CHRISTIAN MOVEMENT , WAS ALSO ATTACKED BY THE GUERRILLAS, BUT THIS REPORT HAS NOT YET BEEN CONFIRMED. FIERCE FIGHTING BETWEEN THE ARMY AND GUERRILLAS, ESPECIALLY IN DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS IN NORTHEAST SAN SALVADOR, WHERE THE REBELS ARE ENTRENCHED, CONTINUES THREE DAYS AFTER THE OFFENSIVE BEGAN. COMMANDER JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, ONE OF THE FIVE TOP FMLN LEADERS, ANNOUNCED THAT 7 OF THE COUNTRY'S 14 DEPARTMENTS WERE DECLARED "FREED ZONES." THE REBELS MAINTAIN THAT THE OFFENSIVE IS DESIGNED TO BRING THE GOVERNMENT AND FMLN "TO AN EQUAL FOOTING" IN SEEKING A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE WAR CONFLICT. A GUERRILLA WHO WAS INTERVIEWED BY ACAN - EFE IN A SAN SALVADOR NEIGHBORHOOD SAID THAT "THE OFFENSIVE AIMS TO TOPPLE PRESIDENT CRISTIANI AND DESTROY THE FASCIST REPRESSIVE PLAN." SOME DIPLOMATS MAINTAIN THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND ARMY HAD BEEN EXPECTING THIS OFFENSIVE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, BUT UNDERESTIMATED IT, BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT THERE WOULD BE TWO OR THREE VIOLENT OUTBREAKS AND NOT A NATIONWIDE LARGE-SCALE OFFENSIVE SUCH AS THE ONE THAT BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER. "WE CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW THE GUERRILLAS MANAGED TO REACH CRISTIANI'S RESIDENCE," A SOURCE SAID.
DEV-MUC3-0743	SAN SALVADOR, 14 NOV 89 -- SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI DENIED THIS AFTERNOON THAT THE GUERRILLAS HAVE "LIBERATED TERRITORIES" IN THE COUNTRY, AS WAS ANNOUNCED BY THE CLANDESTINE "RADIO VENCEREMOS." HE ALSO DENIED THE REPORT THAT THE ARMY IS BOMBING CIVILIAN TOWNSHIPS. CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED AT A NEWS CONFERENCE THAT THERE IS "A TRIANGLE" CONSISTING OF PANAMANIAN GENERAL MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA, NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERSATION FRONT INVOLVED IN THE REBEL OFFENSIVE, BUT SAID HE COULD NOT SUPPLY ANY MORE DETAILS. THE PRESIDENT STATED THAT THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR IS CONTROLLED, BUT ADMITTED THAT THERE ARE STILL REBEL "REDOUBTS" IN DENSELY POPULATED ZONES. ACCORDING TO CRISTIANI, WHO HELD HIS FIRST NEWS CONFERENCE SINCE THE OFFENSIVE BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER, THE ARMED FORCES ARE ADVANCING SLOWLY BUT SURELY "SO AS NOT TO AFFECT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION."
DEV-MUC3-0744	CLANDESTINE, 14 NOV 89 -- U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH HYPOCRITICALLY REGRETTED TODAY THAT THE FMLN HAS TURNED THE REGION'S PEACE AGREEMENTS INTO A SENSELESS BLOODBATH WITH THE OFFENSIVE IT LAUNCHED ON 11 NOVEMBER. WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT THIS? I WOULD SAY THAT PRESIDENT BUSH'S REMARKS ARE VERY CYNICAL. HE SAID THAT A POLITICAL SOLUTION WAS BEING SOUGHT IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND WITH THIS ACTION, WE HAD BROKEN THE POLITICAL PATH AND SOUGHT OTHER OPTIONS. I THINK THE PEOPLE WHO BROKE THE PATH ARE THE UNITED STATES. WE MUST RECALL THAT WHILE WE WERE HOLDING TALKS IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA AND DEMANDING THE REMOVAL OF LA TANDONA AND DEMANDING JUSTICE AGAINST THE DEATH SQUADS IN ORDER TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION AND PARTICIPATE IN ELECTIONS, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT APPROVED MORE AID FOR THE FASCIST SECTORS, THE VERY SECTORS THAT WERE IN FACT REPRESSING THE PEOPLE AND CARRYING OUT SUCH DRAMATIC AND HORRIBLE ACTIONS AS THE ONE PERPETRATED AGAINST THE FENASTRAS BUILDING. THESE ACTIONS CONTINUE AND HAVE BEEN REPEATED EVERY DAY IN EL SALVADOR. THEREFORE, THE FIRST ONES TO BURY THE POLITICAL POSSIBILITY WERE THE UNITED STATES. THE FIRST ONES TO GIVE WEAPONS TO THE FASCISTS TO CONTINUE KILLING PEOPLE WERE THE UNITED STATES. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE CANNOT WAIT FOR THE FASCISTS TO KILL THEM ALL. THAT IS NO WAY TO ATTAIN PEACE, MUCH LESS DEMOCRACY IN EL SALVADOR. THAT IS WHAT THE UNITED STATES DID. RIGHT NOW WHEN WE ARE INVOLVED IN AN OFFENSIVE, WHO ARE THE ONES GUILTY OF GENOCIDE AGAINST THE PEOPLE? THE UNITED STATES. THOSE BOMBS AND THOSE ROCKETS THAT ARE FALLING ON CIVILIANS ARE BOMBS AND ROCKETS PROVIDED BY THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION TO THE SALVADORAN ARMY. THE ONES WHO HAVE BLOCKED THE POSSIBILITY OF PEACE AND NEGOTIATION IN EL SALVADOR ARE THE UNITED STATES. WE WANTED TO REMOVE LA TANDONA AND THE GOVERNMENT'S DEATH SQUADS THROUGH POLITICAL MEANS BUT THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. SO, WE ARE DOING IT THROUGH THE COMBAT OF OUR FORCES AND WITH THE COOPERATION OF ALL THE PEOPLE.
DEV-MUC3-0745	MANAGUA, 14 NOV -- A LEADER OF THE INSURRECTIONAL MOVEMENT IN EL SALVADOR TODAY SAID IN MANAGUA THAT THE MILITARY CAMPAIGN THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS HAVE LAUNCHED AGAINST ARMY TROOPS ON VARIOUS FRONTS AIMS TO CREATE THE APPROPRIATE CONDITIONS FOR A "GENUINE DIALOGUE" WITH GUARANTEES FOR THE PEOPLE. COMMANDER MARIO LOPEZ, MEMBER OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S POLITICAL COMMISSION, SAID THAT THE REBELS HAVE ORDERS TO "ADVANCE" AND CONTROL THE "FREED ZONES" AS PART OF ITS STRUGGLE AGAINST THE ARMY OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S "FASCIST GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS MAINTAINING A SOCIALLY UNJUST REGIME. LOPEZ, WHO IS ALSO KNOWN AS "COMMANDER VENANCIO SALVATIERRA," SAID THAT THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HAS USED MORE THAN 15 AIRCRAFTS TO BOMB CIVILIANS IN SOYAPANGO, ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR, AND NEIGHBORHOODS IN SAN MIGUEL, CAUSING SERIOUS STRUCTURAL DAMAGE AND KILLING CIVILIANS. THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA LEADER POINTED OUT THAT THE FMLN MILITARY CAMPAIGN, WHICH BEGAN WITH NATIONWIDE ATTACKS ON 11 NOVEMBER, HAS ENJOYED "POPULAR SUPPORT" WHICH MAKES IT "AN INSURRECTION WHOSE SCOPE IS DIFFICULT TO GAUGE." HE ADDED THAT THIS REACTION MEANS THAT THE FMLN "CANNOT ALLOW BLOWS AGAINST THE PEOPLE TO TAKE PLACE WITH IMPUNITY." "WE ARE SEEKING A CHANGE IN THE CORRELATION OF FORCES THAT WOULD BRING ABOUT APPROPRIATE CONDITIONS FOR A GENUINE DIALOGUE," MARIO LOPEZ POINTED OUT. HE ADDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI MUST "QUIT HOPING FOR A MILITARY VICTORY OVER THE FMLN." AS FOR EFFORTS TO BRING ABOUT A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT, LOPEZ SAID THAT EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE BY VARIOUS GOVERNMENTS TO PREVENT THE GENOCIDAL ACTIONS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY. HE SAID THAT THE FMLN IS MAKING SUCH EFFORTS AT THE UNITED NATIONS AND OAS WHERE NICARAGUA HAS PROPOSED A RESUMPTION OF NEGOTIATIONS. HE ADDED THAT FOR THE TIME BEING, THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS ARE ORGANIZING "POPULAR GOVERNMENTS" IN THE "FREED ZONES," HOWEVER, HE SAID NOTHING ABOUT THE ETABLISHMENT OF A PROVISIONAL FMLN GOVERNMENT. LOPEZ SAID THAT AN INTERVENTION BY THE GUATEMALAN ARMY IN THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT, BY SUPPORTING THE CRISTIANI ARMY, "WOULD BE DANGEROUS FOR CENTRAL AMERICA BECAUSE THE CONFLICT COULD BE SPREADED." HE RECALLED THAT GUATEMALA IS FACING A GUERRILLA STRUGGLE WHICH IS OLDER THAN THE ONE IN EL SALVADOR. LOPEZ DENIED THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS EXIST BECAUSE OF THE USSR, CUBA, AND NICARAGUA AND ADDED THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA STRUGGLE IS OLDER THAN THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT ITSELF . HE ADDED THAT THE FMLN HAS DEVELOPED ITS OWN STRATEGIES AND EVEN ITS OWN WEAPONS, HOWEVER, HE ADMITTED THAT IT RECEIVES WEAPONS FROM ABROAD. HE PROVIDED NO FUTHER DETAILS ON THE FMLN'S "OWN" WEAPONS.
DEV-MUC3-0746	SAN SALVADOR, 14 NOV 89 -- SALVADORAN DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL HUMBERTO LARIOS DECLARED TODAY THAT BETWEEN 1,000 AND 1,500 FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GUERRILLAS HAVE BEEN FIGHTING IN THE CAPITAL SINCE LAST SATURDAY. THE DEFENSE MINISTER DENIED THAT THE ARMY IS BOMBING CIVILIAN AREAS, AS THE GUERRILLAS CHARGED TODAY. LARIOS ADMITTED THAT THE REBELS HAVE HIT "FOUR OR FIVE HELICOPTERS" AND SEVERAL ARMY RADIO PATROL VEHICLES BUT ADDED THAT THEY HAVE NOT DESTROYED ANY ARMORED VEHICLES. THE MILITARY LEADER SAID THAT THE ARMY IS NOT DROPPING HEAVY BOMBS ON THE TOWNSHIPS IN WHICH GUERRILLAS HAVE TAKEN REFUGE IN ORDER TO "PROTECT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION." PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI DENIED THAT THE GUERRILLAS HAVE "LIBERATED TERRITORIES," AS THE FMLN ANNOUNCED TODAY.
DEV-MUC3-0747	CLANDESTINE, 14 NOV 89 -- THE ARMY FAILED TODAY IN ITS ATTEMPT TO RECOVER THE POSITIONS TAKEN OVER BY OUR FORCES ON 11 NOVEMBER IN THE COUNTRY'S MAIN CITIES. THE ENEMY'S COUNTEROFFENSIVE RESULTED IN MORE BLOODSHED AMONG ITS RANKS. THE ARMY SOWED TERROR AND DEATH AMONG THE CIVILIAN POPULATION BY CARRYING OUT INDISCRIMINATE MACHINEGUNNING AND BOMBINGS AGAINST DENSELY POPULATED AREAS IN APOPA, THE HERMITA AND OBRERA NEIGHBORHOODS, THE CEMETERY AREA, THE SANTA ELENA NEIGHBORHOOD, THE OUTSKIRTS OF USULUTAN, LA ESMERALDA NEIGHBORHOOD, LA COQUERA AND EL GRANILLO IN SAN MIGUEL, THE NORTHERN MAIN HIGHWAY, ZACATECOLUCA, SOYAPANGO, AYUTUXTEPEQUE, AND ZACAMIL. IN MANY OF THESE PLACES, THE AIR RAIDS LASTED PRACTICALLY ALL DAY, PRODUCING NUMEROUS CASUALTIES AMONG MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN, AND DESTROYING MANY HOUSES AND OTHER BUILDINGS. IN OVERCOMING THE ARMY'S COUNTEROFFENSIVE, WE HAVE MAINTAINED ABSOLUTE CONTROL OF ALL OUR POSITIONS IN THE VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE INFLICTED THE FOLLOWING CUMULATIVE DAMAGE TO THE ENEMY: APPROXIMATELY 760 CASUALTIES, 24 ARMORED VEHICLES OUT OF COMBAT, AS WELL AS 11 HELICOPTERS AND PLANES. SUPPORT FOR THE TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE HAS BEEN TOTAL IN ALMOST ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. ONLY 24 HOURS AFTER SUMMONING THE PEOPLE FOR A GENERAL REBELLION, PEOPLE HAVE MASSIVELY JOINED IN THE TASKS OF COLLABORATION AND SUPPORT OR HAVE DIRECTLY PARTICIPATED IN COMBAT. THE DECREE DECLARING A 24-HOUR CURFEW IN THE NORTHERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR SHOWS THAT WHAT THE ARMY IS FACING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IS NOT THE FMLN BUT THE PEOPLE'S GROWING REBELLION. OUR HEROIC FIGHTERS HAVE RESPONDED WITH THE USUAL VIGOR AND EFFICIENCY TO THE ORDER GIVEN BY OUR GENERAL COMMAND TO HOLD THE POSITIONS CONQUERED AND IMMEDIATELY ORGANIZE THE PEOPLE'S GENERAL UPRISING. OUT WITH THE FASCISTS; FEBE ELIZABETH LIVES! FMLN GENERAL COMMAND COMMANDERS SALVADOR SANCHEZ SEREN, FRANCISCO JOVEL, EDUARDO SANCHO, SHAFIK JORGE HANDAL, AND JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS EL SALVADOR, 14 NOVEMBER 1989
DEV-MUC3-0748	SAN SALVADOR, 14 NOV 89 -- OFFICIALS REPORTED THAT 220 TERRORISTS HAVE BEEN KILLED, 196 WOUNDED, AND 22 CAPTURED DURING THE CLASHES THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE AREA OF THE UNIVERSITY AND ITS OUTSKIRTS. AMONG THE WAR MATERIEL CONFISCATED: A SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE, 140 HIGH-CALIBER RIFLES, 6 LAW ROCKET LAUNCHERS, AND MACHINEGUNS. AN ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE COPREFA SPOKESMAN STATED THAT THEY WERE NOT AUTHORIZED TO RELEASE ANY OFFICIAL INFORMATION ON THE 11, 12, AND 13 NOVEMBER EVENTS. MILITARY SOURCES WHO WERE QUESTIONED STATED THAT ACCORDING TO INITIAL REPORTS--REPORTS WHICH ARE UNOFFICIAL AND COVER ONLY UP TO THE AFTERNOON OF 13 NOVEMBER--RECEIVED FROM SOLDIERS WHO FOUGHT AGAINST THE EXTREMISTS POSITIONED AT THE EL SALVADOR UNIVERSITY, THE TERRORISTS SUFFERED MORE THAN 400 CASUALTIES. THESE CASUALTIES WERE DISTRIBUTED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER: 220 KILLED, 196 WOUNDED, AND 22 CAPTURED. THE CONFISCATED WAR MATERIEL INCLUDED A SOVIET-MADE SURFACE-TO- AIR MISSILE--CONSIDERED THE MOST IMPORTANT CATCH; 140 HIGH-CALIBER RIFLES INCLUDING 74 AK-47 ASSAULT RIFLES, LAW ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 2 M- 79 GRENADE LAUNCHERS, 3 UZI MACHINEGUNS, 50 GRENADES, 2 DRAGUNOV RIFLES FOR SNIPERS, AND 38 BLASTING CAPS, APPROXIMATELY 1000 M-16 CARTRIDGES; AND 136 AK-47 CARTRIDGES. ALSO CONFISCATED WERE FOUR KNAPSACKS CONTAINING CLOTHING AND COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA, FIVE TNT BLOCKS, TWO OLIVE-GREEN UNIFORMS, AND MATERIAL TO MANUFACTURE EXPLOSIVES. OFFICIALS REPORTED THAT THE CONFISCATED SOVIET MISSILE WAS PART OF A 15-MISSILE LOT THAT ENTERED SALVADORAN TERRITORY FROM NICARAGUA AND THAT HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN STORED IN PERQUIN, MORAZAN DEPARTMENT. THE SOURCE ADDED THAT IT WAS A VERY SOPHISTICATED WEAPON AND THAT ITS PRESENCE IN SALVADORAN TERRITORY CONFIRMS THAT ONCE AGAIN THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT HAS SUPPLIED WEAPONS TO THE FMLN . THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO SUPPLY WEAPONS DESPITE THE PROMISE MADE BY PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA AT TELA, HONDURAS THAT HIS REGIME WOULD NO LONGER SUPPLY WEAPONS TO THE SALVADORAN TERRORIST GROUPS.
DEV-MUC3-0749	SAN SALVADOR, 14 NOV 89 -- GOOD EVENING, SALVADORAN PEOPLE--IF I MAY SAY, SO DESPITE THE CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECTING THE CAPITAL CITY. IT IS REGRETTABLE AND INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT SHOULD PERSIST WITH THE AGGRESSION IT HAS UNLEASHED AGAINST OUR CAPITAL CITY AND SURROUNDING MUNICIPALITIES. OUR POPULATION HAS SUFFERED THE MOST FROM THIS FMLN AGGRESSION. THIS AGGRESSION, SALVADORAN FRIENDS, MUST BE SEEN AS AN ACT OF DESPERATION BY THE FMLN, AS THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN EXPLAIN THEIR IRRATIONAL ACTIONS. I HAVE USED THE WORD DESPERATION BECAUSE THE FMLN KNOWS THAT IT IS OUT OF STYLE AND THAT ITS ATTITUDES ARE NO LONGER ACCEPTED IN THE WORLD. WE CAN SEE IN EUROPE THAT COUNTRIES HAVE PASSED FROM TOTALITARIAN REGIMES SUCH AS THE ONE THAT THE FMLN WANTS TO IMPLEMENT HERE, AND WALLS ARE OPEN FOR LIBERTY AND DEMOCRACY. WE ARE SURE THAT THIS IS WHAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WANT: LIBERTY AND DEMOCRACY. THAT IS WHY THEY HAVE NOT SUPPORTED AND WILL NEVER SUPPORT THE FMLN TERRORISTS WHO WANT TO SUBJECT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO TOTALITARIAN REGIMES, TO DICTATORSHIPS OF OPPRESSION, REPRESSION, AND VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. I WAS SAYING THAT THIS IS A DESPERATE ACT BECAUSE WE CANNOT SEE HOW ANYONE WHO IS NOT DESPERATE COULD CAUSE SO MUCH HARM TO INNOCENT PEOPLE AND TO THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. THERE ARE ALREADY MORE THAN 100 DEAD OR WOUNDED BECAUSE OF THE FMLN'S IRRATIONAL ACTIONS. OF COURSE, TO THAT WE MUST ADD THAT THEY DESTROYED MANY HOMES WHICH THEY ENTERED AND HAVE HELD FAMILIES AS HOSTAGES. THEY HAVE DAMAGED THE ELECTRICITY, POTABLE WATER, AND TELEPHONE SYSTEMS, DEPRIVING THE POPULATION OF THOSE ESSENTIAL SERVICES, NOT TO MENTION THE LACK OF FOOD AFFECTING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN THE AREAS WHERE THEY ARE HOLDING HOSTAGES. IN ADDITION, IT IS APPROPRIATE TO SEE HOW FAR THE FMLN TERRORISTS' IRRATIONAL MINDS CAN GO, BECAUSE THEY HAVE CARRIED OUT ACTS OF SAVAGERY THAT WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND. HOW CAN THERE STILL BE ANYONE LIKE THE NICARAGUANS--AND I AM TALKING ABOUT THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT, OF COURSE, NOT ALL NICARAGUANS--AND THE CUBANS, WHO SUPPORT SUCH ACTS OF SAVAGERY. HOLDING CIVILIANS AS HOSTAGES, PUTTING THEM IN THE MIDDLE SO THAT THEY WILL BE THE ONES WHO ARE HURT, AND SHIELDING THEMSELVES BEHIND INNOCENT PEOPLE IS AN ACT OF SAVAGERY, SALVADORAN PEOPLE. TAKING OVER A CENTER FOR ORPHAN CHILDREN IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEMSELVES BEHIND LITTLE CHILDREN WHO DO NOT HAVE A FATHER OR A MOTHER IS AN ACT OF SAVAGERY, SALVADORAN PEOPLE. THEY EVEN DID SOMETHING WORSE AT THE ZACATECOLUCA HOSPITAL AND THE PEOPLE WITNESSED THIS. WHEN THEY ENTERED THE HOSPITAL IN ZACATECOLUCA, THEY MURDERED, AT GUNPOINT, A SOLDIER WHO WAS RECEIVING MEDICAL ATTENTION; THEY PLACED BOMBS INSIDE THE HOSPITAL AND THEN FLED. SALVADORAN PEOPLE: THE FMLN IS ALREADY A DESPERATE BEAST. THIS IS THE ONLY THING WE CAN SAY ABOUT SUCH IRRATIONAL MINDS. HOWEVER, WE MUST REALIZE AND UNDERSTAND, AND ABOVE ALL, BE SURE THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR PEOPLE REPUDIATE THE FMLN TERRORISTS. THE PEOPLE MUST KNOW THAT THEY CAN COUNT ON THEIR ARMED FORCES WHICH HAVE ADVANCED SLOWLY, BUT SURELY. IT IS ADVANCING SLOWLY BECAUSE IT WANTS TO FULLY PROTECT THE LIVES OF CIVILIANS. THE ARMED FORCES COULD DRIVE THOSE TERRORISTS OUT OF WHERE THEY ARE; HOWEVER, THERE ARE CIVILIANS THERE, AND WE WOULD NEVER WANT TO EXPOSE THOSE CIVILIANS TO THE DANGER THE FMLN IS TRYING TO LEAD THEM INTO. THE ARMED FORCES HAVE CONTINUED TO ADVANCE. THEY HAVE EFFECTIVELY ADVANCED, USING PROFESSIONAL MEANS. FOR EXAMPLE, NEIGHBORHOODS SUCH AS BOSQUES DEL RIO ARE TOTALLY CALM NOW, BECAUSE THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ALREADY ENTERED AND FORCED THE TERRORISTS OUT. WE KNOW THAT ALL OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN END TO THIS TERROR THAT THE FMLN WANTS TO CREATE. HOWEVER, WE MUST ALSO UNDERSTAND, PARTICULARLY THOSE OF US WHO ARE NOT AS ANGUISHED AT THIS MOMENT AS THOSE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BECOME FMLN HOSTAGES. THEY TOO, DESERVE THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ACHIEVE OUR OBJECTIVE; HOWEVER, WE MUST DO SO RESPECTING THE LIVES OF THOSE INNOCENT PEOPLE. THE FMLN FAILED TO ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVE.
DEV-MUC3-0750	HAVANA , 15 NOV 89 -- COMMANDER IN CHIEF FIDEL CASTRO RUZ, FIRST SECRETARY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CUBA AND PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCILS OF STATE AND MINISTERS, LAST NIGHT GRANTED AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW TO OUR REPORTER, OSCAR SUAREZ, AT THE INAUGURATION OF THE MADRID RESTAURANT IN HABANA VIEJA. TODAY IS AN IMPORTANT DAY. TODAY, WHEN WE ARE COMMEMORATING THE 470TH ANNIVERSARY OF HAVANA, WE RECEIVED THE NEWS OF THE CRUSHING TRIUMPH OF THE SOUTH-WEST AFRICAN PEOPLE'S ORGANIZATION IN THE NAMIBIAN ELECTIONS BY 57 PERCENT. IT IS A VERY GOOD PERCENTAGE. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE ALSO RECEIVED THE NEWS.... WE ADMIRE THE HEROISM WITH WHICH THE SALVADORANS ARE FIGHTING. IT IS SOMETHING VERY IMPRESSIVE. IT IS A LIKE A LESSON TO IMPERIALISM WHICH IS EUPHORIC AND THINKS THAT THE WORLD IS AT ITS FEET. THEY THINK THAT... WHICH IS TERRIBLE. I BELIEVE THE ACTIONS THAT THE SALVADORANS ARE PRESENTLY CARRYING OUT ARE ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY FEATS THAT HAVE EVER BEEN WRITTEN. DESPITE THE 10 YEARS , THE BILLIONS THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS INVESTED IN CREATING THE SALVADORAN ARMY AND SUPPLYING IT WITH THE MOST MODERN TYPES OF ARMS, NOTICE HOW THOSE PEOPLE CAN FIGHT. NOTICE WHAT IS BEING DONE. HOW ARE THEY USING THE YANKEE BOMBS AND PLANES? THEY ARE BEING USED TO MASSACRE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. JUST NOTICE HOW THEY ARE INDISCRIMINATELY BOMBING THE PEOPLE'S NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH ARE IN THE HANDS OF THE REVOLUTIONARIES. WHAT THE IMPERIALISTS ARE DOING IS SOMETHING REPUGNANT. HOWEVER, I THINK THAT WHAT THE SALVADORANS ARE DOING IS AMAZING, ADMIRABLE. WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS SHOWING THE IMPERIALISTS THAT THE PEOPLE ARE FAR FROM KNEELING BEFORE THEM. THEIR ACTIONS ARE SHOWING IMPERIALISM THAT THE PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE FIGHTING WITHOUT CARING ABOUT THE EUPHORIA THAT CURRENTLY OVERCOMES THEM UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. COMMANDER, WHAT ELSE CAN YOU SAY ON THE SUBJECT OF WHY WE HAVE SO MANY FRIENDS? WE, THE CUBANS ARE WHAT WE ARE BECAUSE WE ARE A MIXTURE OF SPANISH AND AFRICAN. I THINK WE HAVE THE FRIENDS WE DO BECAUSE WE HAVE FOLLOWED A POLICY OF PRINCIPLE. I THINK THE FRIENDS WE HAVE ARE BASICALLY DUE TO THE PRESTIGE OF THE REVOLUTION, THE RESPECT THE REVOLUTION MERITS, THE ETHICS OF THE REVOLUTION, AND THE PRINCIPLES OF THE REVOLUTION. NOW, THE FACT THAT WE ARE ALSO A MIXTURE OF CARIBBEANS, THAT IS SOMETHING ELSE. THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS. REASONS WE CAN HAVE CONGENIALITY. HOWEVER, CONGENIALITY DOES NOT ALWAYS TURN INTO TRUE FRIENDSHIP. THERE COULD BE CONGENIALITY BUT IT DOES NOT RESULT IN FRIENDSHIP. FRIENDSHIP IS MORE A RESULT OF RECOGNITION, ADMIRATION FOR A COUNTRY. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT... THIS SMALL COUNTRY WAS FACING THE EMPIRE, IT BECAME A BASTION OF DIGNITY FOR THE WORLD. I THINK THIS MERITS CERTAIN RECOGNITION AND LIKING. WE CAN BE PROUD OF THAT AND OF THE FRIENDS WE HAVE. I APPRECIATE THESE FRIENDS WHO ARE FRIENDS OF CUBA DESPITE YANKEE PRESSURES. THEY ARE FRIENDS OF CUBA DESPITE YANKEE THREATS, INTRIGUES, AND CAMPAIGNS. THIS SAYS A LOT. THE YANKEES WANTED TO BURY AND DISCREDIT THE REVOLUTION WITH THE MEDIA AGENCIES THEY OWN. HOWEVER, THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT. THAT IS WHY UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE FRIENDSHIP AND SOLIDARITY THAT OTHER NATIONS RENDER US. ASIDE, FROM THAT, WE ARE CARIBBEANS. WE ARE A GOOD MIXTURE. WE ARE A MIXTURE OF WHICH WE ARE PROUD. WE ARE A MIXTURE OF INDIAN, AFRICAN, AND EUROPEAN. THAT MIXTURE HAS TURNED OUT TO BE VERY GOOD. WE ALSO HAVE CHINESE MIXTURE IN US. THAT IS TRUE, YOU ARE CORRECT IN REMINDING US OF IT. I THINK THIS MIXTURE HAS ALSO HELPED TO ENRICH THE VIRTUES OF OUR NATION.
DEV-MUC3-0751	MADRID , 15 NOV 89 -- LA PAZ, 15 NOV -- THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR 1 WEEK IN LA PAZ DUE TO DEMONSTRATIONS CARRIED OUT BY LABOR UNIONS HAS INCREASED DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS WITH STREET CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN POLICE AND DEMONSTRATORS AND WITH THE EXPLOSION OF 8 BOMBS. THE PROTESTS BEGAN APPROXIMMATELY 1 MONTH AGO IN SUPPORT OF THE ECONOMIC DEMANDS OF 74,000 TEACHERS, WHO ARE ASKING FOR A BONUS OF APPROXIMATELY $100, BUT THE VIOLENCE BECAME GENERAL WHEN THE GOVERNMENT REFUSED TO GRANT THE BONUS.
DEV-MUC3-0752	CLANDESTINE, 15 NOV 89 -- THIS IS A LAST-MINUTE REPORT. THE SORIANO BATTALION HAS BEEN ATTACKED NEAR THE ARENA HEADQUARTERS. AS A RESULT, SEVERAL WERE KILLED AND WOUNDED. IT HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED THAT THE ATLACATL BATTALION WAS REPELLED WEST OF DOLORES IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE THIS MORNING. THE BATTALION THEN WITHDREW. IN ADDITION, THE CUSCATANCINGO NATIONAL POLICE GARRISON IS UNDER SIEGE. WE REPEAT: OUR FORCES HAVE LAID SIEGE TO THE CUSCATANCINGO POLICE GARRISON. THE GUERRILLAS ARE ADVANCING. ACCORDING TO A REPORT, THE REBELS ARE HOLDING THEIR POSITIONS IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE AND CIUDAD DELGADO. NEW ROADBLOCKS WERE ERECTED THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. THE FRONTLINE HAS BEEN MOVING FORWARD CONSTANTLY. OUR FORCES HAVE BEEN INCREASING THE AREAS UNDER THEIR CONTROL IN SAN SALVADOR. THE ARMED FORCES ARE IN A TIGHT POSITION BECAUSE THE GUERRILLAS HAVE OCCUPIED THE SANTA TECLA - SAN SALVADOR HIGHWAY.
DEV-MUC3-0753	GUATEMALA CITY, 15 NOV 89 -- GUATEMALAN SECURITY FORCES LAST NIGHT DEFUSED A BOMB PLANTED IN FRONT OF THE SALVADORAN EMBASSY IN GUATEMALA CITY, THE POLICE REPORTED TODAY. THE POLICE ALSO REPORTED THAT TWO BOMBS EXPLODED LAST NIGHT AND DESTROYED TWO TELEPHONE JUNCTION BOXES IN SEPARATE LOCATIONS IN THE CAPITAL. THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES. THE EXPLOSIONS, HOWEVER, CAUSED GREAT ALARM AND PROMPTED SEVERAL POLICE PATROL CARS TO COMB THE AREAS IN SEARCH OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS, THE SOURCE ADDED. A SQUAD DEFUSED A HIGH - POWER BOMB THAT HAD BEEN PLANTED IN FRONT OF THE SALVADORAN EMBASSY. NO VICTIMS AT THE SITE OF THE EXPLOSIONS WERE REPORTED. THE DAMAGE ON THE JUNCTION BOXES, HOWEVER, WILL PROBABLY BE COSTLY TO THE STATE TELEPHONE ORGANIZATION. THESE ATTACKS ARE IN ADDITION TO THE ONE SUSTAINED BY THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE OPPOSITION RIGHTIST NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENT LAST WEEK. THE EXPLOSION DEMOLISHED MOST OF THE OFFICE. SO FAR, NO GROUP OR ORGANIZATION HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE TERRORIST ATTACKS.
DEV-MUC3-0754	SAN SALVADOR, 15 NOV 89 -- THE SALVADORAN ARMY TODAY ATTACKED BY LAND AND AIR THE GUERRILLAS WHO EARLY THIS MORNING OCCUPIED CIUDAD MERLIOT, A MIDDLE-CLASS RESIDENTIAL AREA IN SOUTHWESTERN SAN SALVADOR. AN "A-37" SALVADORAN AIR FORCE PLANE FLEW OVER THE AREA AND STRAFED CERTAIN POINTS, WHILE ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS WENT THROUGH THE STREETS AND INFANTRY SOLDIERS CONFRONTED THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GUERRILLAS. THE REBELS, WHO HAVE BEEN FIGHTING SINCE 11 NOVEMBER IN THE CAPITAL CITY, TOOK POSITIONS IN CIUDAD MERLIOT VERY EARLY THIS MORNING AND BURNED BUSES AND TRUCKS, AND THEN PLACED THE CHARRED VEHICLES AS BARRICADES ON THE MAIN ENTRANCES TO THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS. THE GUERRILLAS ALSO CUT OFF ACCESS TO THE MAIN HIGHWAY JOINING SAN SALVADOR TO SANTA ANA, THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT CITY IN THE COUNTRY, AND LA LIBERTAD PORT. AT LEAST FIVE ARMY ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS WERE CONTINUOUSLY FIRING ON THE GUERRILLA POSITIONS IN CIUDAD MERLIOT. "GET AWAY. THIS IS A PROHIBITED AREA. THERE IS HEAVY SHOOTING AGAINST THE GUERRILLAS," SHOUTED A SOLDIER FROM ONE OF THE ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS TO AN ACAN-EFE CORRESPONDENT WHO WAS MOMENTARILY TRAPPED ON ONE OF THE MAIN STREETS OF THE RESIDENTIAL AREA. THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS ON 11 NOVEMBER BEGAN THE GREATEST MILITARY OFFENSIVE OF THE LAST 10 YEARS, INFLICTING OVER 1,000 CASUALTIES, ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SOURCES.
DEV-MUC3-0755	CLANDESTINE, 15 NOV 89 -- "ATTENTION, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION. WE CALL ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS, THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS, BROTHER PEOPLES OF THE WORLD.

DEV-MUC3-0757	SAN SALVADOR, 16 NOV 89 -- THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HEREBY INFORM THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC PUBLIC OPINION THAT THEY EMPHATICALLY CONDEMN THE TREACHEROUS MURDER COMMITTED BY FMLN GUERRILLAS AGAINST DR IGNACIO ELLACURIA, RECTOR OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY, AS WELL AS OTHER UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS AT THIS CENTER OF HIGHER LEARNING. THE ARMED FORCES ALSO STRONGLY REJECT ANY REPORTS ON THIS MURDER THAT ATTEMPT TO INVOLVE THEM. THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES ARE RIGHT NOW BENT ON OBEYING THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATIONS OF PRESERVING SAFETY, DEFENDING THE COUNTRY'S SOVEREIGNTY, THE INTEGRITY OF ITS TERRITORY, AS WELL AS MAINTAINING THE COUNTRY'S PEACE, TRANQUILLITY, AND PUBLIC SECURITY. THE ARMED FORCES REITERATE TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT ALL THEIR MEN ARE SERVING THE COUNTRY TO SAFEGUARD THE PROPERTY AND LIVES AND STRICTLY UPHOLDING THE LAW WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS. WE ALSO MAKE A SPECIAL CALL TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO NOT BE TAKEN IN BY UNFOUNDED NEWS SPREAD BY THE FMLN MARXIST-LENINIST GUERILLAS, WITH WHICH THEY TRY TO HIDE THEIR FAILED ARMED ADVENTURE AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAVE PROFESSIONALLY REPELLED MOST OF THE INVADERS' REDOUBTS, THROUGH WHICH THE FMLN IS ATTEMPTING TO SEIZE POWER THROUGH A GENERALIZED MASSACRE AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. EL SALVADOR, 16 NOVEMBER 1989.
DEV-MUC3-0758	CLANDESTINE, 16 NOV 89 -- ATTENTION, ATTENTION, THE ARMED FORCES' COUNTERATTACK ON OUR POSITIONS IN ZACAMIL HAS FAILED. ATTENTION, AT THIS TIME RADIO VENCEREMOS PROCLAIMS THAT THE NEW ARMED FORCES' COUNTEROFFENSIVE TO ATTACK OUR POSITIONS IN ZACAMIL HAS FAILED. A REPORT SENT BY COMRADES COMMANDER CLAUDIO RABINDRANATH ARMIJO AND CARLOS ARGUETA INDICATE THAT THE ENEMY ATTEMPT TO TAKE OUR POSITIONS IN ZACAMIL FAILED. AT 0400 TODAY, AN IMPORTANT BATTLE WAS FOUGHT IN ZACAMIL. COMBINED TROOPS OF THE BELLOSO AND BRACAMONTE BATTALIONS, AND A CAVALRY UNIT, WITH THE SUPPORT OF ONE HELICOPTER AND ONE OR TWO LIGHT PLANES, TRIED TO ATTACK OUR FORTIFIED POSITIONS. HOWEVER, THIS ATTEMPT ENDED IN A RESOUNDING FAILURE. THE ENEMY SUSTAINED 45 CASUALTIES IN THE ATTACK, WHICH LASTED FROM 0400 UNTIL 1100. THESE CASUALTIES, WHICH HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED, INCLUDED A SECTION CHIEF. IN ADDITION, OUR FORCES DESTROYED ONE ARMORED VEHICLE AND DAMAGED ANOTHER. WE ALSO HAVE A BELLOSO BATTALION PATROL TRAPPED IN ONE OF THE BUILDINGS. SOME MEMBERS OF THIS PATROL WERE WOUNDED, OTHERS WERE KILLED IN ACTION. IN ITS DESPERATION, THE ARMY HAS USED THE AIR FORCE FOR ITS INDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS. THIS IS A LAST-MINUTE REPORT WE HAVE FROM SAN SALVADOR: THE ENEMY COUNTERATTACK FAILED IN ZACAMIL. BY NOON, OUR FORCES HAD HAD CONTROLLED THIS ATTACK. THE SITUATION IN SAN SALVADOR IS BECOMING MORE CRITICAL FOR THE GENERAL STAFF WITH THE FALL OF THE CUSCATANCINGO GARRISON, WHERE OUR FORCES SEIZED THOUSANDS OF ITEMS OF MILITARY SUPPLIES AND AMMUNITION.
DEV-MUC3-0759	SAN SALVADOR, 16 NOV -- A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS HAS DECLARED THAT THE CICR HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO ENTER THE AREAS AFFECTED BY LAST NIGHT'S FIERCE FIGHTING AND BOMBING "BECAUSE THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES FROM THE GOVERNMENT." MARIE AUDE LUDE, CICR SPOKESWOMAN IN EL SALVADOR TOLD ACAN - EFE THAT "WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY REPLY FROM THE AUTHORITIES REGARDING OUR REQUEST FOR A 6-HOUR TRUCE MADE ON 15 NOVEMBER."

THEY SAID THAT THE AIR FORCE CONTINUOUSLY MACHINEGUNNED GUERRILLA POSITIONS IN THE DENSLY POPULATED AREAS. THE CICR HAS ASKED THE TWO SIDES TO DECREE A 6-HOUR TRUCE TO EVACUATE THE WOUNDED AND BURY THE MANY BODIES THAT ARE SPREAD THROUGOUT THE CITY.

DEV-MUC3-0760	WASHINGTON DC , 16 NOV 89 -- SALVADORAN FOREIGN MINISTER JOSE MANUEL PACAS CASTRO TODAY CONDEMNED THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUITS AND TWO WOMEN IN HIS COUNTRY, AND HE BLAMED THE ULTRALEFTIST GROUPS FOR IT, ALTHOUGH HE SAID HE HAD NO PROOF. "IT IS A REPUGNANT CRIME," SAID THE FOREIGN MINISTER, WHO WAS ATTENDING THE 19TH OAS GENERAL ASSEMBLY, AND HE DESCRIBED THE ASSASSINATIONS AS A "DESPERATE ACTION TAKEN BY THE LEFT." JOAO BAENA SOARES, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE OAS, WAS ASKED TODAY TO REPORT TO THE ASSEMBLY ON THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE RESOLUTION ON THAT COUNTRY THAT WAS APPROVED ON TUESDAY. A COMMUNIQUE RELEASED TODAY BY A FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT SPOKESMAN IN WASHINGTON BLAMED THE SALVADORAN ARMY FOR THE CRIME, AND ADDED THAT "ALL OF THE BODIES HAD BULLET WOUNDS IN THE HEAD, INDICATING THAT THEY WERE EXECUTED." PACAS CASTRO SAID TODAY THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT, HEADED BY ALFREDO CRISTIANI, WILL MAINTAIN ITS COMMITMENT TO A DIALOGUE TO DISCUSS THE SUSPENSION OF THE HOSTILITIES AND TO IMPLEMENT AN INTERNAL PEACE PROCESS. MOREOVER, HE ANNOUNCED THAT AN OFFICIAL MISSION, CAPABLE OF MAKING DECISIONS AND COMMITMENTS, WILL TRAVEL TO CARACAS IN THE HOPE OF MEETING WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FMLN GUERRILLAS. THE SALVADORAN FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THE SITUATION IN HIS COUNTRY IS UNDER CONTROL AND THAT ARMY TROOPS ARE SLOWLY MOVING INTO THE DENSELY POPULATED AREAS TO AVOID BLOODSHED AMONG THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. AS FOR A REQUEST BY THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS TO CALL FOR A CEASE-FIRE FOR HUMANITARIAN REASONS TO TREAT THE WOUNDED AND CIVILIAN VICTIMS, PACAS CASTRO SAID THAT THE FIRST-AID BRIGADES CONTINUE TO DO THEIR WORK IN EL SALVADOR. AS FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF THE SIX JESUITS AND THE TWO WOMEN, HE SAID "HE CONDEMNED THIS TYPE OF VIOLENCE" BECAUSE IGNACIO ELLACURIA, ONE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS WHO WAS KILLED, "WAS MY TEACHER," AND HE DESCRIBED THE PRIEST AS A VERY VALUABLE MAN WHO WORKED FOR PEACE AND FOR THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE POPULATION. COSTA RICAN FOREIGN MINISTER RODRIGO MADRIGAL NIETO, IN STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS, REGRETTED THE DEATH OF THE CLERGYMEN. "WORKING FOR PEACE IS VERY DIFFICULT," HE SAID. MADRIGAL NIETO SAID TODAY HE HOPED THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS WOULD CONTINUE DESPITE THE WAR. GUATEMALAN FOREIGN MINISTER ARIEL RIVERA IRIAS SUPPORTED THE STATEMENTS OF HIS COSTA RICAN COLLEAGUE, AND HE CONDEMNED THE USE OF VIOLENCE AS A POLITICAL TOOL.
DEV-MUC3-0761	CLANDESTINE, 16 NOV 89 -- THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND REPORTS THE FOLLOWING TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY: 1. IT WAS LEARNED THROUGH MILITARY INTELLIGENCE SOURCES THAT THERE WERE DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN U.S. PENTAGON ADVISERS AND THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES' GENERAL STAFF ON THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF SALVADORAN AIR FORCE PILOTS. 2. AS A RESULT OF THESE ASSESSMENTS, ON 13 NOVEMBER, U.S. COMBAT PILOTS ARRIVED AT THE ILOPANGO AIR FORCE BASE FROM HONDURAS. 3. IN THE PAST 48 HOURS, THESE U.S. PILOTS HAVE BEEN CARRYING OUT THE BOMBING MISSIONS IN SAN SALVADOR. NIGHT BOMBINGS ARE CARRIED OUT EXCLUSIVELY BY THESE YANKEE PILOTS, AND THEY ARE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXTENSIVE DAMAGE INFLICTED AMONG THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. 4. ON 15 NOVEMBER, COMPANY TROOPS FROM GUATEMALA ARRIVED IN OUR COUNTRY AS A RESULT OF PRESSURE BY THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION TO GET REGIONAL ARMIES TO INTERVENE IN THE SALVADORAN WAR. THE FMLN BELIEVES THAT THESE ARE VERY SERIOUS DEVELOPMENTS THAT COULD LEAD TO THE EXPANSION OF THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT TO THE REST OF THE REGION. WE CALL ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND, PARTICULARLY, ON THE U.S. PUBLIC TO DENOUNCE BEFORE THE WORLD THE ESCALATION OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S MEDDLING IN EL SALVADOR. WE WARN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ABOUT THE DANGER OF THIS ESCALATION AND THAT WE WILL NOT BE THE ONES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS OF NORTH AMERICANS IN OUR FATHERLAND. WE CALL ON CENTRAL AMERICA'S PRESIDENTS TO BECOME AWARE THAT THIS U.S. INTERVENTION HARMS THE ESQUIPULAS AND TELA ACCORDS AND CONSTITUTES A DIRECT ATTACK ON THE REGION'S PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIZATION AND PEACE. FMLN GENERAL COMMAND -- COMMANDERS FRANCISCO JOVEL, JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, SALVADOR SANCHEZ CEREN, AND EDUARDO SANCHO, SHAFIK JORGE HANDAL EL SALVADOR, 16 NOVEMBER 1989
DEV-MUC3-0762	CLANDESTINE, 16 NOV 89 -- IN VIEW OF THE SINISTER MASSACRE OF JESUIT PRIESTS TODAY, THE FMLN REPORTS THE FOLLOWING TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE: 1. THE MASSACRE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS IGNACIO ELLACURIA, SEGUNDO MONTES, IGNACIO MARTIN BARO, JOAQUIN LOPEZ, AMANDO LOPEZ, AND JUAN RAMON MORENO, ALONG WITH MRS JULIA ELBA RAMOS AND HER DAUGHTER CELINA RAMOS, WAS PERPETRATED BY ARMED FORCES DEATH SQUADS AT DAWN TODAY. A GROUP OF ABOUT 30 MEN DRESSED IN GREEN STORMED INTO THE PRIESTS' RESIDENCE AND RIDDLED THEM WITH BULLETS FIRED FROM HEAVY CALIBER WEAPONS. THREE OF THE BODIES WERE DRAGGED OUT TO THE PATIO WHERE THEY WERE GIVEN DEATH BLOWS THAT COMPLETELY CRUSHED THEIR SKULLS. 2. THIS ABSURD MASSACRE AND THE GENOCIDAL BOMBINGS AGAINST HEAVILY POPULATED AREAS IN SAN SALVADOR AND SAN MIGUEL HAVE BEEN ORDERED BY ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE ARMED FORCES' HIGH COMMAND, AND ARE PART OF A COUNTERINSURGENT PLAN TO DESTROY THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION AND CREATE A STATE OF TERROR AMONG THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. PUBLIC DEATH THREATS WERE MADE AGAINST PRIEST IGNACIO ELLACURIA OVER THE ARMED FORCES NATIONAL NETWORK. THE NIGHT OF WEDNESDAY, 15 NOVEMBER, THE SECURITY CORPS SEARCHED THE OFFICES OF THE OPPOSITION GROUPS LOOKING FOR THE LEADERS IN ORDER TO KILL THEM. THIS IS THE SAME SCHEME THEY USED IN 1979 AND 1980 WHEN THEY MURDERED MONSIGNOR ROMERO AND MASSACRED THE REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT LEADERS, UNIVERSITY RECTOR DR FELIX ULLOA, AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS. 3. THERE IS NO ROOM FOR DOUBT THAT THE ARENA REGIME AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE FASCIST BEASTS THAT HAVE BEEN MORTALLY WOUNDED. THEREFORE, WE CALL ON DEMOCRATIC PEOPLES AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS TO PROTEST SUCH AN UNFORTUNATE MASSACRE, AND ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO ISOLATE THE FASCIST REGIME OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI. 4. WE CALL ON THE ARMED FORCES OFFICERS WHO KNEW FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA -- AND RESPECTED HIM FOR HIS PAST HISTORY IN THE FIELDS OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH, AND SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OF THE TRUE SITUATION -- TO TAKE A DIGNIFIED AND DETERMINED STAND AND NOT STAIN THEIR HANDS WITH THE BLOOD OF GENOCIDE. THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HONEST PATRIOTS IN THE ARMED FORCES WHO DO NOT HAVE TO SINK WITH THE CRIMINALS. WE OFFER THEM OUR HANDS, SO THAT TOGETHER WE WILL SAVE THE COUNTRY, AND SO THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SAVE PART OF THE ARMED FORCES. ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE ARMED FORCES ASSASSINATED THE JESUIT PRIESTS, BUT THEY ARE COMMITTING SUICIDE. 5. THE FMLN CONDEMNS THIS CRIME AND JOINS IN THE SORROW OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WHO LOSE IN SUCH AN ABSURD MANNER SOME OF THE MOST APPRECIATED INTELLECTUALS OF OUR COUNTRY. THEIR INTELLIGENCE AND SENSIBILITY WERE ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF CHANGE AND PROGRESS IN OUR SOCIETY. THEIR WORK WILL BE ETERNAL, AND THE FASCIST IRRATIONALITY WILL NEVER PUT AN END TO THAT WORK. WE CALL ALL OF OUR COMMANDS, FIGHTERS, MILITANTS, AND OUR PEOPLE IN GENERAL, TO UNTIRING COMBAT. THIS STRUGGLE IS THE ONLY ANSWER WE HAVE FOR THIS DESPICABLE MASSACRE. WE MUST OUST ARENA AND LA TANDONA . THE FATHERLAND IS COUNTING ON OUR STRENGTH AND OUR DETERMINATION, AND WE WILL NOT FAIL THE FATHERLAND. FMLN GENERAL COMMAND: COMMANDER SHAFIK JORGE HANDAL, COMMANDER JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, COMMANDER FRANCISCO JOVEL, COMMANDER SALVADOR SANCHEZ CEREN, COMMANDER EDUARDO SANCHO 16 NOVEMBER 1989
DEV-MUC3-0763	SAN SALVADOR, 16 NOV 89 -- THE FIGHTING BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN ARMY AND THE GUERRILLAS AND THE CONSTANT AIR FORCE BOMBINGS OF POPULATED AREAS CONTINUED FOR THE 6TH CONSECUTIVE DAY TODAY, WHILE THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS FLED FROM THE MAIN AREAS OF FIGHTING. IN SAN SALVADOR, ESPECIALLY IN NORTHWESTERN NEIGHBORHOODS, EFE REPORTERS WERE ABLE TO CONFIRM THE PERSISTENT CLASHES AND CONTINUOUS LAUNCHING OF ROCKETS BY AIR FORCE PUSH AND PULL AIRCRAFT AGAINST THE REBEL POSITIONS IN DENSELY POPULATED AREAS. AT LEAST TWO BLOCKS OF HOMES IN LOW-INCOME ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD HAVE BEEN ABLAZE SINCE MID-MORNING AS A RESULT OF THE REBEL OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED ON SATURDAY, WHICH HAS LEFT MORE THAN 600 DEAD AND 1,000 WOUNDED. THE NEIGHBORHOODS OF ZACAMIL, MEJICANOS, AYUTUXTEPEQUE, AND CUSCATANCINGO ARE THE PRINCIPAL AREAS OF FIGHTING IN THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL WHERE, ACCORDING TO ARMY SOURCES, THE MILITARY HAVE "LAID SIEGE TO THE REBELS AND WILL EVICT THEM IN A FEW HOURS." THE SALVADORAN ARMY, SUPPORTED BY AIRCRAFT AND ARTILLERY, ARE ATTACKING THESE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE APPROXIMATELY 300,000 PERSONS LIVE AND WHERE THE GUERRILLAS HAVE TAKEN UP POSITIONS. FOR THEIR PART, SPOKESMEN FOR THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT , ENTRENCHED IN BUILDINGS AND BEHIND BARRICADES IN DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS CLAIM THAT THEY "WILL NOT RETREAT" AND THAT "THEY HAVE CONSOLIDATED THEIR POSITIONS IN THE CAPITAL AND OTHER CITIES OF THE COUNTRY." ACCORDING TO THE FMLN, FIGHTING IS UNDER WAY IN AT LEAST 7 OF THE 24 DEPARTMENTS OF EL SALVADOR, WHILE THE FIERCEST CLASHES ARE TAKING PLACE IN USULUTAN, LA PAZ, SAN MIGUEL, AND MORAZAN IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. INDEPENDENT CIVILIAN SOURCES REPORTED THAT IN THE COUNTRY'S EASTERN DEPARTMENT OF SAN MIGUEL THE GUERRILLAS HAVE OCCUPIED POSITIONS IN VARIOUS NEIGHBORHOODS, WHICH ARE UNDER HEAVY AIR AND ARTILLERY FIRE. HOWEVER, THE ARMY AND THE GOVERNMENT CLAIM THAT THE SITUATION IS UNDER CONTROL THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, AND THAT "THERE ARE GUERRILLA REDOUBTS" IN SAN SALVADOR ONLY. MEANWHILE, THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS IN NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE CLASHES ARE TAKING PLACE ARE SEEN RUNNING TERRIFIED THROUGH THE STREETS OF SAN SALVADOR SEEKING PLACES OF REFUGE. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE -- MEN AND WOMEN WITH CHILDREN IN THEIR ARMS -- CAN BE SEEN CARRYING A FEW BELONGINGS AND HOLDING WHITE FLAGS AS THEY WALK TO SHELTERS OPENED BY VARIOUS CHURCHES, WHERE THEY RECEIVE FOOD AND MEDICINE. THE PRECARIOUS SITUATION OF THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS "IS VERY THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES. THE EXODUS OF SALVADORANS HAS GROWN EVEN MORE IN VIEW OF THE STRICT SECURITY MEASURES IMPLEMENTED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, SUCH AS THE STATE OF SIEGE AND THE 24-HOUR CURFEW ENFORCED IN THE DEPARTMENTS WHERE CLASHES ARE TAKING PLACE AND 12 HOURS IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. SO FAR WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES AS A RESULT OF CLASHES AND THE BOMBINGS THAT TOOK PLACE LAST NIGHT AND THIS MORNING. THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO ENTER THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE CLASHES ARE TAKING PLACE DUE TO THE HEAVY FIGHTING, AND THE AUTHORITIES HAVE REJECTED A PROPOSAL FOR A TEMPORARY TRUCE TO EVACUATE THE WOUNDED AND PERMIT THE BURIAL OF BODIES STILL LAYING IN THE STREETS OF SAN SALVADOR.
DEV-MUC3-0764	SAN SALVADOR, 16 NOV 89 -- ATTENTION. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION. ZACAMIL, CUSCATANCINGO, AND SOYOPANGO RESIDENTS: IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU LEAVE YOUR HOMES IMMEDIATELY TO KEEP THE FMLN TERRORISTS FROM USING THEM AS PLACES WHERE THEY CAN SHIELD THEMSELVES FROM THE VICTORIOUS ADVANCES OF OUR ARMED FORCES. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS OFFERED THE FOLLOWING PLACES TO BE USED AS REFUGE: BUEN SAMARITANO SCHOOL IS READY TO ACCEPT SANTA MARTA RESIDENTS, AND SAN ROQUE PARRISH, WE CORRECT OURSELVES, IT IS THE JESUS OBRERO PAROCHIAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO OPEN. REFUGE CAN ALSO BE TAKEN AT THESE FOLLOWING SCHOOLS: SAN JOSE BOARDING SCHOOL, SAGRADO CORAZON, AND LA ASUNCION. THIS URGENT CALL IS MADE PRIMARILY FOR FAMILIES WHOSE HOUSES ARE CLOSE TO THE LAST TERRORIST POCKETS LOCATED IN THE PLACES MENTIONED. WE DO ALL THIS FOR THE SAFETY OF YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. WE ASK YOU TO COME OUT WITH WHITE FLAGS AND YOUR HANDS UP HIGH. TOGETHER -- GOVERNMENT, PEOPLE, AND THE ARMED FORCES -- WE ADVANCE TOWARD PEACE.
DEV-MUC3-0765	SAN SALVADOR, 16 NOV 89 -- COMMANDER FACUNDO GUARDADO, ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA MOVEMENT IN THE PAST DECADE, TODAY SAID THAT THE ARMY'S COUNTEROFFENSIVE IN SAN SALVADOR "IS AT A STALEMATE," WHILE THE "REBELS ARE ADVANCING." GUARDADO, WEARING AN OLIVE GREEN UNIFORM, TOLD THE PRESS THAT THE GUERRILLAS' OFFENSIVE, WHICH BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER, SURPRISED THE ARMED FORCES AND THE UNITED STATES, WHICH HAS "MOTIVATED WARMONGERING SECTORS IN THIS COUNTRY TO CONTINUE REPRESSION." THE GUERRILLA LEADER, KNOWN AS "ESTEBAN," SAID: "WE ARE WILLING TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE GOVERNMENT A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE WAR FROM HERE , WHILE WE CONTINUE TO HOLD THESE TERRITORIES ." HE ADDED: "WE WOULD HAVE TO ASK ARMY CHIEFS IF THESE ARE THE SO-CALLED UNDELIMITED BORDER AREAS BORDERING HONDURAS." THE SALVADORAN ARMY HAS REPEATEDLY CHARGED THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT WITH SEEKING REFUGE IN "UNDELIMITED BORDER AREAS" IN DISPUTE WITH HONDURAS. GUARDADO WAS INTERVIEWED NEAR A CLINIC IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR. HE WAS SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO COMPLAINED TO THE PRESS OF THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE'S "INDISCRIMINATE" BOMBINGS. "WE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE OUR HOMES. WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO. WE ASK YOU TO REPORT THAT THE AIR FORCE IS BOMBING THESE NEIGHBORHOODS," A MAN WHO WAS CARRYING A WHITE FLAG AND SAYING GOOD-BYE TO HIS NEIGHBORS SAID. THE GUERRILLAS PRESENTED TO THE PRESS TWO SOLDIERS WHO WERE DETAINED ON 15 NOVEMBER AS SOLDIERS TRIED TO EXPEL REBELS FROM MEJICANOS, A DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOOD IN SAN SALVADOR. THE SOLDIERS, APPROXIMATELY 25 YEARS OLD, IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS JOSE FRANCISCO RAMIREZ AND SANTOS LOPEZ. "WE WERE CAPTURED YESTERDAY. WE WERE TREATED WELL AND HAVE BEEN FED. WE DO NOT CONSIDER OURSELVES PRISONERS OF WAR," RAMIREZ SAID. LOPEZ SAID HE HAD ENTERED THE MEJICANOS AREA WITH 45 OTHER SOLDIERS, BUT "ALL OF THEM LEFT."
DEV-MUC3-0766	SAN SALVADOR, 16 NOV 89 -- WHEN ANSWERING A QUESTION ON THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE SIX JESUITS AND TWO OTHER PERSONS COULD HAVE BEEN MURDERED BY THE MILITARY, SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI SAID TODAY THAT "IF THE ARMED FORCES PEOPLE DID IT, THE WEIGHT OF THE LAW WILL FALL ALSO ON THEM." CRISTIANI "STRONGLY CONDEMNED" THE MULTIPLE MURDER THAT TOOK PLACE EARLY THIS MORNING AND ATTRIBUTED IT TO "GROUPS OR MINDS THAT WANT TO HINDER THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRACY AND PEACE THAT HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT IN EL SALVADOR." THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WAS DETERMINED "TO INVESTIGATE THIS TO THE VERY END, REGARDLESS OF WHO DID IT." HE EMPHASIZED THAT IT IS TOO EARLY "TO GIVE ANY OPINION" ON WHO COULD HAVE COMMITTED THE MURDERS, POINTING OUT THAT THE FACT THE MEN WHO DID IT WERE WEARING UNIFORMS AND WERE MOVING AT NIGHT DURING THE STRICT CURFEW IN THE CITY "IS NOT CONCLUSIVE." CRISTIANI SAID THAT "THE ARMED FORCES AS WELL AS THE GUERRILLA GROUPS MOVE DURING THE CURFEW HOURS." HE STATED THAT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF, WITH WHOM HE MET THIS MORNING TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE, HE HAS ORDERED AN INVESTIGATION. THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT DISCLOSED THE EXISTENCE OF "A POSSIBLE WITNESS THAT HAS NOT BEEN INTERROGATED BY THOSE WHO ARE CARRYING OUT THE INVESTIGATION" AND WHO HAVE FINGERPRINTS AND EMPTY CARTRIDGES OF BULLETS FOR AK-47S AND M-16S. CRISTIANI DISAVOWED VERSIONS REPORTED DURING THE DAY BY THE GOVERNMENT RADIO NETWORK THAT CLAIM THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GUERRILLAS COMMITTED THE MURDER. IN ANOTHER PART OF HIS NEWS CONFERENCE, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ADMITTED THAT WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES "THERE MIGHT GROUPS OF PERSONS WHO DO NOT AGREE WITH THE GOVERNMENT," BUT HE ADDED THAT "AS AN INSTITUTION, THEY ARE WITH THE GOVERNMENT."
DEV-MUC3-0767	SAN SALVADOR, 16 NOV 89 -- SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI STATED TODAY HIS GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE WITH THE GUERRILLAS, BUT ONLY IF IT DESISTS FROM VIOLENCE AND JOINS THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. "WE WILL NOT LEND OURSELVES TO ANY GAME WITH THE GUERRILLAS. WHILE SPEAKING OF PEACE, THEY PREPARED THIS ACTION" , CRISTIANI STATED, NOTING THAT THE REBELS "ARE GOING TO ANY LENGTH TO TRY TO ACHIEVE POWER THROUGH VIOLENT MEANS." "IF HOSTILITIES DO NOT CEASE ON THE PART OF THE GUERRILLAS, THERE WILL NOT BE ANY DIALOGUE. THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT LEND ITSELF TO THIS GAME," HE INSISTED. THE PRESIDENT STATED AT A NEWS CONFERENCE THAT THE ARMY "HAS CONTROLLED" NATIONAL TERRITORY, ALTHOUGH HE ADMITTED THAT IN SOME PLACES, ESPECIALLY IN NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE CAPITAL, CLASHES ARE STILL TAKING PLACE WITH THE REBELS. CRISTIANI STATED THAT COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS "IS VERY DISTURBED AND TERMED THE REBELS CYNICAL," BECAUSE WHILE THEY SPOKE OF PEACE THEY WERE PREPARING THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED ON SATURDAY. THE PRESIDENT AGAIN DENIED THAT THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE IS INDISCRIMINATELY BOMBING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. HE SAID THAT ONLY TWICE HAVE BOMBS BEEN USED, THE FIRST TIME IN AN OPEN FIELD OF THE UNIVERSITY OF EL SALVADOR WHERE MORTARS WERE POSITIONED, AND AGAIN LAST NIGHT IN THE VICINITY OUTSIDE THE AIR FORCE GARRISONS. CRISTIANI STATED THAT THE GUERRILLAS USED BOMBS LAST NIGHT AGAINST THE AIR FORCE IN EASTERN SAN SALVADOR AND WERE REPELLED BY AIRCRAFT WHICH DROPPED BOMBS. THE PRESIDENT STRESSED THAT THE ARMY HAS NOT EVICTED THE GUERRILLAS FROM POSITIONS IN THE NORTHWESTERN NEIGHBORHOODS OF SAN SALVADOR SO AS "NOT TO AFFECT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION." HE ADDED THAT FRANCE AND GUATEMALA HAVE OFFERED TO DONATE MEDICINE FOR THE THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS WHO HAVE HAD TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES AS A RESULT OF THE INTENSE FIGHTING BETWEEN THE ARMY AND GUERRILLAS SINCE THE OFFENSIVE BEGAN, CAUSING APPROXIMATELY 1,000 DEATHS.
DEV-MUC3-0768	SAN SALVADOR, 16 NOV 89 -- FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. BRIEFLY, BEFORE BEGINNING THE QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION, WE WOULD LIKE TO SAY BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS THAT WE CONDEMN IN THE STRONGEST TERMS THE MURDERS OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THEIR COOK, AND HER DAUGHTER EARLY THIS MORNING AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY, UCA. WE FEEL THAT THESE INCIDENTS FURTHER COMPLICATE OUR COUNTRY'S CRITICAL SITUATION. GROUPS OR MINDS WANT TO HAMPER THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, ESPECIALLY THE PEACE PROCESS THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS TRIED TO ADVANCE AND WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE. FROM THE START WE ORDERED AN INVESTIGATION BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT NOW THAT THE PEOPLE AND ALL OF THE COUNTRY'S INSTITUTIONS HAVE SUPPORTED THE PEACE PROCESS, IT IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE TO CONTINUE HAVING THESE SAVAGE INCIDENTS TAKE PLACE THAT ARE AIMED AT BLOCKING THIS PROCESS. WE HAVE MADE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS THAT MERELY TELL US HOW THINGS HAPPENED. WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN SOME PROCEDURAL STEPS, SUCH AS WHERE THE IMPACT WAS FELT AND WHERE THE CRIMES WERE PERPETRATED. IN SUM, WE DID THE THINGS NORMALLY DONE AT THE START OF THESE KINDS OF INVESTIGATIONS. THERE IS A POSSIBLE WITNESS TO THESE CRIMES, BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, HE HAS NOT BEEN LOCATED SO THAT HE CAN BE QUESTIONED BY THE INVESTIGATORS. THEY WILL CERTAINLY MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO LOCATE HIM SO THAT HE CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT WILL CLARIFY THIS REGRETTABLE INCIDENT. I SUPPOSE THE JESUITS' PROVINCIAL WILL HOST A NEWS CONFERENCE. YOU HAVE MANY OF THE DETAILS, SO WE ARE GOING TO SKIP THEM. THE ONLY THINGS WE HAVE FOUND ARE FINGERPRINTS THAT ARE BEING STUDIED AND SHELL CASINGS FROM AK-47 AND M-16 RIFLES. WE WILL SUBMIT THEM FOR BALLISTIC TESTS. WE WILL ALSO CONDUCT FORENSIC TESTS, WHICH WILL BEGIN SOON. ANOTHER IMPORTANT DETAIL IS THAT INSIDE THE BUILDING THERE WAS A ROOM OR LIBRARY WITH VIDEO CASSETTES. IT WAS LIKE A STUDIO. THIS ROOM LOOKED LIKE IT HAD BEEN BURNED AFTER BEING RANSACKED. ALL THESE THINGS AND OTHER DETAILS HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND SUBMITTED TO THE INVESTIGATORS. WE ALSO TALKED TO THE JESUITS' PROVINCIAL AND TOLD HIM THAT WE WERE DETERMINED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS. WE ASKED HIM FOR HIS HELP, AND HE EXPRESSED HIS READINESS TO ASSIST IN THE INVESTIGATION. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THIS HELP BECAUSE IN THE PAST COOPERATION WITH THE AUTHORITIES HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN FORTHCOMING. WE HOPE THAT WITH THIS HELP AND WITH THE REMARKS BY MSGR ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS, WITH WHOM WE ALSO SPOKE THIS MORNING, THIS CASE WILL NOT BE POLITICIZED AND JUSTICE CAN BE SERVED, AVOIDING REACHING HASTY OR BIASED CONCLUSIONS BY ANY OF GROUP OR PARTY. WE THINK AND AGREE WITH MSGR RIVERA Y DAMAS THAT THIS IS HOW A SERIOUS INVESTIGATION SHOULD BE CONDUCTED. WE HOPE THAT THIS INVESTIGATION WILL LEAD US TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER. REGARDLESS OF WHO THE PERPETRATORS ARE, WE WANT PUNISHMENT FOR THOSE ATTEMPTING TO HINDER THE PROCESS OF PEACE AND DEMOCRACY IN EL SALVADOR. AND SO WE BEGIN THE QUESTIONS. PERHAPS MR SANDOVAL OR ANA MARIA MAY WANTO HELP US TO PUT SOME ORDER . FIRST, THE GOVERNMENT COMMUNIQUE REPEATS ECO ECO REPORTS, WHICH MENTION UNKNOWN TERRORISTS. REGARDLESS OF THE SIDE THAT IS INVOLVED, THIS IS THE WAY TO DESCRIBE THESE ACTIONS. THESE ARE TERRORIST ACTIONS BECAUSE OF THEIR OVERALL CONTEXT, NO MATTER WHO . LET ME REPEAT: WE HAVE COMMENTS BY CHURCH OFFICIALS WHO WERE GIVING VERSIONS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CORROBORATED. WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THERE WERE SEVERAL PERSONS WEARING UNIFORMS, TO CITE THESE VERSIONS VERBATIM. I DO NOT WANT TO EXCUSE OR ACCUSE ANYONE, BUT I FEEL THAT IS NOT A CATEGORICAL PROOF. TODAY, MANY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT BELONG TO THE ARMED FORCES ARE WEARING UNIFORMS. LET ME REPEAT: ONE CANNOT SAY ONE THING OR ANOTHER, BUT I DO THINK THIS MUST BE INVESTIGATED. IF MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES ARE FOUND TO BE INVOLVED, THEY WILL FEEL THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE LAW.
DEV-MUC3-0769	PARIS , 16 NOV 89 -- THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX MEMBERS OF HIS ORDER, INCLUDING IGNACIO ELLACURIA, RECTOR OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY , "ARE THE SAME ONES WHO KILLED MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO, ARCHBISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR." "I DO NOT WANT TO ACCUSE ANYONE, BUT IT IS OBVIOUS WHERE THE FACTS ARE POINTING," JOSE MARIA TOJEIRA STATED AT A NEWS CONFERENCE HELD THIS AFTERNOON IN THE UCA CHAPEL, ONLY A FEW METERS FROM WHERE THE JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO DOMESTICS WERE KILLED THIS MORNING. THE BODIES OF ELLACURIA AND HIS JESUIT COMPANIONS IGNACIO MARTIN BARO, SEGUNDO MONTES, JUAN RAMON MORENO, ARMANDO LOPEZ, AND JOAQUIN LOPEZ, AS WELL AS DOMESTIC ELBA RAMOS AND HER 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, WERE RIDDLED WITH BULLETS, WHILE SOME ALSO HAD THEIR SKILLS CRUSHED. THE DEATH OF THE PRIESTS, FIVE OF THEM SPANIARDS, WHO WERE ALWAYS IN FAVOR OF A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS, HAS INCREASED THE FEAR AND DESPERATION FELT BY THE SALVADORANS SINCE THE PAST WEEKEND, WHEN VIOLENT FIGHTING BROKE OUT BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND SOLDIERS IN THE NORTHERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR. THE PRIESTS WERE KILLED BY SOME 30 MEN WEARING OLIVE DRAB UNIFORMS WHO BROKE INTO THE PLACE, ACCORDING TO WITNESSES WHO WERE THERE, TOJEIRA EXPLAINED. THE PRIEST RECALLED THAT OVER THE WEEKEND THE GOVERNMENT RADIO NETWORK "LAUNCHED FIERCE ATTACKS AGAINST THE , SAYING THAT A FEW PRIESTS HAD TO BE KILLED IN THIS COUNTRY OR THAT THEY HAD TO BE PLACED IN FRONT OF THE CATHEDRAL SO THAT THE PEOPLE COULD KILL THEM BY SPITTING AT THEM," TOJERA NOTED. ALSO, HE ADDED THAT ON MONDAY ARMED FORCES MEMBERS RAIDED THE HOMES OF ELLACURIA AND COMPANIONS. "ON THAT OCCASION THEY WERE QUITE CORRECT, ACCORDING TO WHAT FATHER ELLACURIA TOLD ME," ADDED TOJEIRA, WHO WAS QUITE UPSET DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE. "APPARENTLY THE MEN SAID THEY HAD REPORTS THAT THERE WERE WEAPONS IN THE RESIDENCES. OF COURSE THEY FOUND NOTHING, AND FATHER ELLACURIA INVITED THEM TO RETURN ON TUESDAY AND GO THROUGH THE UCA CAMPUS, BUT THEY DID NOT DO SO." ALSO, TOJEIRA CONFIRMED THAT ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING THERE WAS TIGHT SECURITY IN THE VICINITY OF THE UCA IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE CAPITAL. "I DO NOT KNOW IF THE SOLDIERS LEFT THE PLACE LATER, BUT UP UNTIL 2200 ON WEDNESDAY, HOURS BEFORE THE HORRIBLE MASSACRE, THE SOLDIERS WERE THERE," TOJEIRA ADDED. "THESE ARE THE FACTS. THEREFORE, WE SHARE THE OPINION OF ARCHBISHOP ARTURO RIVERA -- THAT THE ONES RESPONSIBLE ARE THE SAME ONES WHO ASSASSINATED MSGR ROMERO," HE ADDED.
DEV-MUC3-0770	GUATEMALA CITY, 9 NOV 89 -- IN AN ANALYSIS OF THE VIOLENCE DURING THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER, THE INFORMATION OFFICE OF THE BUSINESS SECTOR POINTS OUT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE AN ATMOSPHERE OF SECURITY FOR THE PEOPLE SO THAT THE ECONOMY CAN MOVE IN A MANNER FAVORABLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY. THE STATISTICS ON THE SEPTEMBER VIOLENCE -- TAKEN FROM THE MEDIA -- SHOW THERE IS A SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT IN SOME ASPECTS, BUT THE PREVAILING SITUATION IS OF GREAT CONCERN, THE BUSINESSMEN ADD. IN A COMPARISON OF THE STATISTICS FOR AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER, IT IS NOTED THAT 142 MURDERS WERE REPORTED IN SEPTEMBER WHILE 126 WERE REPORTED IN AUGUST. OFISEM ALSO REPORTS THAT 17 KIDNAP CASES WERE REPORTED IN SEPTEMBER, AGAINST 19 CASES IN AUGUST. AS FOR MISSING PERSONS, THERE WERE 12 REPORTED IN SEPTEMBER AND 19 IN AUGUST.

OFICEM ONCE AGAIN URGES THE AUTHORITIES TO INCREASE THEIR ACTIVITIES TO PROTECT THE SECURITY OF THE GUATEMALANS, WHO DESERVE TO LIVE IN PEACE IN AN ATMOSPHERE THAT IS CONDUCIVE FOR THE PROGRESS OF GUATEMALA.
DEV-MUC3-0771	SAN SALVADOR, 16 NOV 89 -- SALVADORAN PEOPLE: AFTER 5 DAYS OF COMBAT, CONFRONTING THIS ARMED AGGRESSION BY THE FMLN TERRORISTS, I WANT TO INFORM YOU OF THE SITUATION THROUGHOUT THE NATION: IN THE WESTERN AREA, THERE ARE NO PROBLEMS. IN THE EASTERN AREA, THERE ARE STILL PROBLEMS. IN SAN MIGUEL CITY, THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE COMMAND HAS BEEN OPERATING IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER, AND IT HAS AVOIDED HARMING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION; THEREFORE, THERE ARE TERRORISTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS. ALSO IN USULUTAN LAST NIGHT AND EARLY THIS MORNING, BUT AT PRESENT ONLY SOME EXPLOSIONS AND SOME SPORADIC FIRING ARE HEARD IN THE VICINITY OF THE CITY OF USULUTAN. IN ZACATECOLUCA YESTERDAY WE MANAGED TO CONTROL THE POPULATION COMPLETELY. WE DISLODGED THE TERRORISTS FROM THE 27 SEPTEMBER NEIGHBORHOOD. WE HAVE HAD SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN THE CAPITAL CITY. THE FMLN HAS WAGED ITS GREATEST EFFORTS HERE. THEY ARE TERRORISTS, AND THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS SUCH. IN SOME NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE NORTHERN AREA, THE MEJICANOS, AS OF SUNDAY, 12 NOVEMBER. IN SOME AS IT WAS YESTERDAY. ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE OF THE CAPITAL CITY. IN MEJICANOS, IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, NORTH OF THE GUADALUPE AND SOYAPANGO NEIGHBORHOODS, REPARTO SANTA MARTA, AND ALTOS DEL . IN THIS AREA, THE ARMED FORCES HAVE CARRIED OUT ACTIONS TO DEFEND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO NEUTRALIZE THIS GENOCIDE . ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL, I WOULD LIKE TO ANNOUNCE SOME PARTIAL RESULTS. THE ARMED FORCES HAVE SUSTAINED THE FOLLOWING: 177 DEAD AND 251 WOUNDED. AMONG THE TERRORISTS THERE ARE 655 DEAD AND 491 WOUNDED. WE HAVE CAPTURED 92 FMLN MEMBERS, AND 6 FMLN TERRORISTS HAVE TURNED THEMSELVES IN. AS FOR THE CIVILIANS, WE REGRET 47 PERSONS HAVE DIED, AND 153 HAVE BEEN WOUNDED. THE ARMED FORCES HAVE SEIZED FROM THE FMLN TERRORISTS 324 RIFLES, 75 GRENADE AND ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 26 MORTARS, 8 MACHINEGUNS, 15 SUBMACHINEGUNS, AND 40 WEAPONS OF OTHER TYPES. FOUR ARSENALS HAVE ALSO IN MEJICANOS, WHERE THE TERRORISTS HAD A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF AMMUNITION AND EXPLOSIVES. SALVADORAN PEOPLE: YOU MUST HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOUR ARMED FORCES AND IN YOUR GOVERNMENT BECAUSE WE ARE WORKING JOINTLY. OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF IS UP TO DATE ON THE SITUATION, AND , AND WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER. THE ARMED FORCES IS WORKING IN A VERY PROFESSIONAL MANNER. YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT WE CANNOT RESOLVE THIS SITUATION BY ENDANGERING THE LIVES OF INNOCENT PEOPLE. THAT IS WHY IT TAKES LONGER FOR THE ARMED FORCES TO DO THINGS. ON BEHALF OF THE ARMED FORCES, WE WANT TO THANK YOU, OUR PEOPLE, FOR YOUR SUPPORT, AS YOU HAVE BEEN PROVIDING US WITH PLENTY OF INFORMATION, SUPPORTING OUR TROOPS IN THE VARIOUS COMBAT AREAS, AND-- MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL--CONDEMNING AND REJECTING THIS TERRORIST ATTACK. THAT IS THE OF THE FMLN. WE ARE ALL WORKING, STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM, TO MAINTAIN FREEDOM , AND ACHIEVE PEACE. I ALSO WANT TO INFORM YOU THAT AFTER VISITING THIS AFTERNOON THE VARIOUS AREAS WHERE WE ARE , THE MORALE OF OUR TROOPS AND OFFICERS IS VERY HIGH. AND THERE IS A REASON FOR THIS, BECAUSE THEY ARE FIGHTING TO DEFEND YOU. THE FMLN TERRORISTS HAVE A VERY LOW MORALE, MANY, BECAUSE THEY ARE NOW AWARE OF THEIR CASUALTIES AND . I WANT TO AVAIL MYSELF OF THIS OPPORTUNITY AND ON BEHALF OF THE ARMED FORCES, TO STRONGLY CONDEMN THOSE WHO THIS MORNING MASSACRED SIX JESUIT PRIESTS. WE REGRET AS WELL THE DEATHS OF OTHER CIVILIANS, INNOCENT PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS CONFLICT. WE ALSO REGRET THE DEATHS AMONG OUR ARMED FORCES. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT THE GOVERNMENT, THE PEOPLE, AND THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL COMMAND ARE PROUD OF THE PROFESSIONAL WORK BEING DONE AT THE VARIOUS GARRISONS OF OUR ARMED FORCES. SALVADORAN PEOPLE, ON BEHALF OF THE ARMED FORCES, WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. YOU MUST CONTINUE GOING TO WORK AND CONTINUE WORKING. IN CONCLUSION, I WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE ONCE AGAIN FOR THEIR MORAL AND MATERIAL SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES AT SUCH A DIFFICULT TIME.
DEV-MUC3-0772	CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 -- SIX DAYS AFTER HAVING INITIATED OUR OFFENSIVE IN THE CAPITAL CITY AND THE ENTIRE COUNTRY, THERE HAS BEEN AN OVERWHELMING TREND TOWARD THE CONSOLIDATION AND BROADENING OF FMLN POSITIONS IN IMPORTANT CITIES AND TOWNS IN THE COUNTRY, WHICH HAVE PLAYED LEADING ROLES BECAUSE THE PEOPLE HAVE SUPPORTED AND JOINED THE STRUGGLE. TODAY WE COMPLETED AN ARCH OF FREEDOM IN SAN SALVADOR BY EXTENDING AND CONNECTING SEVERAL AREAS UNDER OUR CONTROL, AFTER REPELLING AND SWAMPING THE GOVERNMENT'S SPECIAL BATTALIONS IN FIVE COUNTERATTACKS SUPPORTED BY ARMORED VEHICLES AND AERIAL BOMBINGS. OUR FIGHTERS DISPLAYED SINGULAR HEROISM DURING THE OCCUPATION OF THE CUSCATANCINGO HEADQUARTERS AND THE COMMANDS IN MEJICANOS AND CIUDAD DELGADO, WHERE WE CAPTURED A LARGE ARSENAL OF WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION, AND DURING CLASHES IN , SOYAPANGO, CIUDAD MERLIOT, AND . THE FMLN ALSO HAS FORCES ALONG THE LEADING ROUTES TO THE CAPITAL CITY; THESE FORCES HARASS AND HINDER ARMY DEPLOYMENTS ON THE PAN-AMERICAN HIGHWAY, AND ON THE SAN SALVADOR-SANTA TECLA HIGHWAY. WE NOW HIGHLIGHT OUR FORCES' FEATS: COMPANIES FORMED BY POPULAR FORCES HAVE EXTENDED THEIR CONTROL OVER NEW AREAS AND CITIES IN SAN MIGUEL AND USULUTAN, WHERE WEAPONS HAVE BEEN SEIZED AND PRISONERS OF WAR TAKEN. WE STRESS OUR PERMANENT HARASSMENT OF ENEMY FORCES IN ZACATECOLUCA, CHALATENANGO, SANTA ANA, APOPA, SAN MARTIN, SAN MARCOS, NUEVA CONCEPCION, SANTA ELENA, AND OTHER TOWNS. TRANSPORTATION HAS BEEN PARALYZED SINCE THE FMLN DECLARED A STOPPAGE, AND MOST OF THE COUNTRY IS WITHOUT ELECTRICITY DUE TO SABOTAGE. THE CRITICAL DEADLINE THE HIGH COMMAND SET FOR ITSELF TO RECOVER OUR POSITIONS HAS PASSED, AND OUR FORCES HAVE ASSAULTED HEADQUARTERS IN CONTROLLED AREAS AND HAVE REQUISITIONED WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION. HUNDREDS OF YOUTHS CONTINUE TO JOIN OUR ARMY. WITHOUT POPULAR SUPPORT THE FMLN WOULD NOT HAVE ACHIEVED POLITICAL-MILITARY VICTORIES OF SUCH DIMENSIONS AS TO TAKE THE ENEMY BY SURPRISE AND EARN THE WORLD'S ADMIRATION. IN THE PAST 2 DAYS THE FMLN HAS INFLICTED DOZENS OF CASUALTIES AMONG THE ARMY'S OFFICERS AND TROOPS, AND IT HAS TAKEN FIVE PRISONERS OF WAR, AMONG WHOM ARE A CAPTAIN AND A LIEUTENANT, WHOSE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WELL BEING HAS BEEN RESPECTED. THE FMLN HAS SEIZED 63 RIFLES, 4 MACHINEGUNS, 3 GRENADE LAUNCHERS, 5 PRC-77 RADIOS, , AND THOUSANDS OF ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION FROM THE OCCUPIED HEADQUARTERS AND COMMANDS. WE CALL ON ALL THE PEOPLE TO JOIN THE UPRISING AGAINST THE FASCIST GENOCIDE. WE ASK THE OFFICERS AND TROOPS NOT TO CONTINUE SERVING IN AN ARMY THAT IS BEHAVING LIKE A FOREIGN OCCUPATION ARMY, THE CIVILIAN POPULATION, EXECUTING PRIESTS, AND MASSACRING LABOR LEADERS. IN THE CITIES AND COUNTRYSIDE, A SEA OF GUERRILLAS .
DEV-MUC3-0773	CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 -- WE ARE IN CONTACT WITH SAN SALVADOR AND WE ARE RECEIVING MORE REPORTS ON THE PERSECUTION UNLEASHED AGAINST THE RELIGIOUS GROUPS IN SAN SALVADOR. WE REMIND YOU THAT A FEW WEEKS AGO COLONEL FRANCISCO ELENA FUENTES AND COLONEL INOCENTE ORLANDO MONTANO LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE LUTHERAN AND OTHER CHURCHES THROUGHOUT EL SALVADOR. NOW THIS CAMPAIGN, ORCHESTRATED BY COL ELENA FUENTES, CHIEF OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE'S DEATH SQUADS, HAS HEIGHTENED. NOT ONLY HAVE JESUIT PRIESTS BEEN MURDERED, BUT THIS MORNING THE NATIONAL GUARD ARRESTED TWO PRIESTS AND SEVERAL MISSIONARIES, INCLUDING A U.S. CITIZEN. WE REPEAT: TWO PRIESTS AND SEVERAL MISSIONARIES HAVE BEEN ARRESTED INCLUDING A U.S. CITIZEN. THESE PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED BY THE NATIONAL GUARD. WE CALL ON ALL THE AROUND THE WORLD; WE CALL ON ALL THE LATIN AMERICAN RELIGIOUS SECTORS TO MOBILIZE. TWO PRIESTS AND SEVERAL MISSIONARIES WERE ARRESTED THIS MORNING BY THE NATIONAL GUARD IN SAN SALVADOR. AMONG THE ARRESTED PERSONS IS A U.S. CITIZEN. RADIO VENCEREMOS IS IN CONTACT WITH SAN SALVADOR TO GATHER MORE DETAILED INFORMATION REGARDING THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE TWO PRIESTS AND SEVERAL MISSIONARIES, INCLUDING A U.S. CITIZEN, WHO WERE ARRESTED. THE PERSECUTION AGAINST THE CHURCH CONTINUES BY ARENA AND THE LA TANDONA MILITARY CLIQUE. RADIO VENCEREMOS CALLS ON ALL THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, ESPECIALLY THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE WORLD, THE LATIN AMERICAN COMMUNITY, TO MOBILIZE, OCCUPY SALVADORAN EMBASSIES, DEMONSTRATE IN FRONT OF SALVADORAN EMBASSIES AROUND THE WORLD AND DEMAND THE RELEASE OF THE PRIESTS WHO WERE ARRESTED THIS MORNING BY THE NATIONAL GUARD. 1 MINUTE FOR THE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY AROUND THE WORLD TO SPEAK OUT AND MOBILIZE TO PRESSURE PRESIDENT CRISTIANI. THIS COULD SAVE THE LIVES OF THE PERSONS ARRESTED THIS MORNING BY THE NATIONAL GUARD, A BLOODTHIRSTY GUARD THAT IS RELIVING THE LAST DAYS OF THE SOMOZIST GUARD. THE KILLING OF PRIESTS AND NOW THE ARREST OF TWO PRIESTS AND SEVERAL MISSIONARIES FURTHER CONFIRMS THAT THE REGIME IS ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSING, THAT IT IS DESPERATE AND NO LONGER CARES ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, PRESSURE, OR REQUESTS FOR AN END TO THE BOMBINGS AND BLOODSHED. THIS MORNING'S RESPONSE HAS BEEN THE ARREST OF TWO PRIESTS AND SEVERAL MISSIONARIES.
DEV-MUC3-0774	NO CITY, NO DATE -- ACTIONS SUCH AS THESE, ACCOMPANIED BY ORCHESTRATED SLANDEROUS CAMPAIGNS, SCARE AWAY INVESTMENTS FROM OUR COUNTRY AND THE HUMANITARIAN AID THAT WE NEED SO MUCH. DR CUSTODIO, THE SAME AS NORIEGA, CONTINUES TO DECEIVE THE PEOPLE AND EXPLOIT THEM TO FURTHER PERSONAL INTERESTS AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM. AS A BUREAUCRAT, , CUSTODIO OWNS MANY MATERIAL GOODS AND FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNTS, AND AS IF THIS WERE NOT ENOUGH, HE IS FUELING THE BONFIRE OF VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY ONLY TO RUN AWAY WHEN THE FIRE GIVES WAY TO CHAOS AND ANARCHY AMONG THE PEOPLE. HE WILL LEAVE THE COUNTRY WITH HIS INTERNATIONAL CONTACTS AND FEEL SATISFIED FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE. PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA CODEH HAS DONE NOTHING FOR PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA. QUITE THE CONTRARY, IT HAS DISCREDITED DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES AND SUPPORTED THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT OF DANIEL ORTEGA, WHO IS NOW DOING ALL HE CAN TO BOYCOTT FREE ELECTIONS TO WHICH THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO, AND TO MURDER THOSE WHO LAID DOWN THEIR ARMS AND ARE RETURNING TO THE COUNTRY IN SEARCH OF PEACE, DEMOCRACY, AND LIBERTY. CODEH HAS DONE NOTHING TO PROMOTE PEACE AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, BECAUSE IT IS SUPPORTING AND PROMOTING THE RECRUITMENT, TRAINING, AND ACTIONS OF GUERRILLA GROUPS, WHICH ARE DESTABILIZING AND SOWING VIOLENCE AMONG DEMOCRATIC PEOPLES. THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR. CODEH BELIEVES THAT THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT IS THE BEST ONE IN CENTRAL AMERICA. THE FSLN , WITH CUBA'S SUPPORT, IS CHANNELLING ARMS TO THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT OF EL SALVADOR TO MURDER INNOCENT SALVADORAN PEOPLE. ALL THIS IS TAKING PLACE WITH THE APPROVAL OF DR CUSTODIO AND HIS FINANCING SOURCES, WHICH REALIZE THAT THEIR STRATEGIC, IDEOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC, AND POLITICAL GOALS ARE COMING TRUE. CONCLUSION IN CONCLUSION: WHAT CAN THE HONDURAN PEOPLE EXPECT FROM DR CUSTODIO AND CODEH WHEN THEY WOULD RATHER DESTROY HONDURAS AND ITS PEOPLE TO INGRATIATE THEMSELVES WITH THE COMMUNISTS? WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED FROM A HUMAN RIGHTS "LEADER" WHO IS CONSTANTLY DENOUNCING CONDEMNATIONS AND ATTACKS AND DEFINES HIMSELF AS A PERSECUTED PERSON, AND WHO MANIPULATES PUBLIC OPINION TO GAIN NOTORIETY WHILE CREATING FEAR AND TERROR AMONG THE HONDURAN PEOPLE? WHAT FUTURE CAN HONDURAS EXPECT WHEN THE ALLEGED HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDER SPECIALIZES IN DISCREDITING THE HONDURAN PEOPLE ABROAD? WHAT CAN THE HONDURAN PEOPLE EXPECT WHEN CODEH COLLABORATES WITH AND SUPPORTS THE ARMING OF THE SANDINISTS, SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS, AND DICTATOR NORIEGA? DR CUSTODIO IS NOT BEING PERSECUTED FOR POLITICAL REASONS, HE IS NO HUMAN RIGHTS LEADER, AND HE HAS NOT BEEN CONDEMNED TO DEATH. HE IS SIMPLY A MAN WHO HAS CHOSEN THE WRONG PATH. WHILE COMMUNISM BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN, WHICH IS OVER 70 YEARS OLD, IS EMBRACING DEMOCRACY AS A WAY OF LIFE , HE INTENDS TO REPLACE DEMOCRACY FOR COMMUNISM AND LIBERTY FOR SLAVERY IN HONDURAS. DR CUSTODIO HAS SIMPLY MADE A MISTAKE AND HE STAYS ON HIS PATH THROUGH DECEIT AND LIES. DOWN WITH THE HONDURAN MARXIST-LENINIST TRAITORS! STOP INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM! STOP THE MANIPULATION OF THE HONDURAN PEOPLE! DEMOCRATS WILL NOT ALLOW THE ENSLAVEMENT AND MURDER OF THE PEOPLES! LET US STOP THOSE WHO MANIPULATE HUMAN RIGHTS OF OUR HONDURAS. FREE HONDURAS MOVEMENT
DEV-MUC3-0775	CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 -- WE RECENTLY HEARD U.S. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER ON A SALVADORAN TELEVISION NEWSCAST. HE SAID NO ONE KNEW EXACTLY WHO HAD PLANNED THE MURDER OF FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA AND THE OTHER JESUIT PRIESTS WHO WERE ASSASSINATED EARLY YESTERDAY MORNING. RADIO VENCEREMOS TELLS WILLIAM WALKER THAT HIS CYNICISM IS BEYOND THE LIMIT. WILLIAM WALKER KNOWS PERFECTLY WELL WHICH GENERAL STAFF OFFICE ISSUED THE ORDER TO ASSASSINATE THE JESUIT PRIESTS. WILLIAM WALKER KNOWS THAT ON THE NIGHT OF 11 NOVEMBER RADIO CUSCATLAN URGED THE PEOPLE TO ASSASSINATE IGNACIO ELLACURIA, RUBEN ZAMORA, AND DOCTOR GUILLERMO UNGO. THE WHOLE WORLD.... THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA HAS FEATURED THE RECORDING IN WHICH RADIO CUSCATLAN -- THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF'S RADIO, MEANING THE RADIO CONTROLLED BY THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF, THE RADIO IN WHICH NOT A SINGLE WORD, NOT A SINGLE COMMA GOES OUT WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE CENSORS WHICH HAVE BEEN IMPOSED ON RADIO CUSCATLAN - - DEATH. THEREFORE, WILLIAM WALKER KNOWS PERFECTLY WELL WHERE THE ORDER CAME FROM; HE KNOWS THE EXACT TIME THAT 40 UNIFORMED MEN LEFT IN CURFEW, A FEW BLOCKS FROM COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE'S OFFICE. WILLIAM WALKER'S CYNICISM WENT BEYOND THE LIMIT WHEN HE SAID THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW OR WHO PLANNED IGNACIO ELLACURIA'S ASSASSINATION. WILLIAM WALKER IS DOING A HISTORICAL IMITATION OF THE FILIBUSTER WHO CAME TO CENTRAL AMERICA IN 1856 TO SUBJUGATE OUR PEOPLE AND BECOME PRESIDENT OF A CENTRAL AMERICAN NATION, MEANING NICARAGUA, WHO DECREED THAT ENGLISH BE THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE, AND THAT THE U.S. FLAG BECOME THE OCCUPATION FORCES' FLAG. WILIAM WALKER IS RE- EDITING A SHAMEFUL CHAPTER IN CENTRAL AMERICA'S HISTORY. WILLIAM WALKER, THE U.S. AMBASSADOR IN OUR HOMELAND, IS RE-EDITING -- IN THE FORM OF A CARICATURE -- A HISTORICAL EVENT WHICH OCCURRED IN THE 19TH CENTURY. HOWEVER, WE WANT TO TELL SOMETHING TO THE NEW WILLIAM WALKER, WHO HAS BEEN FEATURED IN PRESS AND TELEVISION NEWS REPORTS GIVING FIGURES WHICH DIFFER EVEN FROM THOSE GIVEN BY COL PONCE; THE NEW WILLIAM WALKER, WHO THINKS HE IS PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND IS BETTER THAN CRISTIANI AND COL PONCE, SO HE GIVES INVENTED FIGURES ON GUERRILLA CASUALTIES; THE NEW WILLIAM WALKER, WHO EVALUATES THE NATION'S POLITICAL AND MILITARY SITUATION, EVEN BEFORE CRISTIANI AND PONCE DO SO, EVEN CONTRADICTING COL PONCE'S FIGURES. WILLIAM WALKER SAID 40 MEMBERS OF THE FMLN WERE CAPTURED, YET THE BLEARY-EYED COL PONCE LAST NIGHT TALKED ABOUT 9 FMLN MEMBERS. WHERE, THEN, ARE THE REST OF THE CAPTURED FMLN FIGHTERS? HUMANITARIAN GROUPS SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO THAT CONTRADICTION BETWEEN PRESIDENT WILLIAM WALKER AND HIS SUBORDINATE, COL PONCE. RED CROSS INTERNATIONAL, GREEN CROSS, AND AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL MUST DEMAND THAT WILLIAM WALKER SAY WHERE THE CAPTURED GUERRILLA FIGHTERS ARE, BECAUSE COL PONCE ONLY MENTIONS NINE FIGHTERS. COL PONCE TALKS ABOUT NINE AND THE OTHER ONE TALKS ABOUT DOZENS. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN PRESIDENT WILLIAM WALKER AND HIS SUBORDINATE, COL PONCE. WHERE ARE THE OTHER CAPTURED FIGHTERS? MOST OF THEM WERE SURELY CIVILIANS WHO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CONFLICT. THEY MUST HAVE BEEN CAUGHT IN THE WAR ZONES AND THEN PRESENTED TO THE MEDIA AS DEAD GUERRILLA FIGHTERS. WE DEMAND, BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THAT AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER CLEARLY SAY HOW COL PONCE COULD HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN WHEN ADMITTING THAT ONLY NINE GUERRILLA FIGHTERS WERE CAPTURED -- WHILE THE U.S. AMBASSADOR PERSONALLY REVEALED THE FIGURES THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN REVEALED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI A LONG TIME AGO -- EVEN IF THEY WERE IMAGINARY FIGURES. WILLIAM WALKER MUST ANSWER THIS QUESTION: WHERE ARE THE GUERRILLA FIGHTERS?
DEV-MUC3-0776	TOKYO , 16 NOV 89 -- COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS WILL PAY AN OFFICIAL WORKING VISIT TO JAPAN FROM DECEMBER 5-8, A FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN SAID THURSDAY. BARCO WILL BE THE FIRST COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT TO VISIT JAPAN. GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES ARE FORMULATING AN ECONOMIC AID PROGRAM FOR COLOMBIA, WHICH IS CURRENTLY FIGHTING AGAINST DRUG SYNDICATES, INFORMED SOURCES SAID. JAPAN EXTENDED A TOTAL OF 6.69 MILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC AID TO COLOMBIA LAST YEAR. THE COLOMBIAN LEADER IS SCHEDULED TO MEET EMPEROR AKIHITO, PRIME MINISTER TOSHIKI KAIFU AND FOREIGN MINISTER TARO NAKAYAMA. THE SOURCES ALSO SAID JAPANESE POLICE WILL PROVIDE TIGHT SECURITY FOR BARCO AGAINST POSSIBLE TERRORIST ATTACK DURING HIS FOUR-DAY STAY HERE. BARCO HAS BEEN WAGING AN ALL-OUT WAR WITH THE DRUG CARTELS SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE AS PRESIDENT IN 1986.
DEV-MUC3-0777	HAVANA , 17 NOV 89 -- FIGHTING CONTINUES TODAY IN SAN SALVADOR, AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE TRIUMPHALIST TONE OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY BEGINS TO CHANGE. AN AP CABLE WE RECEIVED THIS MORNING IN OUR NEWSROOM SAYS THE FOLLOWING: THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THEY HAVE SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN VARIOUS SUBURBS OF THIS CAPITAL. THIS IS WHAT THE AP CABLE SAYS TEXTUALLY IN ITS HEADLINE. IN ADDITION TO THIS SITUATION, THERE IS ANOTHER FACT IN THE BATTLEFIELD TO WHICH THE NEWS AGENCIES HAVE NOT PAID MUCH ATTENTION, WHICH IS ALSO A REFLECTION OF THE TYPE OF COMBAT THAT THE SALVADORAN FORCES ARE FIGHTING. AP ITSELF SAYS THE FOLLOWING: THE WAR BECAME DIRTY WITH THE MURDER OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO WOMEN BY UNIDENTIFIED TERRORISTS WHO ACTED DURING THE CURFEW. FURTHERMORE, THE CABLE SAYS THAT THE CANADIAN EMBASSY IN SAN SALVADOR REPORTED THAT 12 WORKERS FROM THE LUTHERAN CHURCH WERE ARRESTED BY UNIFORMED SECURITY INDIVIDUALS IN DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR. AT THE BEGINNING, THE CABLE SAID THAT THE SIX PRIESTS HAD BEEN MURDERED BY UNIDENTIFIED TERRORISTS. LATER, THEY ARE IDENTIFIED AS UNIFORMED INDIVIDUALS. AMONG THE PRIESTS MURDERED WAS FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA, RECTOR OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY AND DIRECTOR OF A MAGAZINE WHICH REFLECTED THE PEOPLES' THOUGHTS, NOT ONLY IN EL SALVADOR BUT ALSO IN THE REST OF CENTRAL AMERICA. NONE OF THESE PRIESTS BELONGED TO THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT . FURTHERMORE, ELLACURIA HIMSELF ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS EXPRESSED OPINIONS WHICH DID NOT CONCUR WITH THOSE OF THE FMLN. HOWEVER, HE FELT THAT A SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN PROBLEM COULD NOT EXCLUDE THE PEOPLE'S INCLUSION OF THE FMLN. THE ASSASSINS WHO ACTED UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE CURFEW ARE FROM THE SALVADORAN ARMY, THEY ARE NOT UNIDENTIFIED TERRORISTS, LIKE THE AP CABLE SAYS. THEY ARE ASSASSINS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY, THE SAME ARMY WHICH HAS ALL THE SUPPORT OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. IN THIS, WE CAN ALSO SEE THE DOUBLE STANDARD OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION. ON THE ONE HAND, ALL ITS PUBLICITY APPARATUS SAYS TO THE WORLD THAT WASHINGTON IS IN FAVOR OF DEMOCRACY AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. HOWEVER, IN PRACTICE, IT SUPPORTS THE ASSASSINS OF PRIESTS AND SUPPLIES BOMBS AND ROCKETS SO THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMY -- WHICH HAS PLANES AND HELICOPTERS PROVIDED BY THE UNITED STATES -- CAN BOMB THE SALVADORAN CIVILIAN POPULATION. THESE ARE THE FACTS. THIS IS THE TRUTH THAT YANKEE PROPAGANDA IS HIDING AND MANIPULATING.
DEV-MUC3-0778	CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 -- THIS MORNING, AND WITH A STUPID LOOK ON HIS FACE, U.S. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER ASKED WHO HAD KILLED FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA. HE SAID HE DID NOT KNOW WHO HAD DONE THIS. WELL THEN, MR WILLIAM WALKER, AND MONITORS AT THE U.S. EMBASSY, GOOD MORNING; RADIO VENCEREMOS GREETS YOU. WE ARE ASKING YOU TO TAKE DOWN WHAT WE ARE GOING TO SAY AND TAKE IT IMMEDIATELY TO WILLIAM WALKER'S OFFICE. GOOD MORNING U.S. EMBASSY MONITORS, TELL WILLIAM WALTER -- WE DO NOT KNOW IF HE IS FROM TENNESSEE LIKE THE OTHER FILIBUSTER -- THAT RADIO VENCEREMOS IS GIVING HIM A CLUE SO THAT HE CAN FIND OUT WHO KILLED FATHER ELLACURIA. TELL WILLIAM WALKLER TO FIND OUT WHO ARRESTED TWO PRIESTS AND SEVERAL MISSIONARIES, INCLUDING A U.S. CITIZEN THIS MORNING. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER, THIS MORNING YOU ASKED WHO HAD MURDERED FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA; RADIO VENCEREMOS WILL GIVE YOU A CLUE. FIND OUT WHO ORDERED THIS MORNING'S ARREST OF TWO PRIESTS. U.S. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER, IF YOU HAVE A DROP OF DECENCY LEFT IN YOU, SPEAK UP, SAY WHAT YOU KNOW. TELL US WHERE THE 40 MEN IN UNIFORM LEFT FROM. U.S. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER FROM TENNESSEE, THAT IS, IF YOU ARE FROM TENNESSEE LIKE THE OTHER FILIBUSTER -- RADIO VENCEREMOS IS GIVING YOU A CLUE SO THAT YOU WILL FIND AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION YOU CANDIDLY ASKED ON TELEVISION THIS MORNING. YOU SAID THAT YOU DID NOT KNOW WHO HAD ORDERED THE DEATH OF ONE OF THE MOST INTELLIGENT MEN IN EL SALVADOR, NOT BORN IN EL SALVADOR BUT MORE SALVADORAN THAN COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE. WE REPEAT, MR AMBASSADOR TO EL SALVADOR, THE FOLLOWING IS OUR CLUE: FIND OUT WHO ORDERED THE ARREST OF THE PRIESTS AND MISSIONARIES, INCLUDING A U.S. CITIZEN. FIND OUT IMMEDIATELY, AND YOU BETTER MOVE QUICKLY, OTHERWISE THEY COULD BE KILLED. THERE LIES YOUR ANSWER. ASK WHETHER THE TWO PRIESTS WERE ARRESTED BY THE FMLN OR THE ARMED FORCES. WE INSIST, IF THERE IS A SINGLE DROP OF DECENCY LEFT IN YOU, CHECK THE ELENA FUENTES STATEMENTS AGAINST THE CHURCH MONITORED A FEW DAYS AGO. MR AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER, IF THERE IS A SINGLE DROP OF DECENCY LEFT IN YOU, CHECK THE RECORDINGS THE U.S. EMBASSY HAS OF RADIO CUSCATLAN AND LISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA, MSGR RIVERA Y DAMAS, AND MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ ON THE NIGHT OF 11 NOVEMBER AND EARLIER. GENTLEMEN AT THE U.S. EMBASSY WHO ARE MONITORING US, HELP THE AMBASSADOR. GO TO YOUR FILES, FIND THE RADIO CUSCATLAN RECORDINGS AND TAKE THEM TO THE AMBASSADOR'S OFFICE. MONITORS AT THE EMBASSY, HELP THAT ABSENTMINDED AMBASSADOR. MONITORS AT THE EMBASSY, GIVE HIM A HAND; IT SEEM THAT THE AMBASSADOR'S MEMORY IS FAILING HIM. MONITORS, YOU WHO ARE SO EFFICIENT, WE ASK YOU TO HELP THE AMBASSADOR REGAIN HIS MEMORY. TAKE HIM COL ELENA FUENTE'S RECORDING ACCUSING THE CHURCH OF HAVING TIES WITH THE FMLN. TAKE HIM COL MONTANO'S STATEMENTS, TAKE HIM COL ZEPEDA'S STATEMENTS, TAKE HIM ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON'S STATEMENTS, ACCUSING FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA OF BEING THE DIRECTOR OF THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR. HELP US U.S. EMBASSY MONITORS BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT MR WILLIAM WALKER HAS A VERY SHORT MEMORY.
DEV-MUC3-0779	SAN SALVADOR, 17 NOV 89 -- ACCORDING TO REPORTS RECEIVED IN THIS NATIONAL RADIO-TELEVISION NETWORK, BRITISH NEWSMAN DAVID BLUNDY OF THE SUNDAY TIMES BECAME A VICTIM OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN, BULLETS. HE DIED A FEW MINUTES AGO AT ROSALES HOSPITAL. THE FMLN TERRORISTS DO NOT SATISFY THEIR INSTINCTS BY KILLING CIVILIANS AND THE UCA JESUITS, NOW THEY ARE AIMING THEIR CRIMINAL MACHINEGUNS AT JOURNALISTS. THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE, TOGETHER WITH THE GLORIOUS ARMED FORCES, REPEAT THEIR CALL TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO REPUDIATE THE FMLN ASSASSINS. THE CIVILIANS WHO GAVE BLUNDY FIRST AID HAVE TOLD US THAT THE NEWSMAN WAS HIT BY AN FMLN SNIPER WHEN HE WAS GREETING AN OFFICER OF OUR GLORIOUS ARMED FORCES IN MEJICANOS. THIS ACTION ONCE MORE CONFIRMS THE TREACHEROUS AND FLAGRANT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS OF THE FMLN ASSASSINS, WHO ARE BEING REPUDIATED BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.
DEV-MUC3-0780	CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 -- COMRADE VILLALOBOS REFERRED TO THE BOMBINGS AND THE KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS. THIS IS THE QUESTION HE WAS ASKED: IN THE PAST FEW HOURS, SEVERAL GOVERNMENTS AND HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS HAVE PRESSURED THE GOVERNMENT TO STOP THE BOMBINGS AND THE BLOODSHED IN OUR HOMELAND. HOWEVER, DESPITE THIS INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE, THE JESUIT PRIESTS WERE KILLED IN SAN SALVADOR. THEREFORE, WHAT IS THE INTENTION BEHIND THE BOMBINGS? WHAT INTENTION DID THE ARMED FORCES' GENERAL STAFF HAVE IN KILLING THE JESUITS? COMMANDER VILLALOBOS REPLIED: FIRST, IT MUST BE SAID THAT THE KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS BY THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT WAS A HARSH BLOW TO THE POSSIBILITIES FOR AN EFFECTIVE DEMOCRACY IN OUR COUNTRY. THE JESUIT PRIESTS ARE A SECTOR OF SALVADORAN SOCIETY THAT HAS MADE AND CONTINUES TO MAKE GREAT CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PEOPLE'S EDUCATION. THEY TAUGHT US HOW TO DEBATE, THE NEED TO REASON THINGS OUT, AND THE NEED TO HAVE POLITICAL PLURALISM. HOWEVER, IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, THE SECTORS, AND MR. CRISTIANI CANNOT STAND INTELLIGENT PEOPLE, THE DEBATES, THE ANALYSES, AND THE PEOPLE'S REASONING. THIS IS WHY THEY COMMITTED THIS CRIME. THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS CRIME BECOMES EVIDENT, NOT ONLY BASED ON DIRECT CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS THE FACT THAT IT WAS CARRIED OUT BY UNIFORMED MEN DURING THE CURFEW PERIOD AND THAT A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE CRIME A GROUP OF MILITARY MEN CHECKED OUT THE PLACE WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO COMMIT THE CRIME -- CLEARLY INTENDING TO PREPARE A PLAN -- BUT BECAUSE OF ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE JESUITS MADE OVER THE NATIONAL NETWORK. WE MUST ALSO BEAR IN MIND THAT THIS CRIME WAS A POLITICAL MISTAKE MADE BY THE DICTATORSHIP. IT WAS A MISCALCULATION ON THE PART OF THOSE WHO MADE THAT DECISION. WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO STOP THE FMLN. THEY COULD NOT STOP THE FMLN PLAN. ONCE WE BEGAN TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN A VERY CRITICAL SITUATION. WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS CRITICAL SITUATION, THEY TOOK THE WRONG STEP. THE DAY BEFORE THE CRIME THE ARMED FORCES BEGAN A STRATEGY TO WEAR OUT THE FMLN, LOGISTICALLY. WE MUST NOT IGNORE THE FACT THAT THE ARMED FORCES' CALCULATIONS WERE BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE FMLN FORCES WOULD BECOME EXHAUSTED. WE WOULD HAVE MADE A SERIOUS MISTAKE IF WE HAD BEGUN THIS PLAN WITHOUT FORESEEING ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. HOWEVER, THE ARMED FORCES BASED THEIR CALCULATIONS ON OUR POSSIBLE EXHAUSTION. CONSEQUENTLY, BASED ON THOSE CALCULATIONS, THEY FIGURED THAT THEY HAD 3 OR 4 DAYS TO LAUNCH A COUNTERATTACK. SO, THE DAY PRIOR TO THE KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THEY LAUNCHED SEVERAL OFFENSIVES -- I RATHER CALL THEM COUNTEROFFENSIVES -- TO TRY TO DISLODGE US FROM OUR POSITIONS. THEIR TACTIC WAS TO MAKE US WASTE AMMUNITION. THEY WERE NOT REALLY TRYING TO MAKE US ABANDON OUR POSITIONS YET. HOWEVER, OUR FIGHTERS, IN ADDITION TO SAVING OUR AMMUNITION, HAVE THE MATERIAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES SO THEY INFLICTED MANY CASUALTIES ON THE ARMED FORCES AND WORE THEM OUT. BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE ARMED FORCES DID NOT REALIZE THAT AND FELT THAT THEY COULD LAUNCH A BIG COUNTERATTACK TO ANNIHILATE THE FMLN FORCES. BASED ON THAT, THEY CAME UP WITH A PLAN THAT WAS NOT ONLY MILITARY BUT POLITICAL. THE U.S. AMBASSADOR, THE U.S. ADVISERS, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, AND WHO KNOWS WHO ELSE WERE INFORMED ABOUT THIS PLAN. THEY MADE THE WRONG INTERPRETATION OF THE CALLS MADE BY THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS AND OTHER HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS ON THE NEED TO HAVE A TRUCE TO EVACUATE CIVILIANS. THEY THOUGHT THAT WE MADE THESE CALLS AND BASED ON THAT, THEY FELT THAT THEY COULD PROCEED TO A COUNTEROFFENSIVE. BASED ON THAT, LET US ANALYZE THE PROPAGANDA AND INFORMATION DISSEMINATED ON THE DAY PRIOR TO THE KILLING OF THE JESUITS. THE U.S. AMBASSADOR HIMSELF EXPLAINED A WAR REPORT AND GAVE AN UPDATE ON THE SITUATION. THUS, THEY THOUGHT THAT THE FMLN WAS GOING TO SUFFER A GREAT POLITICAL AND MILITARY DEFEAT IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS. THEY HAD AN OVERALL PLAN.
DEV-MUC3-0781	CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 -- THE ARMY CARRIED OUT A LARGE BOMB ATTACK ON NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR IN AN EFFORT TO WEAKEN OUR POSITIONS. THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE A VICTORY THERE. BUT IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT, ASIDE FROM ALL THE PROPAGANDA THEY USED AND THE PLAN TO WEAKEN US MILITARILY, THE ARMED FORCES ATTACKED UNION OFFICES AND THE HOMES OF LEADERS OF POPULAR MOVEMENTS IN VARIOUS SECTORS. APPARENTLY, EVERYONE HAD GONE INTO HIDING AND THEY ONLY FOUND THE WIFE OF A UNIVERSITY LEADER AND THEY KILLED HER. THEY ALSO FOUND THE JESUITS. IT SEEMS THAT IN VIEW OF RECENT TALKS WITH CRISTIANI, FATHER ELLACURIA HAD BECOME VERY TRUSTING. HE THOUGHT THAT NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN TO THEM. THIS SITUATION SO THEY DID NOT PROTECT THEMSELVES IN THE FACE OF THE DANGER OF A POSSIBLE ACTION SUCH AS THIS CRIME. ON THE SAME NIGHT WHEN THE ENTIRE NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR AREA WAS BEING BOMBED, THE JESUITS WERE KILLED. WHAT WAS THEIR INTENTION? THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE TO OBTAIN A MILITARY VICTORY AND SET OUT TO CARRY OUT A WITCH HUNT. THEY SET OUT TO KILL ALL OPPOSITION MEMBERS THAT ONE NIGHT, WITH THE IDEA THAT THEY WERE GOING TO WIPE OUT THE FMLN, MILITARILY. BASED ON THAT ASSUMPTION, THEY DECIDED TO CARRY OUT THIS ACTION TO GUARANTEE FOR THEMSELVES A FEW MORE YEARS OF STABILITY THROUGH THE PEACE OF CEMETERIES, REGARDLESS OF THE CONSEQUENCES. WHAT REALLY HAPPENED? THE DAY AFTER THEY COMMITTED THE CRIME, THEY LAUNCHED THEIR OFFENSIVE TO ANNIHILATE THE FMLN. THEY THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE THEIR DECISIVE DAY, BUT THE OFFENSIVE FAILED. THEIR ATTACK WAS REPELLED, THEY SUSTAINED MANY CASUALTIES, AND LOSS MUCH MATERIEL. THEIR TROOPS WERE FURTHER BEATEN AND THEY DID NOT OBTAIN ANY EFFECTIVE MILITARY RESULTS. CONSEQUENTLY, THEIR COUNTEROFFENSIVE WAS REJECTED AND THE BLOW THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO DEAL TO THE LEADERS OF THE POPULAR MOVEMENT FAILED, ON THE ONE HAND BECAUSE SOME OF THESE LEADERS WERE HIDING AND ON THE OTHER BECAUSE THEY COMMITTED AN HORRENDOUS CRIME AND IT BACKFIRED. IT WAS A CRIME BY THE GENERAL STAFF AND MR. CRISTIANI KNEW ABOUT IT. CRISTIANI CLEARLY AND PROBABLY EVEN THE U.S. EMBASSY COULD BE INVOLVED IN THIS. THEY THOUGHT THAT BY KILLING ALL OPPOSITION MEMBERS, THEY WERE GOING TO ACHIEVE DEFINITE PEACE IN EL SALVADOR. THIS IS VERY CLEAR. BUT THIS ACTION BACKFIRED. IT WAS A PAINFUL INCIDENT, BUT IT IS AN INCIDENT THAT IS GOING TO BACKFIRE FOR THE GOVERNMENT. IT IS GOING TO RESULT IN GREAT ISOLATION FOR THE REGIME, AT A MOMENT WHEN THE FMLN IS STRONGER. AT A MOMENT WHEN THE FMLN HAS A POLITICAL, MILITARY, AND STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE. THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS IS SUICIDE FOR THE REGIME. I REALLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT. THEY MADE A VERY SERIOUS MISTAKE. IN ADDITION, THEY CONFIRMED A TRUTH WE HAVE BEEN MAINTAINING: THEY ARE FASCISTS AND ASSASSINS. THEY MUST LEAVE POWER. THEY HAVE CREATED A SITUATION IN WHICH THE POSSIBILITY FOR AN FMLN VICTORY IS GREAT. THEY HAVE CREATED A SITUATION IN WHICH THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE OLIGARCHIC SECTORS OF THE SALVADORAN SOCIETY WILL BE CAUSED BY THEIR OWN MISTAKES.
DEV-MUC3-0782	SAN SALVADOR, 17 NOV 89 -- THE SALVADORAN OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES AND THE PEOPLE'S ORGANIZATIONS TODAY PROPOSED THE CREATION OF A SALVATION JUNTA THAT WOULD INCLUDE THE ARMY AND THE FMLN , HUMBERTO CENTENO -- LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION NATIONAL UNION OF SALVADORAN WORKERS -- HAS ANNOUNCED. IN STATEMENTS TO IPS, CENTENO SAID THE FMLN HAS ALREADY SAID IT IS WILLING TO JOIN THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL LIFE, AND THAT IT IS WILLING TO BE A PART OF A SALVATION JUNTA AS A SOLUTION TO THE NATIONAL CRISIS. THE UNTS' PROPOSAL WAS SUPPORTED BY FIDEL CHAVEZ MENA, CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY NATIONAL SECRETARY AND PRESIDENT OF THE LATIN AMERICAN CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATION, IN STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS. CHAVEZ MENA, WHO WAS THE PDC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN THE PAST ELECTIONS, SAID THAT ONE OF THE WAYS TO SOLVE THE CIVIL WAR PROBLEM WOULD BE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO RECTIFY ITS STAND AND INITIATE NEW NEGOTIATIONS. WE SHOULD ALL SIT DOWN TO FIND A SOLUTION, HE TOLD NEWSMEN, ADDING THAT NEITHER SIDE WILL ACHIEVE A MILITARY VICTORY. MEANWHILE, CENTENO STATED THAT THE BOMBINGS IN DENSELY POPULATED AREAS AND THE MURDER OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS ARE FACTORS THAT ARE WEARING OUT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND. ACCORDING TO THE LABOR LEADER, NONE OF THE SOCIAL FORCES WITH ANY REPRESENTATIVE FORCE SUPPORT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND HIS GOVERNMENT. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NOT A GENERAL CONSENSUS, THE POLITICAL AND LABOR GROUPS HAVE SAID THEY ARE IN FAVOR OF A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION AND THE RESUMPTION OF A DIALOGUE WITH THE PRESENCE OF THE OAS AND THE UNITED NATIONS AS WELL AS THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AS GUARANTORS OF THE AGREEMENTS. HOWEVER, THE PETITION MIGHT NOT BE RECEIVED WELL BY A GOVERNMENT THAT IS APPARENTLY NOT WILLING TO NEGOTIATE A CEASE-FIRE WITH THE REBELS WHO CONTINUE OCCUPYING THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE NORTHERN AREA OF THE CAPITAL CITY.
DEV-MUC3-0783	GUATEMALA CITY, 17 NOV 89 -- THE CENTRAL AMERICAN, MEXICAN, AND PANAMANIAN EPISCOPAL CONFERENCES "CONDEMN" AND "REPUDIATE" THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR AND DEMAND THAT THE CONFLICTING PARTIES TO DECLARE "AN IMMEDIATE CEASE - FIRE." A COMMUNIQUE RELEASED IN GUATEMALA TODAY STATES THAT THE LATIN AMERICAN BISHOPS MET IN GUATEMALA ON 16 NOVEMBER TO DISCUSS "WITH DEEP PAIN AND ANGUISH THE BLOODY EPISODES OF A CIVIL WAR THAT ARE DESTROYING EL SALVADOR" AND TO EXPRESS "OUR SUFFERING AND CONCERN ABOUT THE EXTREME SITUATION THAT OUR SALVADORAN BROTHERS ARE EXPERIENCING." THE CELAM COMMUNIQUE STRESSES: "WE FEEL AN URGENT NEED TO JOIN OUR VOICE TO THOSE OF ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO REJECT VIOLENCE AS A METHOD FOR SOLVING PROBLEMS." THUS, "WE CONDEMN AND REPUDIATE THAT FRATRICIDAL WAR, WHICH IS THE BITTER RESULT OF THE SITUATION OF UNBEARABLE INJUSTICE THAT THE NOBLE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCED. THAT SITUATION HAS ALSO BEEN WORSENED BY THE REPROACHABLE INTERFERENCE OF HEGEMONIC POWERS WHO ARE SERVICING INTERESTS UNCONNECTED WITH OUR NATIONS." THE CENTRAL AMERICAN, MEXICAN, AND PANAMANIAN BISHOPS CALL ON ALL CHRISTIANS TO RAISE A SINGLE CRY IN DEMANDING THAT THE CONFLICTING PARTIES IMMEDIATLY DECLARE A CEASE - FIRE AND ESTABLISH A TRUCE. THE PRESIDENT AND DELEGATES OF THE AREA EPISCOPAL CONFERENCES ADD THAT THE CEASE - FIRE WOULD ALLOW "FIRST, THE EVACUATION OF WOUNDED PEOPLE AND THE BURYING OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED, AND IT WOULD ALSO HELP IN SEEKING A NATIONAL AND HUMAN WAY OUT TO THIS MERCILESS MASSACRE." THE DOCUMENT SAYS: "WE EXPRESS OUR PAIN OVER THE VIOLENT DEATH OF VARIOUS PRIESTS AND HUNDREDS OF CHRISTIANS AND WE HOPE THAT THEIR BLOOD WILL BE A SEED YIELDING TO A DAYBREAK OF PEACE, JUSTICE, AND LOVE." THE BISHOPS ADD THAT THEY ARE "TRULY" IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE SALVADORAN CHURCH, ITS FAITHFUL, AND CLERGYMEN "TO WHOM WE ARE LINKED THROUGH A DEEP FEELING OF FRATERNAL AFFECTION AND WHOSE FORCED ABSENCE IN THIS BISHOPS' MEETING WE HAVE DEEPLY REGRETTED." THE DOCUMENT IS SIGNED BY MSGR DIMAS CEDENO DELGADO, PRESIDENT OF THE PANAMANIAN EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE AND SANTIAGO, VERAGUAS PROVINCE BISHOP; MSGR ROMAN ARRIETA VILLALOBOS, SAN JOSE BISHOP AND PRESIDENT OF THE COSTA RICAN EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE; MSGR SALVADOR SCHLAFFER, BLUEFIELDS BISHOP AND PRESIDENT OF THE NICARAGUAN EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE; MSGR HECTOR SANTOS HERNANDEZ, ARCHBISHOP OF TEGUCIGALPA AND PRESIDENT OF THE HONDURAN EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE. IN ADDITION, THE COMMUNIQUE IS SIGNED BY MSGR JUAN JESUS POSADAS OCAMPO, GUADALAJARA ARCHBISHOP AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE MEXICAN EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE; MSGR RODOLFO QUEZADA TORUNO, ZACAPA BISHOP AND PRESIDENT OF THE GUATEMALAN EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE, AND BY MSGR OSCAR ANDRES RODRIGUEZ, TEGUCIGALPA AUXILIARY BISHOP AND CELAM SECRETARY GENERAL.
DEV-MUC3-0784	CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 -- WE CONDEMN GUATEMALAN INTERFERENCE IN EL SALVADOR. THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY GENERAL COMMAND EXPRESSES ITS PROFOUND SOLIDARITY AND ADMIRATION FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THEIR VANGUARD FORCES, THE FMLN , WHO WITH GREAT HEROISM AND DETERMINATION, ARE WRITING ONE OF THE MOST GLORIOUS PAGES IN SALVADORAN HISTORY. WITH DEEP INDIGNATION, WE HAVE SEEN HOW THE MEMBERS OF LA TANDONA, AND THE ARENA GOVERNMENT HEADED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HAVE DECIDED TO CONDUCT AND MAINTAIN MASSIVE BOMBINGS AGAINST THE DEFENSELESS CIVILIAN POPULATION, THUS SOWING DEATH, SLAUGHTERING, AND DESTROYING, IN VIEW OF THEIR INABILITY TO DEFEAT, DISLODGE, OR CONTAIN THE HEROIC FMLN FIGHTERS. CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AND THE SALVADORAN ARMY HAVE LOST CONTROL OVER THEIR ACTIONS BECAUSE OF THEIR DESPERATION OVER THE FMLN'S VICTORIOUS ADVANCE. THE FMLN FORCES HAVE NOT ONLY MAINTAINED THEIR POSITIONS, BUT HAVE ALSO INCREASED THEM IN SAN SALVADOR AND THROUGHOUT THE REMAINING SALVADORAN TERRITORY. ACTING OUT OF REVENGE, CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AND THE SALVADORAN ARMY BEGAN A SERIES OF CRIMINAL ACTIONS AIMED AT ALL THOSE WHO HAVE IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES WITH THE FAIR CAUSES OF THE SALVADORAN MAJORITY. AS A RESULT, EARLY ON THE MORNING OF 16 NOVEMBER, SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO HUMBLE WOMEN WHO WORKED WITH THEM WERE BRUTALLY MURDERED. WE SHARE THE ENORMOUS PAIN OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THAT OF THE JESUIT COMMUNITIES. WE ADD OUR PROTEST TO THE VOICES OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE PROTESTED AGAINST SUCH A VILE MURDER. THE URNG GENERAL COMMAND VIGOROUSLY CONDEMNS THOSE ACTIONS AND CALLS ON THE GUATEMALAN PEOPLE AND ON ALL POLITICAL, SOCIAL, DEMOCRATIC, AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES AGAINST THOSE BARBARIC AND GENOCIDAL ACTIONS, WHICH CAN ONLY BE COMPARED TO THE ACTIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE UNITED STATES IN VIETNAM AND THE NAZIS DURING WORLD WAR II. IN OUR STATEMENT ISSUED ON 13 NOVEMBER, WE REPORTED THE INTERVENTIONIST PLANS OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMY AGAINST OUR FRATERNAL NATION, EL SALVADOR. ACCORDING TO REPORTS RELEASED BY PRESS AGENCIES ON 15 NOVEMBER, 126 GUATEMALAN ARMY MEN BELONGING TO SPECIAL TROOPS CALLED SAIBILES, WHO CHARACTERIZED THEMSELVES FOR THEIR PATHOLOGIC SAVAGERY, WERE DEPLOYED. PRESIDENT CEREZO, THE CHIEF OF THE GUATEMALAN GENERAL STAFF, AND THE GUATEMALAN ARMY OFFICIAL SPOKESMAN HAVE ALREADY PUBLICLY EXPRESSED THEIR SOLIDARITY AND SUPPORT FOR CRISTIANI. WE VIGOROUSLY CONDEMN THE INTERFERENCE OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMY AGAINST THE GLORIOUS SALVADORAN PEOPLE. WE CALL ON ALL GUATEMALAN GROUPS TO PROTEST THAT INTERFERENCE. WE WILL MAKE THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMY PAY A VERY HIGH PRICE FOR THIS AGGRESSION AGAINST THE FRATERNAL SALVADORAN PEOPLE. WE WARN THE WORLD THAT A GENOCIDE LARGER THAN THE ONE WHICH HAS ALREADY OCCURRED IS BEING CONDUCTED IN EL SALVADOR NOW. WE ARE SURE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL DEFEAT ALL THEIR ENEMIES; THAT THEY WILL BE THE WINNERS OF THIS HISTORIC STRUGGLE, AND THAT THEY WILL ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS. THE BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED WILL TURN INTO NEW LIFE. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS OF FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY, AND PEACE. GUATEMALA, 17 NOVEMBER 1989 URNG GENERAL COMMAND COMMANDER ROLANDO MORAN COMMANDER GASPAR ILOM COMMANDER PABLO MONSANTO CARLOS GONZALEZ, PGT SECRETARY GENERAL
DEV-MUC3-0785	MADRID , 18 NOV 89 -- THE SPANISH DIPLOMATIC DELEGATION THAT WILL ATTEND THE FUNERALS OF THE JESUITS WHO WERE KILLED IN SAN SALVADOR ON 16 NOVEMBER LEFT FOR EL SALVADOR AT 0305 LOCAL TIME ABOARD A "BOEING 707" OF THE SPANISH AIR FORCE. INOCENCIO ARIAS, UNDER SECRETARY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, AND YAGO PICO DE COANA, GENERAL DIRECTOR FOR LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS, ARE THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES WHO WILL ATTEND THE FUNERALS OF THE JESUITS WHO WERE KILLED ON 16 NOVEMBER, FIVE OF WHOM WERE OF SPANISH ORIGIN. THREE MEMBERS OF THE SPECIAL OPERATIONS GROUPS ARE TRAVELING ON THE SAME PLANE TO GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF THE SPANISH EMBASSY IN SAN SALVADOR AND, IN CASE IT IS NECESSARY, THE SAME PLANE WILL EVACUATE SPANISH CITIZENS WISHING TO LEAVE EL SALVADOR.
DEV-MUC3-0786	SAN SALVADOR, 17 NOV 89 -- SALVADORAN PEOPLE: WE HAVE POWERFUL REASONS FOR ENSURING THAT JUSTICE WILL BE SERVED IN THIS REGRETTABLE INCIDENT IN WHICH FATHER ELLACURIA, OTHER PRIESTS, AND CIVILIANS WERE KILLED. WE WANT TO TELL THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO DRAW PREMATURE CONCLUSIONS TO ABSTAIN FROM DOING SO; WE URGE YOU TO HEED THE COMMUNITY OF JESUS AND THE ARCHBISHOPRIC OF SAN SALVADOR'S CALLS THAT THIS CASE NOT BE POLITICIZED OR USED TO GENERATE FURTHER VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY. WE BELIEVE THAT AN INVESTIGATION MUST BE CONDUCTED; WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONDUCTING AN IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION TO PUNISH THE PERPETRATORS OF THIS SAVAGE ACTION REGARDLESS OF WHO IS INVOLVED. THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC WILL REQUEST HELP TO ENSURE THAT THE SALVADORAN CRIME INVESTIGATION COMMISSION WILL BE ADVISED BY EXPERTS IN ORDER TO GET TO THE ROOT OF THIS REGRETTABLE INCIDENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WE WILL ASK THE UNITED STATES, GREAT BRITAIN, AND SPAIN TO HELP US. I MENTION SPAIN BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE WHO WERE ASSASSINATED ARE CITIZENS OF THAT COUNTRY. SALVADORAN PEOPLE: WE BELIEVE THAT THE TIME HAS COME TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION AND ENSURE THAT JUSTICE IS SERVED IN REPREHENSIBLE ACTIONS LIKE THIS ONE INSTEAD OF POLITICIZING THEM AND GENERATING FURTHER VIOLENCE. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND THE ARMED FORCES WILL NEVER ALLOW A RETURN TO THE PAST; A RETURN TO THOSE DRAMATIC AND REGRETTABLE TIMES IN THE COUNTRY WHEN GROUPS WANTED TO FUTHER THEIR CAUSE THROUGH VIOLENT ACTS SUCH AS THIS ONE. WE WILL NOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN AND WILL PURSUE SUCH GROUPS TO ENSURE THAT THEY FEEL THE FULL FORCE OF THE LAW.
DEV-MUC3-0787	CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 -- ON THE 7TH DAY OF THE OFFENSIVE, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT HAS TAKEN A STRATEGIC TURN IN THE WAR, AS WE BEGIN TO STRUGGLE FOR POWER IN A NEW AND DEFINITE SCENARIO OF OPERATIONS IN THE CITIES, WITH THE INSURRECTIONAL PARTICIPATION OF THE PEOPLE SEEKING TO ACHIEVE PEACE AND DEMOCRACY. THE FIGHTING WAGED IN SAN SALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL, USULUTAN, ZACATECOLUCA, SANTA ANA, AND OTHER PARTS IN THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE THANKS TO THE LEADING ROLE PLAYED BY THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUPPORTED AND JOINED THE STRUGGLE. THE 7 DAYS OF OUR OFFENSIVE HAVE EXPOSED THE MILITARY FASCIST DICTATORSHIP TO THE EYES OF THE WORLD. THE DICTATORSHIP HAS REMOVED ITS CIVILIAN MASK, AND IT HAS SHOWN ITS BARBARIC NATURE AS IT BOMBED CITIES AND MURDERED JESUIT PRIESTS, WHO WERE MEMBERS OF A NATIONAL CONSCIENCE THAT IS SEEKING SOCIAL CHANGES AND PEACE IN EL SALVADOR. THESE CRIMES COMMITTED BY CRISTIANI AND COLONEL PONCE DEFINITELY ISOLATE THEM FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD, WHICH CONDEMNS THEM AND RECALLS THE LAST DAYS OF SOMOZA. IN THE MEANTIME, THE U.S. CONGRESS DISCUSSES CUTTING MILITARY AID TO THE REGIME. THE 7 DAYS OF OUR OFFENSIVE HAVE LED TO IRREVERSIBLE ACHIEVEMENTS. THE REGIME HAS BEEN DEFEATED IN THE POLITICAL FIELD AND FATALY WOUNDED IN THE MILITARY FIELD. IN 7 DAYS OF COMBAT IN THE CAPITAL CITY, THE HIGH COMMAND LOST ITS LAST DEFENSIVE LINE. OUR FORCES ARE HITTING HARD AT THEIR TIRED HEART. VICTORY IS A FACT THAT NO ONE CAN ALTER. IN THE OFFENSIVE, WE KILLED OR WOUNDED AN ESTIMATED 827 TROOPS AND OFFICERS. WE SEIZED 127 LONG WEAPONS, 21 MACHINEGUNS AND SUPPORT WEAPONS, AS WELL AS ABOUT 80,000 ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION OF VARIOUS CALIBERS. WE HAVE CONFIRMED REPORTS THAT WE HAVE DAMAGED 11 AIRCRAFT AND DESTROYED 27 ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS. THE HUMILIATING DEFEAT OF THE HIGH COMMAND IS EVIDENT IN A DEPRESSED COL PONCE, WHO NO LONGER SPEAKS OF THE GUERRILLAS IN POCKETS ALONG THE BORDER. INSTEAD, HE SPEAKS IN FRONT OF A MAP OF THE CAPITAL CITY, POINTING OUT THE PRESENCE AND ADVANCE OF THE FMLN. VARIOUS POLITICAL AND SOCIAL GROUPS OF EL SALVADOR HAVE INITIATED EFFORTS ON THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL TO ACHIEVE A CONSENSUS IN ORDER TO FORM A NEW GOVERNMENT THAT WILL PUT AN END TO THE WAR AND BRING ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF THE COUNTRY. THE FMLN LOOKS FAVORABLY ON THESE EFFORTS, AND IT HAS ALREADY ACTIVELY JOINED THESE NATIONAL SECTORS WHO ARE OPPOSED TO THE GENOCIDE BEING CARRIED OUT BY THE HIGH COMMAND IN A SUICIDAL ATTEMPT TO PRESERVE THE WAR THAT IT HAS TURNED INTO A BUSINESS DEAL. THE GENERAL COMMAND RECOGNIZES THE HEROISM OF OUR FIGHTERS AND CALLS ON THEM TO CONTINUE ADVANCING ALONG WITH OUR REBELS IN THE FINAL CHAPTER OF THIS HISTORY. THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND, 17 NOVEMBER 1989
DEV-MUC3-0788	PANAMA CITY , 17 NOV 89 -- PRD COMMUNIQUE: TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE LATIN AMERICAN CHURCH MET IN MEDELLIN AND DECIDED TO WORK FOR THE NEEDY, DEATH SQUADS IN EL SALVADOR HAVE MURDERED IGNACIO ELLACURIA, A PRIEST, TEACHER, AND A SOCIAL FIGHTER, ALONG WITH SEVEN OTHER PRIESTS AND FAITHFUL. A WAR THAT BEGAN WITH THE MARTYRDOM OF ARCHBISHOP OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO IS NOW TAKING THE LIVES OF HUNDREDS OF VICTIMS WHO ARE KILLED IN INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS AND ATTACKS ON THE POPULATION. THE CRIME COMMITTED TODAY WAS SPONSORED BY THE SAME ONES WHO ARE NOW PLANNING GENERAL MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA'S MURDER. THERE IS ONLY A DIFFERENCE OF TIME AND PLACE. INSTEAD OF BOMBING DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS, THESE PEOPLE ARE RESORTING TO ATTACKS ON CERTAIN FIGURES AND LEADERS. BECAUSE OF THE ENORMOUS SIZE OF THE LATIN AMERICAN CRISIS, IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE CHURCH CANNOT ESCAPE THE DEMAND THAT MODERN TIMES IMPOSE ON ALL GROUPS OF DECIDING WHETHER TO BE ON THE SIDE OF PATRIOTIC AND LIBERTARIAN CAUSES OR TO BECOME ACCOMPLICES OF LOCAL AND FOREIGN OPPRESSORS. LIKE MSGR ROMERO, FATHER ELLACURIA AND HIS COMPANIONS IN MARTYRDOM REPRESENT THE CHURCH THAT IS BORN FROM THE HOMELAND AND THAT STRUGGLES ALONG WITH THE PEOPLE. PANAMANIAN GENERAL OMAR TORRIJOS ALSO DECIDED TO WORK ALONG WITH THE PEOPLE FROM INSIDE THE ARMED FORCES. THESE MARTYRS DESERVE THE SAME SOLIDARITY THEY GAVE TO THE LATIN AMERICAN CAUSE OF NATIONAL LIBERATION, BECAUSE THEY CHALLENGED THE OLIGARCHY, IMPERIALISM, AND EVEN THE REACTIONARY GROUPS OF THEIR OWN CHURCH. NOW, WHEN ALL THE WEIGHT OF THE LATIN AMERICAN CRISIS AND FOREIGN AGGRESSION FALLS UPON THE SALVADORAN AND PANAMANIAN PEOPLES; NOW THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE MASSIVELY REPRESSED; AND NOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT IN WASHINGTON ORDERS THE CIA TO ATTACK GEN NORIEGA, THOSE WHO STRUGGLE IN EL SALVADOR AND THOSE WHO PATRIOTICALLY RESIST ARE IN FACT DOING SO FOR ALL OF LATIN AMERICA. THUS, IGNACIO ELLACURIA'S AND HIS PARTNERS' SACRIFICE, AS WELL AS THE PREVIOUS SACRIFICE OF MSGR ROMERO AND THAT OF GEN NORIEGA, WILL BEAR FRUITS OF LIBERATION, JUSTICE, AND SOVEREIGNTY. THESE FRUITS WILL BE PLENTIFUL AND MORE DELICIOUS IF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN NEXT TO AND LEARNED FROM THESE PEOPLE CONTINUE STRUGGLING WITH THEIR EXAMPLE IN MIND. THE SACRIFICE THEY HAVE MADE FOR ALL OF US DESERVES PRAISE AND SOLIDARITY. WE OFFER THEM THAT PRAISE AND SOLIDARITY BY REAFFIRMING OUR COMMITMENT TO WORK AND STRUGGLE FOR THE DEFINITIVE LIBERATION OF OUR OWN PEOPLE. CARLOS DUQUE, PRESIDENT NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONARY PARTY PANAMA, 16 NOVEMBER 1989
DEV-MUC3-0789	SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE -- AND SO, TODAY WE RECEIVED A RESOLUTION FROM THE GUATEMALAN CONGRESS, WHERE THE GUATEMALAN CHRISTIAN DEMOCRACY, UCN , AND THE MLN , IN SUM, ALL THE POLITICAL FORCES JOINED IN CONDEMNING VIOLENCE AND THE FMLN, AND SUPPORTING OUR COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONALITY WHICH IS WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT. SALVADORAN BROTHERS, THIS SUPPORT MUST SERVE TO MOTIVATE US TO CREATE A UNITED FRONT, REJECT THE FMLN'S TERRORIST VIOLENCE, AND SEEK THE PEACE OUR COUNTRY WANTS AND NEEDS. SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE ARE SURE THIS WILL BE OVER SOON. IN TIMES LIKE THESE, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS REACTED IN A POSITIVE MANNER. SOLIDARITY EXISTS AMONG ALL SALVADORANS TO SEEK AND HELP THE NEEDIEST. THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS READY TO DO EVERYTHING WITHIN ITS POWER TO ACHIEVE TOTAL NORMALIZATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. IN ADDITION, IT IS JUST TO RECOGNIZE THE MILITARY CHIEFS AND OFFICERS AND, ESPECIALLY, THE SOLDIERS WHO HAVE BEEN DEFENDING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE FOR MANY DAYS, TRYING TO OUST THE FMLN HORDES FROM SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER CITIES WHERE THEY SOUGHT TO SOW TERROR. WE BELIEVE THAT THOSE MILITARY CHIEFS AND OFFICERS MUST FEEL THE SUPPORT FROM ALL THE PEOPLE AND, PRIMARILY, OUR RECOGNITION OF THEIR BRAVERY AND TOTAL DEDICATION TO THEIR FATHERLAND AND PEOPLE, WHO ARE NOW SEEKING PEACE AND CALM. AS FOR US, MILITARY CHIEFS, OFFICERS, SOLDIERS: OUR HIGHEST RECOGNITION AND GRATITUDE. HISTORY WILL REWARD YOU AND SAY THE GLORIOUS ARMED FORCES AND THEIR UNITS FOUND THE ROAD FOR ERADICATING VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY. SALVADORAN PEOPLE, THROUGH THE NATIONAL RADIO NETWORK AND DIFFERENT LOCAL NEWS MEDIA, YOU HAVE LEARNED WHAT IS HAPPENING. WE WILL BE GIVING YOU THE INFORMATION YOU NEED. WE ALSO WANT TO ASK YOU TODAY, JUST AS YOU SAW ALMOST TOTAL NORMALCY -- BUSES ON THE STREETS, PEOPLE GOING TO WORK -- TO CONTINUE DOING YOUR PART SO THAT TRANQUILLITY WILL PREVAIL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. TO ALL, THANK YOU. MAY GOD BLESS YOU.
DEV-MUC3-0790	SAN SALVADOR, 17 NOV 89 -- CAPTAIN VELASQUEZ, FROM THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE COMMAND AT USULUTAN, REPORTS TO THE RESIDENTS OF THE SANTA CLARA, SAN RAFAEL, ALTAMIRA, GUEVARA, FLORIDA, AND PERALTA NEIGHBORHOODS -- WHO HAVE BEEN DISPLACED FROM THEIR HOMES BY THE TERRORIST CRIMINALS -- THAT THEY MAY RETURN TO THEIR HOMES ON 18 NOVEMBER, BECAUSE THE TERRORIST CRIMINALS HAVE BEEN DISLODGED FROM THEIR POSITIONS. THE BRIGADE COMMAND ALSO REPORTS THAT THE SITUATION IN USULUTAN IS 80-PERCENT NORMAL. AT THE SAME TIME, WE WISH TO RECOGNIZE THE EFFORTS MADE BY THE ATONAL, OROMONTIQUE, JUCUARAN, AND LENCA BATTALIONS AS WELL AS THE SECURITY CORPS, WHO HAVE DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB IN THESE PAST 5 DAYS OF COMBAT.
DEV-MUC3-0791	SAN SALVADOR, 17 NOV 89 -- ...HAVE CONTROLLED THE TERRORIST ACTIONS OF THE FMLN . ON 17 NOVEMBER, THE ARMED FORCES MADE GREAT ADVANCES, AND WE CAN NOW SAY THAT THE AREA OF ZACAMIL HAS BEEN TOTALLY RECOVERED. THE CIVILIAN RESIDENTS OF THAT SECTOR HAVE SUFFERED VERY MUCH. LIKEWISE, THE ARMED FORCES CONTROL OTHER AREAS IN MEJICANOS MUNICIPALITY. THERE ARE ONLY SOME SMALL POCKETS IN CIUDAD DELGADO AND SOME SECTORS OF SOYAPANGO MUNICIPALITY WHERE THERE ARE STILL SOME CLASHES. SALVADORAN PEOPLE, IT IS REGRETTABLE THAT THE FMLN INSISTS ON CONTINUING WITH THESE DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS THAT MAKE INNOCENT PEOPLE, WHO ONLY WANT TO BE WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND LIVE IN PEACE, GO THROUGH SOME TRULY DRAMATIC MOMENTS. HOWEVER, WE MUST HAVE FULL CONFIDENCE THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE GOING TO DEFINITELY CONTROL ALL OF THESE FMLN TERRORISTS. THAT IS THE SCOPE OF THE ARMED FORCES ADVANCE, SALVADORAN PEOPLE. WE TRUST THAT EACH DAY WE WILL CONTINUE ADVANCING UNTIL WE HAVE FULL CONTROL, IN THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIME POSSIBLE, ALWAYS RESPECTING THE LIVES OF THOSE CIVILIANS IN DANGER. IN A COWARDLY MANNER, THE FMLN HIDES BEHIND THESE INNOCENT CIVILIANS AND USES THEM AS SHIELDS. WE ALSO WANT TO TELL YOU, SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN FORCED IN ANY MANNER TO ABANDON THEIR HOMES THAT, THROUGH THE EMERGENCY COMMISSION, THE GOVERNMENT IS OFFERING BASIC SERVICES, AS BEST IT CAN, TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TEMPORARILY DISPLACED FROM THEIR HOMES. WE BELIEVE THAT WITH THE HELP OF ALL THE FRIENDLY COUNTRIES WHO ARE ALREADY BEGINNING TO HELP AND SEND AID, FOR EXAMPLE, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN TOLD THAT TOMORROW THE KING OF SPAIN IS SENDING A PLANE LOADED WITH MEDICATION. ANOTHER PLANE IS BRINGING 55,000 TONS OF MEDICATIONS FROM THE ORDER OF MALTA. THE SALVADORAN-AMERICAN FOUNDATION IS SENDING A VERY GENEROUS DONATION OF 200 FIELD TENTS TO BE USED TO PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR MANY FAMILIES FROM THE INCLEMENCY OF THE WEATHER. THERE IS ALSO THE ROTARY CLUB, AND THERE IS EVEN A COMMUNITY IN THE UNITED STATES CALLED COOPERATION CALIFORNIA THAT IS SENDING 3,000 TONS OF CORN. SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AS YOU HAVE OBSERVED, AID IS ON ITS WAY. WE WANT TO TELL THOSE WHO ARE IN SUCH SITUATIONS, IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, TO REMAIN CALM, TO LISTEN TO THE INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE CONTINUOUSLY BEING GIVEN OVER THE NATIONAL RADIO NETWORK, AND TO COOPERATE AND HELP SO THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF FOOD AND MEDICATIONS CAN BE DONE IN THE BEST ORDERLY MANNER. WE FEEL THAT WHAT THE COUNTRY HAD IN STORAGE AND WHAT THESE GENEROUS COUNTRIES AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE DONATING WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ATTEND TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING MOMENTARILY AFFECTED. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC IS ALSO MAKING EFFORTS TO HAVE A RECONSTRUCTION FUND. WE KNOW THAT MANY HOMES HAVE BEEN DAMAGED. THE TERRORISTS HAVE OPENED HUGE HOLES IN ORDER TO MOVE IN BETWEEN THESE HOUSES. THIS COWARDLY ATTACK BY THE FMLN HAS BROUGHT ABOUT MUCH DESTRUCTION. ONCE THE SITUATION HAS BEEN NORMALIZED, WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SO THAT YOU CAN REBUILD YOUR HOMES AND RETURN TO NORMALCY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
DEV-MUC3-0792	SAN SALVADOR, 17 NOV 89 -- AND SO, TODAY WE RECEIVED A RESOLUTION FROM THE GUATEMALAN CONGRESS, WHERE THE GUATEMALAN CHRISTIAN DEMOCRACY, UCN , AND THE MLN , IN SUM, ALL THE POLITICAL FORCES JOINED IN CONDEMNING VIOLENCE AND THE FMLN, AND SUPPORTING OUR COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONALITY WHICH IS WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT. SALVADORAN BROTHERS, THIS SUPPORT MUST SERVE TO MOTIVATE US TO CREATE A UNITED FRONT, REJECT THE FMLN'S TERRORIST VIOLENCE, AND SEEK THE PEACE OUR COUNTRY WANTS AND NEEDS. SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE ARE SURE THIS WILL BE OVER SOON. IN TIMES LIKE THESE, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS REACTED IN A POSITIVE MANNER.

DEV-MUC3-0793	HAVANA , 17 NOV 89 -- FERNANDO CASTRO, DELEGATE OF THE GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT IN HAVANA CITY, MADE HERE TODAY AN URGENT CALL TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO PUT AN END TO THE GENOCIDE AND TO THE ESCALATION OF REPRESSION BY THE SALVADORAN REGIME. THE FMLN DELEGATE URGED INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION, INSTITUTIONS, GOVERNMENTS AND PEOPLES TO TAKE POSITIONS TO PUT AN END TO THE BARBARIC ACTIONS OF THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION. HE CHARGED THAT U.S. PILOTS TOOK PART IN INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS AND MACHINEGUNNING PERPETRATED AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. HE ALSO DENOUNCED THE INTERVENTION OF THE GUATEMALAN ELITE TROOPS KNOWN AS KAIBILES, WHO WERE TRAINED BY ISRAELI OFFICERS, AND OF HONDURAN TROOPS. IN A STATEMENT, AFRO-ASIAN-LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLE'S SOLIDARITY ORGANIZATION WARNED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ABOUT U.S. MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AND THE MOVEMENT OF U.S. TROOPS IN CENTRAL AMERICA.
DEV-MUC3-0794	SAN SALVADOR, 18 NOV 89 -- A SPANISH DIPLOMATIC DELEGATION LED BY INOCENCIO ARIAS, UNDER SECRETARY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, ARRIVED TODAY IN EL SALVADOR TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND TO ATTEMPT TO EVACUATE THE SPANIARDS THREATENED BY THE VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY. "WE HAVE COME TO STATE THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT'S INTEREST THAT THE JESUITS' CRIME BE SOLVED," ARIAS STATED AT COMALAPA AIRPORT, WHERE HE ARRIVED TODAY AT 1415 GMT. SIX JESUITS, FIVE OF THEM OF SPANISH BACKGROUND, WERE ASSASSINATED ON 16 NOVEMBER BY MEN WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS. THE HIGH- RANKING SPANISH FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIAL ALSO ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION OF "EVACUATING THOSE SPANIARDS WHO WISH TO LEAVE," APPROXIMATELY 20, ACCORDING TO A REPORT FROM THE SPANISH EMBASSY IN SAN SALVADOR. THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL AND OTHER CITIES IN THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN THE SITES OF FIERCE CLASHES AND BOMBINGS SINCE THE GUERRILLA GROUPS' MILITARY OFFENSIVE BEGAN A WEEK AGO. THE ARMY HAS PRACTICALLY CONTROLLED THE SITUATION IN THE CAPITAL IN RECENT HOURS, BUT CLASHES CONTINUE IN THE OUTSKIRTS.
DEV-MUC3-0795	BRASILIA , 18 NOV 89 -- IN A NOTE RELEASED BY THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT STATES ITS INDIGNATION OVER THE NEWS ABOUT THE MURDER OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS IN EL SALVADOR. THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT'S MESSAGE APPEALS TO THE PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT TO PROMPTLY RESUME NEGOTIATIONS FOLLOWING THE OAS SUGGESTIONS REGARDING THE SEARCH FOR PEACE.
DEV-MUC3-0796	MANAGUA , 18 NOV 89 -- ...GOVERNMENT AGAINST OUR EMBASSY WORSENED. THIS CAMPAIGN WAS INITIATED AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT. ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS OVER THE PAST 8 DAYS, TELEVISION, PRESS, AND RADIO HAVE SYSTEMATICALLY BROADCAST STATEMENTS BY EL SALVADOR'S TOP MILITARY AND POLITICAL AUTHORITIES, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI, VICE PRESIDENT MERINO, AND THE HEAD OF ARENA , ETC, BLAMING NICARAGUA FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING IN EL SALVADOR. THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN SYSTEMATIC AND IT HAS ENCOURAGED TERRORIST GROUPS TO THREATEN THE LIVES AND SAFETY OF NICARAGUA'S DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATIVES. OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, I HAVE RECEIVED MANY DEATH THREATS FROM EXTREMIST SECTORS AND, I REPEAT, THIS LED THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT TO THE DECISION TO EVACUATE US. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES ARE BROKEN. IT IS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE TO ENSURE THE ENTIRE MISSION'S PHYSICAL SAFETY. WE REQUESTED DIPLOMATIC PROTECTION FROM THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT AND RECEIVED A POSITIVE RESPONSE. WE WENT TODAY FROM THE RESIDENCE OF THE MEXICAN AMBASSADOR IN EL SALVADOR TO THE AIRPORT, AND FROM THERE TO MANAGUA. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, I WILL BE GLAD TO ANSWER THEM. A QUESTION FROM RADIO SANDINO. FIRST OF ALL, SINCE YOU GOT A FIRST- HAND VIEW, WHAT IS THE CURRENT SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR; SECOND, IS THIS A PROVISIONAL MEASURE OR WILL IT BE EXTENDED; HOW LONG WILL THIS MEASURE LAST? I CANNOT SAY HOW LONG IT WILL LAST. THAT IS UP TO THE GOVERNMENT, AND IT WILL DEPEND ON THE INTERNAL SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY. REGARDING YOUR FIRST QUESTION, THE SITUATION IS DIFFICULT. ON A MILITARY LEVEL, THE WAR CONTINUES; THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF MISINFORMATION BY THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND MANY INTERNATIONAL NEWS AGENCIES. THE TRUTH IS THAT THE BATTLE CONTINUES, THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE PHYSICAL DESTRUCTION IN MANY TOWNS AND NEIGHBORHOODS ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR. YOU KNOW WHICH TOWNS ARE INCLUDED: ZACAMIL, CIUDAD DELGADO, SOYAPANGO, ETC. THIS IS THE RESULT OF THE INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS BY THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE. THERE IS A REPORT THAT SOMOZIST GUARDS ARE FIGHTING WITH THE SALVADORAN ARMY. IS THERE ANYTHING TO THIS? THERE ARE RUMORS TO THAT EFFECT. SOME INSURGENT RADIO STATIONS HAVE REPORTED IT, AND THEY HAVE ALSO MENTIONED TROOPS FROM OTHER CENTRAL AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS. YES, BUT NOT WITH THE PERSISTENCE THAT PREVAILS NOW. OF COURSE. MANY TELEPHONE CALLS, SURVEILLACE BY SUSPICIOUS INDIVIDUALS AND VEHICLES AT THE RESIDENCE THROUGHOUT THE DAY, AND ESPECIALLY DIRECT THREATS BY TELEPHONE. I WOULD IMAGINE THEY ARE SALVADORAN RIGHTWING EXTREMISTS, BETTER KNOWN AS DEATH SQUADS. THEY BEGAN TO SELECTIVELY SHOOT PEOPLE. THERE IS THE CASE OF MRS NORMA GIROLA DE HERRERA, PRESIDENT OF THE WOMENS INSTITUTE, A VERY PROGRESSIVE INSTITUTION. MRS HERERA WAS VERY WELL KNOWN, AND SHE WAS MURDERED UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE ASSASINATION OF THE JESUITS; ON THE SAME DAY. [LACAYO[ I DO NOT HAVE ANY MORE INFORMATION BECAUSE OF THE CITY'S MILITARIZATION. A STATE OF SIEGE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED, THE CIRCULATION OF VEHICLES IS MINIMAL, COMMUNICATION IS SPARSE, TELEPHONES ARE TAPPED. YES, THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN. THEY ARE WAGING A WAR WHICH CONSISTS AT TIMES OF MAINTAINING POSITIONS, AT OTHER TIMES OF MOBILIZING. ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS CONTROLLED AREAS CEASED TO BE CONTROLLED BUT THE WAR CONTINUES. NO, I DO NOT KNOW. THE GOVERNMENT DID THAT DIRECTLY THROUGH THE FOREIGN MINISTRY. NO, BECAUSE WE DID NOT KNOW. HOWEVER, THE TRUTH IS THAT WE NEVER HAD PROTECTION.

DEV-MUC3-0808	SAN SALVADOR, 18 NOV 89 -- THE CAPITAL FELL INTO DARKNESS SATURDAY NIGHT AS ELECTRICAL SERVICE THROUGHOUT SAN SALVADOR WAS CUT AND THE COUNTRY ENTERED THE EIGHTH DAY OF A NATIONWIDE REBEL OFFENSIVE. INSURGENTS FROM THE LEFTIST FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT STILL HELD KEY POSITIONS AROUND THE CAPITAL, FENDING OFF FIERCE SALVADORAN AIR AND ARTILLERY ATTACKS. THE POWER OUTAGE, WHICH HAD AFFECTED CERTAIN ZONES OF THE CITY AND SURROUNDING SUBURBS BUT NOT THE ENTIRE CITY OVER THE PAST WEEK OF FIGHTING, CAME AMID UNCONFIRMED REPORTS THAT THE ARMY WAS PREPARING A MAJOR COUNTER-OFFENSIVE TO DRIVE THE REBELS FROM THE SAN SALVADOR METROPOLITAN AREA. GOVERNMENT SOLDIERS BLOCKED ALL ACCESS TO THE REBEL-HELD NORTHERN AND EASTERN SECTORS OF THE CAPITAL. THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS CONTINUED TO FLEE THE COMBAT ZONES, WHERE A NUMBER HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE CROSS-FIRE SINCE THE LEFTIST FMLN LAUNCHED ITS ATTACK NOVEMBER 11 -- THE BOLDEST OFFENSIVE OF THE 10-YEAR CIVIL WAR. INSURGENTS WHO THURSDAY HAD EVACUATED THE DISTRICT OF ZACAMIL -- DEVASTATED BY THE ARMED FORCES' AERIAL FIREBOMBINGS -- REGROUPED IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE, AN AREA NORTH OF THE CAPITAL, ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS.

AUTHORITIES ESTIMATED THAT MORE THAN 2,000 PEOPLE HAD BEEN KILLED OR INJURED IN THE CONFLICT.

DEV-MUC3-0809	SAN SALVADOR, 19 NOV 89 -- CIN REPORTS THE FOLLOWING TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE: 1. THE ARMED FORCES HAS ABSOLUTE CONTROL OVER NATIONAL TERRITORY IN SAN MIGUEL, ZACATECOLUCA, USULUTAN, SANTA ANA, AND SAN SALVADOR. THE SITUATION IS UNDER CONTROL; ONLY A FEW SNIPERS REMAIN IN BUILDINGS AND TREES. 2. CITIZENS WHO ARE STILL STILL SEEKING REFUGE IN THEIR WORK PLACES ARE ADVISED TO RETURN TO THEIR RESPECTIVE HOMES BEFORE 1800 WHEN THE CURFEW BEGINS. 3. PARENTS ARE ADVISED TO MAINTAIN CALM IN THEIR HOMES AND ENSURE THAT THEIR CHILDREN DO NOT LEAVE HOME UNTIL ORDER HAS BEEN FULLY RESTORED. 4. THE PRESS, RADIO, AND TELEVISION ARE WARNED THAT IF THEY BROADCAST ANY INFORMATION TO PUBLIC WHICH HAS NOT BEEN CONFIRMED BY THE CIN, THEY COULD FACE PENALITES; THEIR FACILITIES COULD BE INDEFINITELY CLOSED. 5. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE MUST REALIZE THAT THE SECURITY CORPS, NATIONAL GUARD, TREASURY POLICE, NATIONAL POLICE, AND RAPID DEPLOYMENT BATTALIONS SUCH AS THE ATLCATL, ATONAL, ARCE, BELLOSO, AND BRACAMONTE, AND BRIGADES BELONGING TO OUR GLORIOUS ARMED FORCES HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DEFEATED FMLN MURDERERS TO ENSURE THE FREEDOM AND TRANQUILLITY OF OUR SALVADORAN BROTHERS. WARLIKE OPERATIONS LAUNCHED IN ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH INVOLVED GROUND AND AIR FORCES, WERE NECESSARY BECAUSE OF THE VIOLENCE AND CRUELTY SHOWN BY THE TERRORIST MURDERERS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. 6. ALL BASIC AND VITAL SERVICES IN THE COUNTRY, SUCH AS WATER AND ELECTRICITY, ARE BEING PROVIDED NORMALLY AND ARE UNDER ARMED FORCES CONTROL. 7. WITH GREAT SATISFACTION, WE REPORT TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES HAVE RECEIVED EXPRESSIONS OF SUPPORT FROM NEARLY ALL PROFESSIONAL UNIONS AND BUSINESS GROUPS. THEY HAVE AGREED TO RESUME DAILY ACTIVITIES TO SUPPORT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S EFFORTS TO BRING ABOUT PEACE AND PROGRESS.
DEV-MUC3-0810	CLANDESTINE, 19 NOV 89 -- COMMANDER ROBERTO ROCA, THE REPERCUSSIONS OF THE JESUITS' WERE NOT LONG IN COMING. ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ONES WAS THE EDITORIAL OF AN IMPORTANT U.S. NEWSPAPER, THE NEW YORK TIMES, ON 18 NOVEMBER. THE EDITORIAL SAYS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT IF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI DOES NOT ORDER A QUICK, THOROUGH, AND GENUINE INVESTIGATION TO CATCH THE ASSASSINS, HE MIGHT LOSE THE UNITED STATES' ECONOMIC AID. THE EDITORIAL ALSO STATES THE DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS HAVE SAID THAT THE MILITARY AID SHOULD BE SUSPENDED IF EL SALVADOR CANNOT CONTROL AND PUNISH THE DEATH SQUADS. THEY ADD THAT IF HE DOES NOT HEED THE WARNING, THE NEXT STATEMENT MIGHT BE ISSUED BY BOTH PARTIES. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS IMPORTANT STATEMENT BY AN INFLUENTIAL U.S. NEWSPAPER FOR CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AND THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES? ACTUALLY, THE NEW YORK TIMES STATES THE FEELING PERVADING THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES. IT IS A WAY OF CONFIRMING THAT THE FASCIST GROUPS PREVAIL WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT AND ARENA , AND THEY ARE DECIDING THE REGIME'S POLICIES. POLITICAL OPINION IN THE UNITED STATES HAS UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN SHAKEN BY THIS MASSACRE PLANNED BY ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT. WE BELIEVE THAT U.S. POLITICIANS WILL PROGRESSIVELY COME TO SUPPORT THE U.S. PEOPLE'S FEELINGS AND WILL DEMAND THAT CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT ORDER THE INVESTIGATION. WE KNOW THAT THIS WILL NOT BE EASY IN EL SALVADOR, BECAUSE, AS THE EDITORIAL POINTS OUT, SIMILAR ASSASSINATIONS HAVE BEEN PERPETRATED INNUMERABLE TIMES. THESE CASES HAVE BEEN SURROUNDED BY ABSOLUTE SECRECY; NO CULPRITS ARE FOUND; AND WITNESSES HAVE TESTIFIED MANY TIMES THAT THE ACTIONS WERE CARRIED OUT BY ARMED FORCES MEMBERS, EITHER DRESSED AS CIVILIANS OR IN UNIFORM. HOWEVER, THE POLICY OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THE GOVERNMENT PROTECTS THE CULPRITS. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS CIVILIAN ASSASSINATION, MEANING THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE FACT THAT PRACTICALLY ALL THE LEADERS OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT WERE SOUGHT OUT THAT SAME NIGHT TO BE KILLED, PLUS THE FACT THAT THE KILLING OF THE COOPERATIVE MEMBERS WAS CARRIED OUT WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE GREAT BATTLES BEING FOUGHT IN EL SALVADOR'S URBAN AREAS, WILL EVENTUALLY CONVINCE U.S. POLITICIANS THAT THE GOVERNMENT THEY HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING IS CLEARLY A FASCIST GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST IN ANY KIND OF DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION.
DEV-MUC3-0811	CLANDESTINE, 19 NOV 89 -- REAL LIFE IS MAKING IT EVIDENT THAT IN EL SALVADOR WE MUST FIND A DEMOCRATIC SOLUTION TO THE TERRIBLE CRISIS BEING ENDURED -- TO THE WAR. THIS DEMOCRATIC SOLUTION MEANS ISOLATING AND EXCLUDING THE FASCISTS FROM POWER BECAUSE THEY ARE AGAINST DEMOCRACY. MR CRISTIANI CANNOT SAY UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HE SHARES NO RESPONSIBILITY IN THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS. IN THE FRAMEWORK OF HIS FRUSTRATED ATTEMPT TO STOP THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE, HE UNLEASHED THE DOGS OF WAR -- ALL THE FASCIST ELEMENTS -- SO THAT THEY WOULD COMMIT ALL THE OUTRAGES THEY HAVE COMMITTED. THIS INCLUDES THE FASCIST ELEMENTS IN THE AIR FORCE AND THEIR INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION, AS WELL AS THE DEATH SQUADS, WHO WERE UNLEASHED SO THEY WOULD MURDER PEOPLE WHO BEST EXPRESS THE DEMOCRATIC FEELINGS OF THE PEOPLE AND, AS IN THE CASE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, TO ELIMINATE A VALUABLE SECTOR OF THE SALVADORAN INTELLIGENTSIA AT THE SERVICE OF DEMOCRACY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. AS WE ALL KNOW, THE JESUITS HAD CONTINUOUSLY DENOUNCED THE UNJUST SYSTEM IN EL SALVADOR AND HAD CALLED FOR CLEARING UP ALL CRIMES. THE FASCISTS, IN THEIR HATRED, PUT AN END TO THE LIVES OF THESE JESUITS BELIEVING THAT THEY CAN HIDE THE SUN WITH ONE FINGER. THE INDIGNATION OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL BE INCREASINGLY BACKED BY THE U.S. PEOPLE AS A RESULT OF THEIR INDIGNATION AND BY U.S. POLITICIANS WHO HAVE BECOME AWARE OF THE FACT THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO PUT AN END TO FASCIST OUTRAGES IN EL SALVADOR. THE FASCISTS REPRESENT A BARRIER THAT MUST BE DESTROYED AND DEFEATED TO HAVE DEMOCRACY IN EL SALVADOR. COMMANDER, IF THE UNITED STATES DECIDED TO CUT OFF MILITARY AND ECONOMIC AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT, WHAT IMPACT WOULD THIS HAVE ON THE ARMED FORCES? WE HAVE SAID ON MANY OCCASIONS THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES WOULD HAVE LOST THE WAR SOME TIME AGO WERE IT NOT FOR U.S. SUPPORT AND FINANCING. AS WE HAVE STATED IN ALL OUR PROPOSALS FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION, OUR OBJECTIVE IS NEITHER THE DESTRUCTION NOR THE ELIMINATION OF THE ARMED FORCES. WHAT WE WANT IS FOR THE ARMED FORCES TO GET RID OF THE FASCIST ELEMENTS THAT HAVE TURNED IT INTO A TOOL THAT ACTS AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND DEMOCRACY. WE BELIEVE THAT SENSIBLE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES OFFICERS, THOSE WHO HAVE NOT LOST THEIR HEADS, MUST TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING, THE POLITICAL DEFEAT OF THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT, AND THE MILITARY DEFEAT OF THE METHODS AND TACTICS .
DEV-MUC3-0812	CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- THEREFORE, THE WESTERN EUROPEAN PRESS, POLITICAL PARTIES, LABOR UNIONS, AND GENERAL PUBLIC ARE VERY STRONGLY REJECTING CRISTIANI'S REGIME. THE CONGRESSES AND PARLIAMENTS OF MANY WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE SAYING THAT THE COOPERATION THE SALVADORAN REGIME RECEIVES SHOULD BE REEVALUATED. COMRADE SALVADOR SAMAYOA, THE GOVERNMENT NETWORK IS REPORTING THAT U.S. AID TO CRISTIANI WILL CONTINUE. THE COLONELS HAVE ALSO SAID THAT THE FMLN CANNOT DEFEAT THE ARMED FORCES BECAUSE THE LATTER HAS MILITARY AND ECONOMIC AID FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. RETURNING TO THIS POINT, COMRADE SAMAYOA, WHAT IS YOUR VIEW? WHAT OPTIONS DOES THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAVE CONCERNING EL SALVADOR, AND WHAT IMPACT HAS THE NEW SITUATION HAD ON U.S. POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR? AS I SAID, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MUST TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT A NEW INTERNAL SITUATION OF GENERALIZED POPULAR, POLITICAL, AND SOCIAL DISCONTENT IS TAKING SHAPE, AND THAT FROM THIS MOMENT ON ITS POLICY IN EL SALVADOR WILL UNDERGO ISOLATION AND WILL BE REJECTED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND EVEN BY VERY IMPORTANT SECTORS WITHIN THE HOUSE AND SENATE. SO FAR, THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION HAS STUBBORNLY CONTINUED PROVIDING AID AND SUPPORT TO A REGIME THAT IS OBVIOUSLY CRIMINAL AND GENOCIDAL, AND THAT POLICY IS CURRENTLY A VERY STRONG DEBATE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ARE TO SINK WITH THE CRISTIANI REGIME, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY MOVING TOWARD DEFEAT AND MILITARY AND POLITICAL DESTRUCTION DESPITE ALL THE PROPAGANDA IT HAS MADE, OR TO CHANGE ITS OPINION WHILE THERE IS STILL TIME. THE ALTERNATIVE OF A CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT, A REPLACEMENT OF CRISTIANI'S REGIME OR THE MILITARY HIERARCHY, IS ALREADY UNDER DISCUSSION. THESE, THEREFORE, ARE THE TWO ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE TO THE UNITED STATES: EITHER CHANGE ITS POLICY IN TIME AND REPLACE CRISTIANI, OR THE GOVERNMENT WILL SINK BECAUSE ITS PROPAGANDA IS NOT WORKING. THE U.S. AMBASSADOR HAS MADE A FOOL OF HIMSELF. HE SAID THE GUERRILLAS HAD 1,500 MEN IN SAN SALVADOR, AND HE HAS LISTED CASUALTY FIGURES ACCORDING TO WHICH THE FMLN SUFFERED OVER 500 DEATHS, OVER 400 WOUNDED, AND OTHERS CAPTURED. ACCORDING TO THE FIGURES QUOTED BY THE U.S. AMBASSADOR, WHO PROVIDES GOVERNMENT WAR BULLETINS AND HAS ALMOST BECOME THE SALVADORAN DEFENSE MINISTER, THE FMLN ONLY HAS 200 MEN LEFT IN SAN SALVADOR. WHAT I FIND INEXPLICABLE IS THE GOVERNMENT'S NEED TO USE 40 OR 50 WAR PLANES AND HELICOPTERS, ALONG WITH ITS ARTILLERY AND ELITE BATTALIONS, TO BOMB AND DESTROY CITIES, ESPECIALLY SAN SALVADOR. THAT IS WHY THEIR PROPAGANDA HAS BACKFIRED ON THEM. IN THE UNITED STATES THE PRESS AND GENERAL PUBLIC KNOW FULL WELL THAT THE FMLN OFFENSIVE IS IN FULL FORCE AND IS MOVING FORWARD, AND THAT THE U.S. POLICY IS REACHING THE POINT OF TOTAL FAILURE. TO CONCLUDE, COMRADE SAMAYOA, WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE ON RADIO VENCEREMOS TO THE COMRADES WHO HAVE MAINTAINED THEIR POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL, ZACATECOLUCA, USULUTAN, AND VARIOUS POINTS OF THE NATIONAL TERRITORY? WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO THE FIGHTERS AND THE PEOPLE? TO ALL THE COMRADES WHO ARE FIGHTING IN TRENCHES THROUGHOUT THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF OUR COUNTRY, I MUST SAY THAT THE AFFECTION AND ADMIRATION YOU HAVE GENERATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, THE SOLIDARITY WITH YOUR STRUGGLE, AND THE SURPRISING STRENGTH AND HEROISM YOU HAVE DISPLAYED ARE NOW RECEIVING SUPPORT FROM ALMOST ALL OF THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD. THEREFORE, OUR STRUGGLE NOT ONLY IS NOT ALONE, BUT IT HAS NOW ACHIEVED MAXIMUM SUPPORT OF ALL TYPES: POLITICAL, MATERIAL, ECONOMIC. SOLIDARITY HAS MULTIPLIED HUNDREDFOLD OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, AND IT WILL BE AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SOURCE OF SUPPORT THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO COMPLETING THE FASCIST REGIME'S DESTRUCTION. THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD ADMIRE THE STRUGGLE THE COMRADES AND FIGHTERS IN ALL THE CITIES IN THIS COUNTRY ARE WAGING, AND THEY VERY CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT THE STRUGGLE IS FOR A JUST CAUSE AND AGAINST A COMPLETELY ILLEGITIMATE, FASCIST, AND CRIMINAL REGIME. THE COMRADES CAN REST ASSURED OF THIS INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT, WHICH IS CURRENTLY VERY GREAT. IT IS IMPRESSIVE TO SEE ALL OF THE AFFECTION AND ADMIRATION THAT OUR FIGHTERS ARE RECEIVING FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SALVADOR. OUR GREETINGS TO ALL THE OTHER COMRADES. THANK YOU, . THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
DEV-MUC3-0813	CLANDESTINE, 19 NOV 89 -- ATTENTION. WE HAVE REPORTS THAT THERE IS HEAVY FIGHTING GOING ON IN THE NORTHERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR AND IN APOPA. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION. THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT HAS INTENSIFIED FIGHTING AGAINST SPECIAL BATTALIONS IN SAN SALVADOR. WE ALSO REPORT THAT DURING THIS FIGHTING IN SAN SALVADOR, AT 1600 THIS AFTERNOON, OUR ANTI-AIRCRAFT CREWS DOWNED A SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTER. WE HIT THE HELICOPTER NEAR SAQUIRO IN ARCE STREET AND IT CRASHED. WE ARE TO RECEIVE MORE DETAILS AND A REPORT ABOUT THE CREW'S FATE LATER. WE REPEAT, A SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTER WAS DOWNED IN SAN SALVADOR AT 1600 TODAY. THIS IS THE SECOND HELICOPTER WE HAVE DOWNED IN URBAN COMBAT. AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR OFFENSIVE WE REPORTED THAT A HELICOPTER HAD BEEN DOWNED AND ONE OF ITS PILOTS HAD BEEN KILLED.
DEV-MUC3-0814	CLANDESTINE, 19 NOV 89 -- COMRADE SALVADOR SAMAYOA, WE HAVE HEARD REPORTS ON STATEMENTS BY THE U.S. AMBASSADOR IN SAN SALVADOR, WILLIAM WALKER, WHO SAID THAT DESPITE THE BOMBINGS HIS GOVERNMENT, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, WILL CONTINUE GIVING MILITARY AID AND SUPPORT TO THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER, IT SEEMS THE SITUATION HAS CHANGED FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUITS. AT THIS MOMENT, HOW DOES THE UNITED STATES PERCEIVE THE NEW SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR? AT THE LEVEL OF THE U.S. PEOPLE, THERE IS A TOTAL REPUDIATION OF THE FASCIST CRIMINAL GOVERNMENT AND OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES BECAUSE OF THE BOMBINGS -- WHICH HAVE BECOME A TRUE GENOCIDE -- IN VARIOUS DENSELY POPULATED CITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS IN EL SALVADOR, AS WELL AS BECAUSE OF THE ASSASSINATIONS PERPETRATED BY THE SALVADORAN ARMY AGAINST THE JESUIT PRIESTS AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY . THERE HAVE BEEN VERY RADICAL DEMONSTRATIONS EXPRESSING MUCH INDIGNATION BY VARIOUS U.S. SOCIAL SECTORS. MOREOVER, IN SOME OF THOSE DEMONSTRATIONS, THE POLICE BARRICADES WERE BROKEN. IMPORTANT U.S. POLITICAL PERSONALITIES SUCH AS JESSE JACKSON, ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS LEADERS IN THE UNITED STATES, PARTICIPATED IN THE DEMONSTRATIONS. THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN DEMONSTRATIONS IN BOSTON, CHICAGO, NEW YORK, SAN FRANCISCO, AND LOS ANGELES. IN AT LEAST 20 CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES PEOPLE HAVE EXPRESSED ALL THEIR REPUDIATION AND INDIGNATION OVER THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND THE U.S. POLICY IN EL SALVADOR. SINCE THE ASSASSINATION OF THE UCA PRIESTS, A LARGE NUMBER OF IMPORTANT U.S. SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES ARE SAYING THAT U.S. MILITARY AID TO THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES AND GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE CUT AND SUSPENDED. SENATOR KENNEDY IN PARTICULAR MADE A VERY STRONG STATEMENT, SAYING THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES' ATTITUDE SIMPLY EXPRESSES THE FAILURE OF 10 YEARS OF U.S. POLICY -- WHICH HAS BEEN SPENT FEEDING, TRAINING, ARMING, AND FINANCING AN ARMED FORCE THAT CARRIES OUT ASSASSINATIONS. IN ADDITION TO SENATOR KENNEDY, THERE ARE MANY U.S. SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN WHO ARE REQUESTING THE TOTAL SUSPENSION OF MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR. AT THIS TIME, THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF REPUDIATION IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE PAST 10 YEARS. HOWEVER, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, AND THE WHITE HOUSE CONTINUE SUPPORTING THE CRIMINAL REGIME AND GIVING IT FURTHER EMERGENCY AID. COMRADE, YESTERDAY WE LEARNED ABOUT ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN THE MAIN U.S. NEWSPAPERS THE NEW YORK TIMES AND THE WASHINGTON POST, WHICH STRONGLY QUESTION THE GOVERNMENT, SPECIFICALLY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI, THE CHIEF OF THE FASCIST DICTATORSHIP. WHAT IS THE SITUATION OF THE CRISTIANI SPEECH AND HIS ALLEGED LEGITIMACY, NOT ONLY IN THE UNITED STATES BUT ALSO AT THE LEVEL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY? THE ALLEGED LEGITIMACY OF CRISTIANI COLLAPSED. IN THE UNITED STATES, THEY SAID CRISTIANI WAS HAD GOOD INTENTIONS, BUT THE RIGHT-WING AND THE DEATH SQUADS DID NOT LET HIM WORK. THE SPEECH FAILED BECAUSE IT IS NOW CLEAR THAT AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES, CRISTIANI IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE GENOCIDE IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS IN THE COUNTRY . THE MEDIA HAVE ALSO REPORTED THE ARREST OF U.S. RELIGIOUS MEN AND OF SWISS, FRENCH, SPANISH, AND JAPANESE CITIZENS. THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS A GOVERNMENT ACCUSING EVERYONE OF COOPERATING WITH THE GUERRILLAS, AND THIS HAS CAUSED A TOTAL LOSS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S PRESTIGE. EDITORIALS ON 18 NOVEMBER IN THE MAIN U.S. NEWSPAPERS CRISTIANI IS NOT MORE THAN . AT EMBASSIES AND CONSULATES IN MOST COUNTRIES IN WESTERN EUROPE -- IN ITALY, SPAIN, THE FRG, FRANCE, SWEDEN, DENMARK AND EVERYWHERE -- THERE HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATIONS CALLED BY LABOR UNIONS, POLITICAL PARTIES, AND PEOPLE'S MOVEMENTS IN THOSE COUNTRIES TO EXPRESS REPUDIATION. IN LONDON, ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS, AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, URGED EVERYONE TO STAGE DEMONSTRATIONS IN FRONT OF ALL SALVADORAN EMBASSIES AND CONSULATES.
DEV-MUC3-0815	CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE HAS NOT BEEN DEFEATED AND CANNOT BE DEFEATED. INTERNATIONAL REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE REVOLUTIONARY FORCES HAVE BECOME STRONG IN THE CITY, THAT THEY ARE MAKING TACTICAL MOVEMENTS, AND THAT IN SPITE OF THE BARBARISM WITH WHICH THE ARMED FORCES HAS BEEN OPERATING, THE GUERRILLAS MAINTAIN ALL OF THEIR OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES. THE SITUATION CANNOT DEFEAT US. THERE MUST BE A SOLUTION, AND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE INCREASINGLY, AND IN DIFFERENT WAYS, BECOMING INVOLVED IN THE REVOLUTIONARY PROCESS TO DEFEAT THE FASCISTS AND THE GENOCIDAL TACTICS THEY ARE USING. WE BELIEVE THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING IS HAVING AN IMPACT ON INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION, AND THIS UNDOUBTEDLY WILL HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE ARMED FORCES AND COULD RESULT IN AN EFFORT TO SAVE THE INSTITUTION. WE BELIEVE THAT IN THE ARMED FORCES THERE ARE OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS WHO REJECT FASCISM. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY DESERTIONS IN THE ARMY FILES. MANY ORDERS ARE BEING DISOBEYED, ORDERS OF A GENOCIDAL NATURE USUALLY. THIS IS THE STARTING POINT OF AN EVENT THAT WILL STUN POLITICAL OPINION IN EL SALVADOR. WE BELIEVE THAT IF THIS SAVAGE KILLING OF PEOPLE DOES NOT STOP, THE MILITARY INSTITUTION WILL BE SIGNING ITS OWN DEATH SENTENCE. THE PEOPLE CANNOT TOLERATE A MILITARY THAT FUNCTIONS UNDER A MOST SAVAGE AND DESPOTIC REGIME, AND THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT IS IN HOT WATER, WE COULD SAY. THE REVOLUTIONARY OFFENSIVE, AS I HAVE NOTED, IS BEING DEVELOPED. WE HAVE SOLID POSITIONS IN FOUR OF EL SALVADOR'S MAIN CITIES, AND AS WE HAVE SAID BEFORE: NO ONE IS GOING TO PUSH US OUT. VICTORY FOR DEMOCRACY HAS BEEN ASSURED. THE WORLD WILL BACK US IN THE FACE OF THE SAVAGE GENOCIDE BY THE GOVERNMENT FORCES, ESPECIALLY BY THE FASCIST MILITARY ELEMENTS IN EL SALVADOR. TO CONCLUDE, COMMANDER, THE FUNERAL RITES FOR THE THE PRIESTS WHO WERE MURDERED IN SAN SALVADOR ARE TAKING PLACE AT THIS MOMENT, AROUND NOON TIME, AND ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND HIS WIFE ARE ATTENDING THIS CEREMONY. DO YOU HAVE ANY MESSAGE FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, FOR THE STUDENTS FROM THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY, FOR THE CHRISTIAN PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL, WHO ARE MOURNING THE DEATH OF THESE WORTHY JESUITS? WE HAVE ALREADY EXPRESSED, AND I WILL REITERATE IT NOW, THE DEEP SORROW OF THE FMLN MILITANTS AND THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL OVER THE LOSS OF THESE WORTHY JESUIT PRIESTS WHO HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT STRUGGLERS FOR DEMOCRACY AND PEACE IN EL SALVADOR. WE SHARE THE FEELINGS OF THE SALVADORAN RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY. I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE PRESENCE OF CRISTIANI AT THE BURIAL FOR THE JESUIT PRIESTS CALLS FOR A NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL OUTCRY IN DEMAND FOR PUNISHMENT FOR THE PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ATROCIOUS ASSASSINATION. CRISTIANI CANNOT GO TO THAT BURIAL AND DO NOTHING ABOUT PEOPLE TO WHOM HE OPENED DOORS SO THAT THEY COULD COMMIT THESE KILLINGS. EVERYBODY MUST DEMAND THAT CRISTIANI RESPOND TO THE PEOPLE'S INDIGNATION BY PUNISHING THE PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIME. CRISTIANI CANNOT SPEAK ABOUT HAVING MORAL AUTHORITY FOR ATTENDING THAT BURIAL UNLESS HE PUNISHES THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE. IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO PUNISH THE ASSASSINS. THERE MUST BE A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF THE WAVE OF CRIME THAT HAS BEEN UNLEASHED IN EL SALVADOR. THE MOST NOTORIOUS CRIME HAS BEEN THE KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, BUT IN THE PAST 8 DAYS MANY COMMON PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY LEADERS HAVE ALSO BEEN MURDERED. THE BOMBING HAS BEEN INTENSE. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE ENDURING MUCH PAIN AND THEY DEMAND THAT THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT BE PUNISHED. WE AGAIN REITERATE THE PAIN OF THE PEOPLE OVER THE DEATH OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH MUST BRAVELY AND LOUDLY DEMAND JUSTICE IN THE FACE OF THESE CRIMES.
DEV-MUC3-0816	PANAMA CITY , 19 NOV 89 -- SAN SALVADOR, 19 NOV -- SALVADORAN CLERGYMEN FROM THE CATHOLIC, LUTHERAN, AND BAPTIST CHURCHES HAVE CLAIMED THAT THEY ARE BEING "PERSECUTED" BY GROUPS OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY IN THE STYLE OF THE ULTRARIGHTIST "DEATH SQUADS" MEDARDO GOMEZ, A LUTHERAN CHURCH BISHOP, SAID TODAY THAT CLERGYMEN ARE SUBJECT TO "PERSECUTION." HE SAID THAT MEMBERS OF THE POLICE FORCE ARE "BESIEGING" SHELTERS ESTABLISHED BY THE RELIGIOUS GROUPS TO BENEFIT THOUSANDS OF VICTIMS OF THE FIGHTING. THE LUTHERAN BISHOP SAID THAT SIX GERMANS, FOUR U.S. CITIZENS, A CANADIAN, AND A SPANIARD WERE ARRESTED BY THE TREASURY POLICE 2 DAYS AGO IN A CHURCH IN SAN SALVADOR, WHERE THE TROOPS WERE LOOKING FOR "GUERRILLA COLLABORATORS." THE FOREIGNERS WERE DETAINED AFTER HAVING HELPED TO AID CIVILIANS WHO TOOK REFUGE IN CHURCHES IN SAN SALVADOR AFTER FLEEING FROM THE BLOODY CLASHES BETWEEN THE MILITARY AND REBELS IN THE MEJICANOS, CUSCATANCINGO, ZACAMIL, CIUDAD DELGADO, SAN JACINTO, AND SOYAPANGO NEIGHBORHOODS, LOCATED IN THE NORTHERN AND NORTHEASTERN PARTS OF THE CAPITAL. SEVERAL PRIESTS, INCLUDING DANIEL LOPEZ, A SPANIARD, HAD TO EVACUATE THEIR PARISHES, WHICH ARE LOCATED IN THE EMBATTLED AREAS, AFTER THE CHURCHES WERE SURROUNDED BY SOLDIERS. LOPEZ HAD TO LEAVE THE SANTA MARIA DE LOS POBRES CHURCH IN THE LA CHACRA SLUM AREA IN EASTERN SAN SALVADOR AFTER IT WAS BOMBED BY THE AIR FORCE, ACCORDING TO ONE OF LOPEZ' ASSISTANTS, WHO IS ALSO A SPANIARD. RELIGIOUS SOURCES TOLD THE PRESS THAT TREASURY POLICEMEN ASSAULTED SOME 50 REFUGEES IN THE SAN ROQUE SHELTER, LOCATED IN SOUTHERN SAN SALVADOR, WHEN THEY WERE SEARCHING FOR A PRIEST NAMED CORTEZ. THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS SAID THAT THE PERSECUTION WAS STEPPED UP AFTER THE START OF THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE IN THE CAPITAL, WHICH BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER AND SO FAR HAS LEFT SOME 1,000 DEAD, INCLUDING 6 JESUIT PRIESTS WHO WERE ASSASSINATED.
DEV-MUC3-0817	SAN SALVADOR, 19 NOV 89 -- FIFTY-FIVE SPANIARDS WERE EVACUATED FROM EL SALVADOR TODAY FOR SECURITY REASONS IN AN AIR FORCE PLANE WHICH LEFT THE COUNTRY AT 1545 FROM THE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AT COMALAPA. SPANISH DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER INOCENCIO ARIAS WAS ON BOARD THE PLANE. THE AIRPLANE'S DEPARTURE WAS DELAYED TO WAIT FOR ARIAS AND OTHER SPANISH OFFICIALS TO ARRIVE AT THE AIRPORT AFTER ATTENDING THE FUNERAL OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS, FIVE OF THEM SPANIARDS, WHO WERE KILLED ON THURSDAY.
DEV-MUC3-0818	SAN SALVADOR, 19 NOV 89 -- THE FOLLOWING IS AN UPDATED REPORT OF THE MILITARY SITUATION. THE ARMED FORCES INFORM THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE THAT THE AREAS IN SAN SALVADOR WHERE ARMY TROOPS ARE CURRENTLY CONDUCTING COUNTERINSURGENCY OPERATIONS ARE THE GUADALUPE AND LOS SANTOS NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE SOYOPANGO MUNICIPALITY, AND SAN SEBASTIAN AT CIUDAD DELGADO. THE ARMED FORCES EXPECT TO EXPEL THE REMAINING SMALL REBEL REDOUBTS FROM THESE AREAS IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS. THERE WERE HARRASSMENT ACTIONS IN APOPA THIS MORNING, BUT NO CASUALTIES WERE REPORTED. THE ARMY CONTROLS THE MEJICANOS AND ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOODS. THE ARMED FORCES CONTROL THE SITUATION IN THE WESTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. THE SITUATION IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY IS ALSO UNDER CONTROL, EXCEPT FOR A FEW TERRORIST GROUPS CURRENTLY BEING EXPELLED FROM THE CITY OF SAN MIGUEL. THE ARMED FORCES JOINT COMMAND STAFF REPORTS THAT 840 TERRORISTS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND 558 HAVE BEEN WOUNDED AS OF TODAY. THE ARMY HAS SUFFERED THE LOSS OF 220 SOLDIERS, WHO HEROICALLY OFFERED THEIR LIVES TO DEFEND THE FATHERLAND FROM COMMUNISM. ALSO, 457 SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN WOUNDED. THE FOLLOWING WAR MATERIEL HAS BEEN CONFICATED: 446 RIFLES OF DIFFERENT CALIBERS, 87 GRENADE LAUNCHERS, , 22 MACHINEGUNS, 18 SUBMACHINEGUNS, AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF AMMUNITION AND OTHER WAR MATERIEL.
DEV-MUC3-0819	SAN SALVADOR, 19 NOV 89 -- THIS IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY, THIS IS OUR MISSION, AND WE ARE WILLING TO GIVE OUR LIVES IN SACRIFICE, AS HAS BEEN PROVEN BY THE MANY HEROIC SOLDIERS WHO ARE DYING IN THIS STRUGGLE TO DEFEND JUSTICE, PEACE, DEMOCRACY, AND THE WELL-BEING OF THESE PEOPLE WHOM WE LOVE SO MUCH, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. ARMED FORCES, DO NOT FEAR THE ENEMY. GO FORWARD WITH YOUR RESOLVE AND SPIRIT. OUR FAITH IN GOD AND OUR CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES GIVE US THE TRUTH AND THE STRENGTH TO CONTINUE DESTROYING THE FORCES THAT ARE TRYING TO WIPE OUT OUR HISTORY, TRADITION, VALUES, AND CITIZENS' PRINCIPLES. FOR EACH OFFICER AND SOLDIER LOST IN THE STRUGGLE, THERE IS NO OTHER MISSION BUT TO DEFEAT THE ENEMY, TO DESTROY THE TERRORISTS' PLANS, AND TO ONCE AND FOR ALL WIPE OUT THIS MANEUVER, THIS ATTEMPT TO DESTROY THE INSTITUTIONALITY OF EL SALVADOR. THIS IS A TIMELY OCCASION, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, TO SAY THAT THE ARMED FORCES AS AN INSTITUTION AT SOCIETY'S SERVICE DEEPLY REGRET AND HAVE BEEN DISMAYED BY THE INCIDENTS AT THE JOSE SIMEON CANAS CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY. WE CONDEMN, POINT AT, AND DEEPLY REJECT THESE IRRATIONAL AND VIOLENT ACTIONS, WHICH ARE AIMED AGAINST SALVADORAN INTELLECTUALS. WE, LIKE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, ALSO POINT TO, QUESTION, AND TOTALLY REJECT THESE ACTIONS WHICH ONLY BRING MOURNING AND GRIEF AND, FURTHERMORE -- AS THE TERRORIST FORCES HAVE DONE ON OTHER OCCASIONS -- CREATE CONFUSION, DECEIT, AND FURTHER TORMENT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY SUFFERED SO MUCH. THE ARMED FORCES CONVEY THEIR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL JESUIT COMMUNITY, AND WE ARE WILLING -- AS THE GOVERNMENT HAS POINTED OUT -- TO CARRY OUT THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS, SO THAT SOONER OR LATER WE WILL FIND THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS SITUATION AND APPLY TO THEM THE PUNISHMENT THEY DESERVE FOR SUCH IRRATIONAL, VIOLENT ACTIONS THAT ONLY BRING GRIEF, TEARS, AND BLOOD TO OUR SALVADORAN PEOPLE. SALVADORAN PEOPLE, I BELIEVE THE TIME HAS COME TO FURTHER DEMONSTRATE OUR STOICISM. I BELIEVE THIS IS THE TIME TO DEFINE, IN A TRUE CITIZEN'S SPIRIT, OUR RESOLVE TO DEFEAT, OUR RESOLVE TO WIN. WITHIN A SHORT WHILE, A FEW HOURS, OR A FEW DAYS, WE WILL JOIN THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO CELEBRATE THE VICTORY OF DEMOCRACY, JUSTICE, AND PEACE OVER THE IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE UNLEASHED BY THE FMLN. THIS MAY ALSO BE A TIMELY OPPORTUNITY TO POINT TO THE TERRORIST FORCES THAT ARE STILL TRYING TO HURT OUR CIVILIAN POPULATION, TO TELL THEM THAT THEIR CAUSE, THE CAUSE OF VIOLENCE, IRRATIONALITY, AND DISRESPECT FOR THE PEOPLE'S WILL, IS LOST. TO THIS EFFECT, THE ARMED FORCES ARE URGING THE TERRORIST FORCES TO SURRENDER, TO LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS, TO STOP THE VIOLENCE, AND TO JOIN CIVILIAN LIFE IN SOCIETY, IN PEACE AND HARMONY, SO THAT WE ALSO -- AS THE ARMED FORCES AND AS AN INSTITUTION -- CAN RESPECT THEIR LIVES AND INCORPORATE THEM INTO SOCIETY, AND SO THAT TOGETHER -- TODAY, TOMORROW, AND ALWAYS -- WE CAN BUILD A COUNTRY FULL OF LOVE, WELL- BEING, PEACE, AND FAITH IN GOD.
DEV-MUC3-0820	SAN SALVADOR, 20 NOV 89 -- EDUARDO COLORADO, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF EL SALVADOR, STATED TODAY THAT THERE IS A PLAN, POSSIBLY PREPARED BY THE GUERRILLAS, TO ATTACK SALVADORAN BISHOPS AND "CREATE GREATER PROBLEMS FOR THE GOVERNMENT" OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI. IN A NEWS CONFERENCE, THE OFFICIAL SAID THAT "IT WOULD BE ADVISABLE FOR THE BISHOPS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY OR NOT APPEAR IN PUBLIC." COLORADO, WHO DID NOT WANT WANT TO PROVIDE FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT THE ALLEGED PLAN, SAID THAT THE MAIN TARGET MIGHT BE MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, SINCE SEVERAL OF HIS RELATIVES ARE GUERRILLAS. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DID NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT PERSONS WHO HAVE LOST RELATIVES IN THE WAR "MIGHT CARRY OUT THE PLAN" THAT "MIGHT BE ORGANIZED BY THE TERRORISTS TO CREATE A GREATER CRISES FOR THE GOVERNMENT." THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID HE SENT A LETTER TO POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKING HIM TO REMOVE FROM THE COUNTRY THE BISHOPS WHO REPORTEDLY SUPPORT THE SO-CALLED "PEOPLE'S CHURCH." ACCORDING TO COLORADO, THIS "PEOPLE'S CHURCH" IS RESPONSIBLE IN PART FOR THE VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY. HE DID NOT SPECIFY WHICH BISHOPS ARE MENTIONED IN THE LETTER SENT TO THE POPE, BUT VARIOUS SOURCES INSIST HE IS REFERRING TO ARCHBISHOP ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS AND AUXILIARY BISHOP ROSA CHAVEZ, WHO SUPPORT A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY. IN THE LETTER, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SUGGESTS THAT POPE JOHN PAUL II REMOVE THESE SALVADORAN BISHOPS SINCE, HE INSISTS, "IT IS 1,000 TIMES BETTER TO PREVENT THESE INCIDENTS THAN TO HAVE TO INVESTIGATE THEM." THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S LETTER TO THE POPE WAS SENT 2 DAYS AFTER SIX JESUITS AND TWO WOMEN WERE KILLED IN SAN SALVADOR BY A GROUP OF 30 TO 40 MEN WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS, ACCORDING TO WITNESSES.
DEV-MUC3-0821	SAN SALVADOR, 20 NOV 89 -- THE ARMED FORCES MAINTAIN CONTROL IN THE CAPITAL. AFTER 6 DAYS OF INTENSE BATTLES BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE TERRORIST CRIMINALS OF THE FMLN , THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAVE SHOWN THEIR PROFESSIONALISM BY ACHIEVING TOTAL CONTROL IN THE CAPITAL. THE LOCATIONS WHERE THERE WERE THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS -- THE SLOPES OF SAN JACINTO HILL IN THE SOUTH AND SOYAPANGO, CIUDAD DELGADO, MEJICANOS, AND ZACAMIL -- HAVE BEEN RETAKEN BY THE ARMY DURING THE WEEKEND. EVEN THOUGH THE ARMY HAD DISLODGED THE MARXIST - LENINISTS FROM MEJICANOS, CIVILIAN ACCESS TO THAT AREA HAS NOT BEEN PERMITTED BECAUSE THE GUERRILLAS MINED THE ENTRANCES TO SEVERAL NEIGHBORHOODS AND SEVERAL HOUSES OF PEOPLE WHO DID NOT COOPERATE WITH THEM. IN CIUDAD DELGADO, ARMED FORCES SOLDIERS FOUGHT SMALL GROUPS OF GUERRILLAS WHO HAD HIDDEN IN HOUSES AND WHO PUT UP SOME RESISTANCE, WHICH WAS QUICKLY CONTROLLED BY THE ARMED FORCES. THE ARMED FORCES MAINTAIN ABSOLUTE CONTROL OVER AMATEPEC AND CIUDAD CREDISA NEIGHBORHOODS. ONWARD BRAVE SOLDIERS. CONTINUE FIGHTING TO KEEP OUR FATHERLAND FREE WITH GUARANTEES FOR ALL HONEST SALVADORANS.
DEV-MUC3-0822	SAN SALVADOR, 20 NOV 89 -- THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL, WHICH HAS BEEN THE SCENE OF FIERCE FIGHTING BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN ARMY AND GUERRILLAS OVER THE PAST WEEK, IS SLOWLY RETURNING TO NORMAL. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 9 DAYS MANY BUSINESSES AND WORKPLACES OPENED THEIR DOORS AND MANY BUSES WERE OPERATING. AFTER MANY DAYS IN WHICH MOST VEHICLES ON THE STREETS WERE AMBULANCES, OFFICIAL OR MILITARY VEHICLES, AND VEHICLES BELONGING TO NEWSMEN, THE CAPITAL AWAKENED TODAY TO HEAVY TRAFFIC WITH BUSES, TAXIS, TRUCKS, AND PRIVATE VEHICLES. THE 24-HOUR "CURFEW" DECREED BY THE ARMED FORCES IN THE DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS OF AYUTUXTEPEQUE, CUSCATANCINGO, AND MEJICANOS IN THE NORTHWESTERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR WAS SUSPENDED, SALVADORAN PRESIDENT AFLREDO CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED ON TELEVISION LAST NIGHT. THE "STATE OF SIEGE" AND "CURFEW," HOWEVER, WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT, FROM 1800 IN THE EVENING UNTIL 0600 IN THE MORNING. IN TWO OUTLYING NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE CAPITAL, GUERRILLA REDOUBTS AND SOLDIERS HAVE CONTINUED TO CLASH, PARTICULARLY IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS OF APOPA, CIUDAD DELGADO, AND SOYAPANGO. PRIVATE VEHICLES CANNOT OPERATE IN MUCH OF MEJICANOS NEIGHBORHOOD, ONE OF THE MAIN GUERRILLA BASTIONS LAST WEEK, AS A RESULT OF THE TRENCHES DUG BY THE REBELS AND DEBRIS PILED ON THE STREETS FROM DESTROYED BUILDINGS AND HOMES. THE SITUATION IS ALSO RETURNING TO NORMAL IN SOME PARTS OF THE INTERIOR, EXCEPT FOR SOME CITIES SUCH AS SAN MIGUEL IN THE EAST AND ZACATECOLUCA IN THE SOUTH WHERE THERE IS STILL FIERCE FIGHTING IN WHICH ELITE ARMY UNITS ARE INVOLVED. IN THE CAPITAL CITY, THE RED CROSS AND OTHER HUMANTARIAN ASSISTANCE ORGANIZATIONS ARE BEGINNING THE TASKS OF CLEANING UP THE RUBBLE AND REBUILDING THOUSANDS OF HOMES AFFECTED BY THE FIGHTING AND BOMBING, ACCORDING TO THE PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENTS. INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS SOURCES SAID THAT SOME 50,000 PERSONS HAVE HAD TO ABANDON THEIR HOMES AND ARE LODGED IN CHURCHES, STADIUMS, SCHOOLS, AND OTHER BUILDINGS SET UP AS TEMPORARY LODGINGS. INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE HAS ALSO BEGUN TO ARRIVE BRINGING FIRST AID FOR THE MANY CIVILIANS WHO WERE WOUNDED AND ARE BEING TREATED IN THE HOSPITALS WHERE HUNDREDS OF THE MORE THAN 1,000 WHO WERE TREATED LAST WEEK REMAIN, ACCORDING TO SALVADORAN HOSPITAL SOURCES. PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANO REPORTED ON A RADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK THAT "A FEW REDOUBTS" GUERRILLA REDOUBTS REMAIN, THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE CONTINUED TO ADVANCE, AND THAT "THE SITUATION WILL BE TOTALLY CONTROLLED SOON." HE SAID THAT THE WAR VICTIMS WILL BE GIVEN ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE AND THAT HIS CABINET WILL IMPLEMENT "RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMS," WITH WHICH HE INVITED THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO COOPERATE. THE STATE RADIO IS CELEBRATING THE "DEFEAT OF THE RED HORDES" OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT IN A TONE OF RESOUNDING VICTORY, CONSTANTLY RENDERING TRIBUTE TO THE LEADERS AND SOLDIERS OF THE BATTALIONS THAT HAVE PARTICIPATED IN EXPELLING THE GUERRILLAS FROM THE CAPITAL AND OTHER CITIES. "THE TERRORISTS FLED IN DISARRAY," ACCORDING TO THE STATE RADIO, WHICH COMMENTED ON THE MILITARY SITUATION THAT CIRCLES CLOSE TO THE FMLN INTERPRETED AS A "TACTICAL WITHDRAWAL." THE FIGHTING AND BOMBINGS IN THE CAPITAL AND OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY HAVE LEFT A TOLL OF MORE THAN 1,000 DEAD, HUNDREDS WOUNDED, AND TENS OF THOUSANDS HOMELESS.
DEV-MUC3-0823	CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- A FRIEND OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE FIRST TO ARRIVE ON THE SCENE, SAID THAT HE COUNTED SOME 500 OR 600 BULLET HOLES. HE SAID THAT THESE SHOTS WERE FIRED FROM SOME DISTANCE, WITH A MACHINEGUN SET UP ON A TRIPOD. THE PRIESTS WERE ALSO LATER SHOT IN A GARDEN NEARBY. ACCORDING TO INFORMATION THAT THE SOCIETY OF JESUS RECEIVED FOLLOWING THEIR OWN RECONSTRUCTION OF THE CRIME, WHICH THEY HAVE RELEASED TO THE AUTHORITIES INVESTIGATING THE CASE, THE KILLERS, APPROXIMATELY 30 MEN IN UNIFORM, ARRIVED SHORTLY BEFORE 0230. THEY MACHINEGUNNED THE HOUSE BEFORE ENTERING, DRAGGED THE PRIESTS OUT, PUT THEM IN FRONT OF A WALL THAT IS STILL STAINED WITH BLOOD, AND SHOT THEM. THE PRIESTS WERE ALSO SHOT IN THE HEAD WITH A LONG-RANGE WEAPON; HOWEVER, THESE SHOTS WERE FIRED FROM SOME DISTANCE. A LAWYER, HELPING IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THIS CASE AND WHO HAS ASKED TO REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED, SAID THAT THIS WAS DETERMINED BECAUSE THERE WERE NO GUNPOWDER MARKS ON THE VICTIMS. AT THE TIME THE CRIME WAS CARRIED OUT, A CURFEW WAS BEING OBSERVED THROUGHOUT THE CITY. AND THE HOUSE WHERE THE PRIESTS LIVED WAS SURROUNDED BY SOLDIERS. TOGETHER WITH THIS INFORMATION, GATHERED BY SEVERAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROMINENT PERSONS TO PROVE THAT THE MURDER WAS CARRIED OUT BY SOLDIERS, WE MUST STRESS THAT THE HOUSE WAS ALSO SEARCHED BY THE SOLDIERS 2 DAYS BEFORE THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED. A JESUIT PRIEST WHO WAS DESCRIBING THE SCENE SAID THAT ONLY THE AREA PREVIOUSLY SEARCHED BY THE SOLDIERS WAS DESTROYED. HE SAID THAT THE LIBRARY WAS BURNED AND THE ROOMS HAD BEEN RANSACKED. ACCORDING TO THE PRIEST, $5,000 THAT FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA HAD RECEIVED IN BARCELONA -- PART OF AN AWARD GIVEN THE UNIVERSITY -- WERE TAKEN FROM ONE OF THE ROOMS. THE USE OF LONG-RANGE WEAPONS WOULD ALSO EXPLAIN WHY THE BRAINS OF THE DEAD WERE SCATTERED ABOUT. THIS WAS SEEN BY THE FIRST PERSONS WHO ARRIVED ON THE SCENE. OTHERS SAID THAT THE BODIES WERE DESTROYED BECAUSE AK-47 AND M-16 ASSAULT RIFLES WERE USED IN THE ATTACK. THE BODIES WERE SO UTTERLY DESTROYED THAT EMBALMING WAS NOT POSSIBLE. THIS WAS REPORTED TO ACAN-EFE BY SOCIETY OF JESUS SUPERIOR JOSE MARIA TOJEIRA. REGARDING THE TWO MURDERED WOMEN, THE COOK ELBA JULIA RAMOS AND HER 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER MARISELA, ALL INDICATES THAT THEY WERE MACHINEGUNNED IN THE SMALL ROOM WHERE THEY SLEPT. THERE WAS SO MUCH BLOOD THAT IT SEEPED UNDER THE DOOR, AND A VERTEBRA AND PIECES OF A SKULL CAN STILL BE SEEN UNDER A SOFA IN THE SMALL ROOM. THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS SEEM TO INDICATE THAT THE VICTIMS WERE NOT TORTURED AS EARLIER REPORTS HAD STATED. MEANWHILE, SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI REPORTEDLY SAID YESTERDAY THAT THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND HAS NOT RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE KILLERS OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS COULD HAVE BEEN SOLDIERS. THEY HAVE NOT RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT SOLDIERS COULD HAVE KILLED THE PRIESTS, AND THEY ARE DETERMINED TO INVESTIGATE THE INCIDENT AND PUNISH THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. THIS WAS SAID BY THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT IN STATEMENTS TO ACAN-EFE AND OTHER FOREIGN NEWS AGENCIES. CRISTIANI, WHO INSISTED ON THE NEED TO AVOID UNFOUNDED CONCLUSIONS, ADDED THAT THE MILITARY DOES NOT THINK IT WILL BE AFFECTED BY SOMETHING DONE BY INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF THE INSTITUTION. WE CAN CLEARLY SEE NOW THAT THERE ARE SOME CONTRADICTIONS. AT THIS MOMENT THERE ARE THREE POSITIONS. THERE IS THE POSITION OF U.S. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER -- HE IS LIKE AN OSTRICH WITH ITS HEAD BURIED IN THE SAND. THERE IS PROOF THAT RULES OUT ALL DOUBT. HOW CAN 40 MEN IN UNIFORM BE IN A MILITARIZED AREA FOR 60 MINUTES AND NOT HEAR SHOTS BEING FIRED AND BOMBS EXPLODING? WHY DID THE ARMY NOT SEND IN TROOPS TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED ONLY A FEW BLOCKS FROM COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE'S OFFICE? THE 40 MEN WERE IN THE AREA FOR A WHOLE HOUR. THEY HAD ALREADY SEARCHED FATHER ELLACURIA'S HOME. OUR QUESTION FOR WILLIAM WALKER: IF THIS WAS NOT DONE BY THE ARMED FORCES, THEN WHY WERE THEY THERE SEARCHING THE PREMISES FOR A WHOLE HOUR AND EVEN STEALING $5,000? THEY SEARCHED DRAWER BY DRAWER. THE DISORDER THEY LEFT BEHIND WAS QUITE EVIDENT IN THE CLIPS SHOWN ON TELEVISION. THEY SEARCHED THE AREA FOR AN HOUR TO SEE WHAT THEY, THE MURDERERS, COULD FIND TO STEAL. HOWEVER, AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER SAYS THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW IF THE ARMY COMMITTED THE CRIME.
DEV-MUC3-0824	CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- AS WE SAID EARLIER, THERE ARE THREE POSITIONS. THIS PROVES THAT THERE ARE CONTRADICTIONS SURROUNDING THIS CASE. THERE IS WILLIAM WALKER, ACTING LIKE AN OSTRICH WITH HIS HEAD STUCK IN THE GROUND. AND THERE IS CRISTIANI'S POSITION -- THE DEATH SQUAD MEMBER WHO WEARS A TIE, WHO AFTER THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY , AND WHO SAID THAT RASH JUDGMENT SHOULD NOT BE PASSED AND THAT NO ONE SHOULD BE IN A HURRY TO ACCUSE THE GOVERNMENT OR ANYONE ELSE. AND THERE IS ALSO THE GENERAL STAFF AND DEFENSE MINISTRY POSITION BLAMING THE FMLN. WHY? IF IT IS TRUE THAT THERE IS A CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT IN EL SALVADOR, THEN WHY CAN THE DEFENSE MINISTER APPEAR BEFORE THE TELEVISION CAMERAS CONTRADICTING CRISTIANI, GOING AGAINST WHAT CRISTIANI HAD SAID? WHO GIVES THE ORDERS HERE, LARIOS OR CRISTIANI? IF CRISTIANI GIVES THE ORDERS, THEN THE DEFENSE MINISTER MUST OBEY CRISTIANI AND REFRAIN FROM MAKING ACCUSATIONS BEFORE A SERIOUS INVESTIGATION IS HELD. HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT THE CASE. THIS FURTHER PROVES WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SAYING. THE CIVILIAN MASK FELL ON SATURDAY. THE DEFENSE MINISTRY HOLDS THE REAL POWER IN THE COUNTRY. THE DEFENSE MINISTRY CENSORS THE PRESS. THE SOLDIERS ARE THE ONES CENSORING THE TELEVISION STATIONS, AND NOT THE ARENA FOLLOWERS OR OTHER CIVILIANS. THE GENERAL STAFF, THE SOLDIERS, ARE GAGGING THE PRESS, IMPOSING THE STATE OF SIEGE, GIVING THE FINAL ORDERS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO LOOK INTO THIS CLOSELY BECAUSE GEN LARIOS, IN AN EMPTY SPEECH -- WE HEARD HIM DELIVER A RHETORICAL AND EMPTY SPEECH -- ACCUSED THE FMLN OF KILLING THE PRIESTS AND SAID THAT THE ARMY CONTROLS THE COUNTRY. WE POINT OUT THESE CONTRADICTIONS . BY SAYING THAT THEY DID NOT DO IT, THAT THE ARMED FORCES DID NOT DO IT, THE DEFENSE MINISTER ADMITTED THAT HE DID IT, THAT HE IS ONE OF THE KILLERS. THAT IS WHAT GEN LARIOS IS SAYING, THAT IS WHAT HE SAID IN HIS PUBLIC STATEMENT. NO DOUBT, AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS . WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE GOVERNMENT'S INVESTIGATIONS BECAUSE WE HAVE PAST EXAMPLES OF IT. WE HAVE MONSIGNOR ROMERO'S CASE AND WE HAVE THE CASE OF THE REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT LEADERS, WHO, A FEW YEARS AGO, WERE ARRESTED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT DURING A POLICE OPERATION. HOWEVER, NOT A SINGLE SOLDIER HAS BEEN PUNISHED. WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN CRISTIANI'S JUSTICE. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS PUTTING ON THE PRESSURE AND CRISTIANI WILL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. HE WILL PROBABLY PUT UP SOME ACT. THE U.S. CONGRESS ALSO HAS ITS EYES ON EL SALVADOR. THEY ARE DEBATING THE ISSUE OF AID TO EL SALVADOR. THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THE U.S. CONGRESS MUST THINK ABOUT. THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE SAID THAT IT IS PLEASED WITH THE WAY CRISTIANI ACTED IN THE FACE OF THE FMLN OFFENSIVE. THIS MEANS THAT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE HAS APPROVED THE DROPPING OF WHITE PHOSPHORUS OVER ZACAMIL AND THE DESTRUCTION OF 500 HOMES. THIS MEANS THAT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE HAS APPROVED THE KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, AND ALSO THE MASSACRE OF SEVERAL SALVADORAN CITIZENS WHO WERE TAKEN FROM THEIR HOMES AND KILLED ON THE SAME BLACK NIGHT WHEN THE JESUIT PRIESTS WERE KILLED.
DEV-MUC3-0825	SAN SALVADOR, 20 NOV 89 -- RELIABLE SOURCES HAVE INFORMED THE NATIONAL NETWORK THAT GUILLERMO ROJAS, THE LEFTIST TRADE UNION LEADER, DIED IN SOYAPANGO MUNICIPALITY WHERE HEAVY COMBAT BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN ARMY AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT CRIMINAL TERRORISTS HAS TAKEN PLACE. GUILLERMO ROJAS WAS ONE OF THE TOP LEADERS OF THE TRADE UNION OF SALVADORAN SOCIAL SECURITY INSTITUTE WORKERS, STISS, AND FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE LEFTIST UNTS , A FRONT FOR THE MARXIST-LENINIST FMLN GROUPS. THE SOURCES ADDED THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING GUILLERMO ROJAS' DEATH HAVE YET TO BE CLARIFIED.
DEV-MUC3-0826	CLANDESTINE, 20 NOV 89 -- HERE IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT THAT U.S. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER SHOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. AMBASSADOR WALKER SEEMS TO BE A VERY BAD INVESTIGATOR, AS HE IS STILL IN THE DARK AS REGARDS THE COWARDLY MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS. AFTER THE FUNERAL OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE U.S. AMBASSADOR STILL EXPRESSED DOUBTS REGARDING THE AUTHORS OF THIS CRIME. WELL, WE HAVE RECEIVED A REPORT STATING THAT THE MURDERERS OF THE JESUITS FIRED MORE THAN 500 SHOTS AND STAYED IN THE RESIDENCE OF THE SLAIN PRIESTS FOR 1 HOUR. IN OTHER WORDS, 40 MEN IN THE UNIFORM OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY WERE A FEW BLOCKS FROM THE GENERAL STAFF PARTICIPATING IN SHOOTING THAT LASTED SEVERAL MINUTES, AND REMAINED IN THERE FOR 1 HOUR, IN AN AREA UNDER THE ARMY'S CONTROL, IN AN AREA UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE GENERAL STAFF. WE HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE U.S. AMBASSADOR. HOW COULD 40 MEN IN SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES UNIFORMS, AND WITH POLICE AND ARMY PATROLS ONLY A FEW METERS AWAY FROM THE JESUITS' RESIDENCE, REMAIN IN THAT PLACE FOR 1 HOUR IF THEY WERE NOT MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES? AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER, IF YOU STILL HAVE ANY SHAME, TELL THE WORLD AND ANSWER THIS QUESTION: IF THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF DID NOT KILL THE JESUIT PRIESTS, HOW COULD THE MURDERERS -- AS THIS INTERNATIONAL DISPATCH SAYS -- REMAIN IN THE RESIDENCE FOR 1 HOUR AFTER THE HEAVY SHOOTING, AFTER KILLING THE PRIESTS WITH MACHINEGUNS IN TRIPODS, AS THE CABLE SAYS? WE WILL READ THIS DISPATCH WHICH IS BEING READ ALL OVER THE WORLD. MAYBE WILLIAM WALKER DOES NOT EVEN READ INTERNATIONAL DISPATCHES, BECAUSE HE CYNICALLY SAID AFTER THE PRIESTS' FUNERAL THAT HE HAD NO EVIDENCE OR INDICATION THAT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED BY THE ARMED FORCES. WELL, AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER, WE WILL READ THIS DISPATCH TO YOU: THE IN UNIFORM WHO KILLED SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO COMPANIONS IN SAN SALVADOR ON THURSDAY FIRED MORE THAN 500 SHOTS AND REMAINED AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME FOR ALMOST 1 HOUR. WE REPEAT: THEY WERE IN THE PRIESTS' RESIDENCE FOR ALMOST 1 HOUR, ACCORDING TO PRIVATE INVESTIGATIONS CONDUCTED BY VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS. A FEW HOURS BEFORE THE FUNERAL, THE SCENE OF THE CRIME REVEALS SOME OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONCERNING THE MACHINEGUNNING OF THE PRIESTS.
DEV-MUC3-0827	SAN SALVADOR, 21 NOV 89 -- THE THREE SPANISH MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE BRIGADES, FREED TODAY BY THE SALVADORAN NATIONAL GUARD, SAID THAT THE AUTHORITIES ORDERED THEM TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY WERE SUSPECTED OF COLLABORATING WITH "TERRORIST DELINQUENTS." "WE ARE BEING THROWN OUT OF THE COUNTRY," SAID FRANCES RIERA, ONE OF THE SPANIARDS DETAINED THIS MORNING TOGETHER WITH HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN ESTHER DOMENECH AND LUIS PEREZ, A GUATEMALAN UNDER REFUGE AT THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH, AND ANOTHER THREE FOREIGNERS -- A COLOMBIAN, A CANADIAN, AND AN AMERICAN. RIERA SAID THEY WERE DETAINED AT 1005 GMT, WHILE THE CITY WAS "UNDER CURFEW" AND UNDER A "STATE OF SIEGE," AND THAT NATIONAL GUARD MEMBERS "KNOCKED ON THE DOOR, ENTERED, SEPARATED US, TOOK THE FOREIGNERS ASIDE, AND DELIVERED US AN ANTICOMMUNIST HARANGUE." "THEY TOLD US THEY WERE ARRESTING US FOR OUR OWN PROTECTION BECAUSE FOREIGNERS WERE BEING THREATENED BY TERRORIST DELINQUENTS. AT THE NATIONAL GUARD WE WERE MADE TO SIGN A STATEMENT IN WHICH WE APPEAR AS SUSPECTS OF COLLABORATING WITH TERRORIST DELINQUENTS," RIERA ADDED. THE THREE SPANIARDS ARE AT THE SPANISH EMBASSY, AFTER AMBASSADOR FRANCISCO CADIZ IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO ACTION TO GET THEM FREED. A TOTAL OF 15 PEOPLE WERE DETAINED, NINE OF THEM SALVADORANS, AND WE "KNOW NOTHING OF THEIR WHEREABOUTS," RIERA SAID. HE ADDED THAT THEY HAD REMAINED IN DETENTION FOR OVER 1 HOUR, STRESSING THAT "WE WERE NEVER MISTREATED NOR WERE WE ASKED ANY QUESTIONS." RIERA SAID THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN 135 PEOPLE AT THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH WHO WERE LEFT HOMELESS BY THE WAR, AND MORE ARE EXPECTED TODAY. "PEOPLE HAVE TO REMAIN THERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO PLACE TO GO. THERE ARE NO PLACES LEFT AFTER THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE BOMBINGS," RIERA STRESSED. HE ADDED THAT THE CHURCH "HAS EVIDENCE THAT WHOLE NEIGHBORHOODS WERE SET ON FIRE." RIERA REPORTED THAT AT THE END OF AUGUST "ARMED MEN, DRESSED IN MILITARY UNIFORMS," ENTERED HIS HOME AND "INTIMIDATED US." THE THREE FREED SPANIARDS WILL RETURN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO MADRID, VIA GUATEMALA, A SPOKESMAN FOR THE SPANISH EMBASSY IN SAN SALVADOR REPORTED.
DEV-MUC3-0828	HAVANA , 18 NOV 89 -- THE MAIN COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT HAS EXPRESSED SERIOUS CONCERN AT THE DIRECT U.S. INTERFERENCE IN THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT. ON FRIDAY THE NORTHERN QUARTERS OF THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL SAN SALVADOR WERE ONCE AGAIN SUBJECTED TO MASSIVE BOMBARDMENTS BY MILITARY AIRCRAFT IN WHICH U.S. PILOTS TOOK PART, A REPORT FROM THE INSURGENT "VENCEREMOS" RADIO STATION SAYS.

DEV-MUC3-0829	WASHINGTON DC , 21 NOV 89 -- PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH HAS SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES INTENDS TO CONTINUE MILITARY AND ECONOMIC AID TO EL SALVADOR, THE SCENE OF FIERCE CLASHES RECENTLY BETWEEN SALVADOREAN INSURGENTS AND THE PRO-AMERICAN REGIME'S ARMY. SPEAKING AT THE ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, MARYLAND, ON MONDAY, THE PRESIDENT STRONGLY CRITICISED THE PREVAILING CONGRESSIONAL SENTIMENTS IN FAVOUR OF THE TERMINATION OF AID TO THE SALVADOREAN GOVERNMENT. "THIS CONCEPT OF THE CONGRESS, OF SOME MEMBERS -- TALKING ABOUT CUTTING OFF AID TO EL SALVADOR IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE TO ME AS PRESIDENT." HE SAID. "WE SUPPORT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI AND HIS EFFORTS TO RESTORE ORDER," BUSH SAID. THE PRESIDENT ACCUSED THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FIGHTING FOR NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE AND DEMOCRACY, OF BEING FINANCED BY "MARXISTS". MEANWHILE THE VOLUME OF WASHINGTON'S MILITARY AND ECONOMIC AID TO THE SALVADOREAN REGIME IS KNOWN TO EXCEED 1.5 MILLION DOLLARS. "TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A HANDFUL OF COUNTRIES AROUND -- A VERY SMALL HANDFUL -- SUPPORTING THE OUTDATED CONCEPT OF MARXIST GUERRILLAS, IS UNACCEPTABLE TO THE UNITED STATES," THE PRESIDENT SAID. "AND I AM TO TELL THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES THAT I WILL NOT ACCEPT, AS PRESIDENT, A CUT OFF OF AID TO EL SALVADOR," HE SAID. THE PRESIDENT SAID "WE CANNOT CONDONE KILLING" IN EL SALVADOR, IGNORING THE FACT THAT THE NOTORIOUS "DEATH SQUADS", PARAMILITARY EXTREME RIGHT-WING FORMATIONS, HAVE KILLED SCORES OF THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. CIVILIANS, SUSPECTED OF LINKS WITH GUERRILLAS, ARE IMMEDIATELY EXECUTED, THE AMERICAN PRESS HAS REPORTED. ACCORDING TO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, THERE ARE 55 AMERICAN MILITARY ADVISERS IN EL SALVADOR, SOME OF THEM INVOLVED IN TERRORISTIC "DEATH SQUAD" OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS MANY U.S. SECRET SERVICE EMPLOYEES.

DEV-MUC3-0831	CLANDESTINE, 21 NOV 89 -- WE HAVE SEEN DISPATCHES RELEASED BY U.S. NEWS AGENCIES REPORTING THAT THE FMLN HAS TAKEN HOSTAGES.

THEREFORE, THE INFORMATION BEING RELEASED BY THE U.S. NEWS AGENCIES IS NOT TRUE. THE FMLN DOES NOT TAKE HOSTAGES. THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE SHOULD TAKE HOSTAGES, WE ARE NOT TERRORISTS. WE DO NOT HOLD FOREIGNERS HOSTAGE AS SOME U.S. NEWS AGENCIES ARE REPORTING. WE WILL BE RELEASING A COMMUNIQUE ON THIS MATTER SHORTLY. HOWEVER, WE WISH TO STATE THAT THE FMLN DOES NOT TAKE HOSTAGES. THE FOREIGN DISPATCHES RELEASED ARE GROUNDLESS. THE DISPATCHES STATE THAT THE FMLN IS HOLDING FOREIGNERS HOSTAGE. THAT IS NOT TRUE; WE DO NOT TAKE HOSTAGES, IT IS NOT OUR POLICY. WE ARE CLARIFYING THIS FOR THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. WE DO NOT WANT THEM TO BE CAUGHT OFF GUARD BY THE INFORMATION BEING RELEASED BY FOREIGN NEWS AGENCIES. THERE ARE NO HOSTAGES, TAKING HOSTAGES IS NOT OUR POLICY. IF A FOREIGN CITIZEN -- U.S. CITIZEN OR ANY OTHER FOREIGNER -- IS TRAPPED IN AREAS OF CONFLICT, THE FMLN WILL ENSURE HIS SAFETY. OUR FIGHTERS HAVE BEEN ORDERED TO PROTECT THE PHYSICAL INTEGRITY OF ANY CITIZEN AFFECTED BY THE CURRENT SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR.

THE ARMY HAS BEEN UNABLE TO ADVANCE DUE TO THE THE GUERRILLA TACTICS. AT PRESENT, OUR MEN ARE ENTERING THE AREA AND COMBING THE AREA BLOCK BY BLOCK, BECAUSE WE HAVE TOO MANY CIVILIANS IN THIS AREA. THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE IN CHURCHES AND RED CROSS BUILDINGS. OAS SECRETARY GENERAL JOAO BAENA SOARES HAS VISITED THE AREAS MOST AFFFECTED BY THE FIGHTING.

DEV-MUC3-0837	HAVANA , 21 NOV 89 -- WELL, WE BELIEVE THAT TODAY IT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO HEAR THE REMARKS OF COMRADE CASTRO OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT IN THIS PROGRAM. I CONSIDER IT PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE LATEST REPORTS WE ARE RECEIVING STATE THAT THE GUERRILLAS ARE CARRYING OUT A TACTICAL RETREAT, A TACTICAL REDEPLOYMENT. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU, CASTRO, WHAT THE OBJECTIVES BEHIND THIS TACTICAL RETREAT OR REDEPLOYMENT OF THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT ARE. [CASTRO) FOLLOWING 10 DAYS OF FIGHTING IN VARIOUS PLACES IN THE COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY IN SAN SALVADOR, WHERE THE REGIME CONDUCTED CRIMINAL BOMBINGS, GOING AS FAR AS USING PHOSPHOROUS BOMBS, AND TO AVOID FURTHER LOSS OF CIVILIAN LIVES, THAT IS, OF PEOPLE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE FIGHTING, THE FMLN HAS DECIDED TO CARRY OUT A TACTICAL RETREAT IN ORDER TO CONCENTRATE ITS FORCES TO CONTINUE TO STRIKE IN OTHER PLACES AGAINST THE ENEMY: THE SALVADORAN ARMY. CASTRO, DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE POLITICAL-MILITARY MANEUVER HAS ALREADY ENDED? NO. THE POLITICAL-MILITARY MANEUVER CONTINUES. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO OPEN AREAS FOR NEGOTIATIONS AND, IF POSSIBLE, TO CREATE CONDITIONS THAT WOULD BE CONDUCIVE TO DISLODGING THAT CRIMINAL GOVERNMENT WHICH IS TODAY MAKING OUR PEOPLE SUFFER. AFTER NEARLY 10 DAYS OF FIGHTING, DOES THE FMLN CONSIDER THAT THE OPERATION HAS ACHIEVED ITS POLITICAL OBJECTIVE? WE BELIEVE THAT THIS OPERATION HAS ACHIEVED SEVERAL OBJECTIVES. IN THE FIRST PLACE, WE HAVE SHOWN THE SALVADORAN ARMY AND THE WORLD OUR POLITICAL, MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC CAPABILITIES. THE ENEMY CLAIMED THAT WE ARE WEAK. THEY EVEN STATED THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE FMLN TO HOLD A POSITION IN SAN SALVADOR FOR 1 DAY. WE HAVE HELD MORE THAN 10 POSITIONS FOR 10 DAYS AND THEY HAD TO USE ALL OF THE SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS DELIVERED TO THEM BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TO FORCE US TO RETREAT, TO CARRY OUT A TACTICAL MANEUVER IN ORDER TO AVOID MORE DEATHS AND TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO TAKE ACTIONS IN OTHER AREAS OF THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING THE CAPITAL ITSELF. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT ONE THING: THERE IS A GROUP OF GUERRILLA FIGHTERS, OF REBEL FORCES THAT ARE RETREATING FROM THE CAPITAL. ISN'T THE SALVADORAN ARMY IN A POSITION TO SURROUND THEM, TO ANNIHILATE THEM? NO. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE ARMY TO SURROUND OR TO ANNIHILATE OUR COMRADES. WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED OUR GREAT MANEUVERING SKILLS IN THE COURSE OF THIS WAR. WE HAVE TIME AND AGAIN BROKEN SIEGES, AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO ANNIHILATE US. I REPEAT, WE HAVE JUST RETREATED IN ORDER TO RELOCATE OUR FORCES IN PLACES THAT WOULD ENABLE US TO DEAL EVEN HARDER BLOWS TO THE ENEMY.

NEVERTHELESS, THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC WISHES TO STATE THAT DESPITE THE TERRORIST AGGRESSION PREPARED BY THE FMLN AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WHILE GIVING STATEMENTS THAT IT ADVOCATES PEACE, IT IS WILLING TO CONTINUE THE SEARCH FOR PEACEFUL SOLUTIONS WITHOUT ANY KIND OF PRESSURE, IN A CIVILIZED WAY, AND WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC.
DEV-MUC3-0845	PANAMA CITY , 22 NOV 89 -- THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF CORREGIMIENTO REPRESENTATIVES, EXERCISING ITS LEGAL POWERS AND CONSIDERING: THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE ENDURING A BRUTAL VIOLATION OF THEIR MOST ELEMENTARY RIGHTS BY ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S ADMINISTRATION, THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS OPENLY INTERVENING TO SUPPORT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT'S ACTIONS AGAINST ITS PEOPLE, THAT THE MOST REACTIONARY SECTORS OF THE SALVADORAN SOCIETY ALONG WITH THE DEATH SQUADS ARE SOWING CHAOS AND MURDER AMID A CONNIVING SILENCE BY GOVERNMENTS IN THE REGION, THAT, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE EXPERIENCING ANGUISHING TIMES THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS SHOWN SOLIDARITY WITH THE STRUGGLE OF THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE, AND THAT U.S. IMPERIALISM WANTS TO REPEAT IN PANAMA THE DRAMA WHICH THE SALVADORAN NATION IS ENDURING, IT IS RESOLVED: 1. TO EXPRESS SOLIDARITY WITH THE EMBATTLED AND BRAVE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AT THIS TIME OF STRUGGLE AND SORROW BECAUSE THEY ARE DEFENDING THE INTEGRITY OF THEIR HOMELAND, 2. TO EXPRESS OUR UTMOST CONDEMNATION OF THE CRIMINAL ATTITUDE OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE MURDEROUS FORCES WHICH ARE ACTING IN FARABUNDO MARTI'S HOMELAND, 3. TO CONDEMN THE CONNIVING SILENCE OF THE GOVERNMENTS IN THE REGION WHICH STYLE THEMSELVES AS DEFENDERS OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS, 4. TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG REJECTION OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S MILITARY AND ECONOMIC INTERVENTION IN THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT, 5. TO MAKE A FRATERNAL APPEAL TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THEIR POLITICAL PROBLEM IN A CLIMATE OF BROTHERHOOD AND SOCIAL JUSTICE, AND 6. TO SEND A COPY OF THIS RESOLUTION TO THE MEDIA.
DEV-MUC3-0846	CLANDESTINE, 22 NOV 89 -- TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY: THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN, CONSIDERING THAT: 1. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S DEMAND FOR A CEASE-FIRE, AS REQUESTED BY THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL AND THE OAS SECRETARY GENERAL, THE GROUP OF EIGHT, THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE EEC, CANADA, THE SOVIET UNION, SWEDEN, AND FINLAND, IS A FAIR DEMAND FOR HUMANITARIAN AND POLITICAL REASONS AND IS AIMED AT STOPPING THE LOSS OF HUMAN LIVES AS WELL AS PREVENTING BLOODLETTING BETWEEN THE TWO SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES; 2. THE BRUTAL AERIAL AND ARTILLERY ATTACKS HAVE CAUSED MOSTLY CIVILIAN VICTIMS IN THE LOW-INCOME DISTRICTS AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THOUSANDS OF HOMES; 3. A MANHUNT HAS BEEN UNLEASHED FOR THE LEADERS AND MEMBERS OF TRADE UNIONS, RELIGIOUS AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, AND OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES, WHICH HAS RESULTED IN MURDERS, CAPTURES, SEARCHES, AND PERSECUTION, THE EXTENT OF WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO GAUGE, AND OTHER VICTIMS OF THE PERSECUTION HAVE GONE UNDERGROUND OR LEFT THE COUNTRY, GIVING RISE -- BECAUSE OF THESE ACTIONS PER SE AND THE CONCEALMENT OF TRUTH -- TO A CLIMATE OF STATE TERRORISM; 4. A POSTPONEMENT OF THE CEASE-FIRE WOULD RESULT IN FURTHER DAMAGE TO THE SALVADORAN POPULATION AND MORE ARMED CONFRONTATIONS, AND THIS WOULD NOT ALLOW CONDITIONS TO BE CREATED TO END THE WAR IN THE CITIES, THE COUNTRYSIDE, AND SAN SALVADOR'S METROPOLITAN AREA; 5. THERE ARE SECTORS IN THE ARMED FORCES, ARENA , PCN , MAC , AND IN THE UNITED STATES THAT WANT A PROLONGATION OF THE WAR AND, THEREFORE, OPPOSE A CEASE-FIRE; AND 6. WE ARE ACTING WITH FLEXIBILITY, GUIDED BY THE NATION'S PATRIOTIC INTERESTS, THE SITUATION OF TRUE EMERGENCY THAT HAS BEEN CREATED, AND THE DESIRE TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE ARMED CONFLICT, AND BECAUSE OF THE SOCIAL, MILITARY, POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC POLARIZATION, IT IS URGENT THAT ALL FORCES ACT SWIFTLY AND TAKE STEPS TO PUT A DEFINITIVE END TO THE WAR, THEREFORE: 1. WE STATE OUR IMMEDIATE ACCEPTANCE OF A CEASE-FIRE UNDER VERIFICATION BY THE UNITED NATIONS IN RESPONSE TO THE DEMAND OF THE POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND RELIGIOUS FORCES OF THE SALVADORAN NATION AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, WHICH HAVE ADDRESSED US TO PROPOSE IT.
DEV-MUC3-0847	TAIPEI , 23 NOV 89 -- THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA WEDNESDAY EXPRESSED ITS REGRETS OVER THE EL SALVADORAN SITUATION THAT HAS RESULTED FROM MILITARY ATTACKS LAUNCHED BY LEFT-WING GUERRILLAS. CHEN YU-CHU, SPOKESMAN FOR THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS , SAID THAT WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF SUCH COMMUNIST COUNTRIES AS CUBA AND NICARAGUA, THE LEFT-WING GUERRILLAS HAD LAUNCHED LARGE-SCALE MILITARY ATTACKS ON SAN SALVADOR, THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL, AND OTHER MAJOR CITIES IN AN ATTEMPT TO FORCIBLY SUBVERT THE LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT. THE ATTACKS KILLED MANY UNARMED CIVILIANS. CHEN POINTED OUT THAT THE ATROCITIES COMMITTED BY THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS HAD BEEN STRONGLY CONDEMNED BY PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD. "I ALSO REGRET AND CONDEMN THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS' BRUTAL ACTION," THE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN SAID. "WE BELIEVE THAT UNDER THE ABLE LEADERSHIP OF SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO FELEX CRISTIANI, PEACE, SECURITY AND PROSPERITY WILL BE RESTORED SOON IN EL SALVADOR," CHEN SAID. MEANWHILE, THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS DENIED A FOREIGN WIRE REPORT THAT THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA EMBASSY IN SAN SALVADOR HAD BEEN OCCUPIED BY SALVADORAN LEFTIST GUERRILLAS. ALL EMBASSY STAFF MEMBERS ARE SAFE, THE MINISTRY SAID. THE AMERICAN CABLE NEWS NETWORK REPORTED IN ITS TV NEWS CASTS THAT THE ROC EMBASSY IN SAN SALVADOR HAS BEEN OCCUPIED BY THE GUERRILLAS. THE CNN REPORT CAUSED DEEP CONCERN AT THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, WHICH IMMEDIATELY CABLED ITS OVERSEAS MISSIONS TO TRY TO CONTACT THE ROC EMBASSY IN SAN SALVADOR. THE MIAMI OFFICE OF THE COORDINATION COUNCIL FOR NORTH AMERICAN AFFAIRS WAS FINALLY ABLE TO CONTACT CHINESE AMBASSADOR TO SAN SALVADOR SHEN JEN-PIAO. ACCORDING TO AMBASSADOR SHEN'S REPORT, THE ROC EMBASSY IN SAN SALVADOR HAS NOT BEEN OCCUPIED BY THE GUERRILLAS AND ALL STAFF MEMBERS WERE SAFE. HOWEVER, THE AREA AROUND THE EMBASSY, THE AMBASSADORIAL RESIDENCY AND THE STAFF HOUSING AREA HAD BECOME A BATTLE FIELD AND THE ONLY ACCESS TO THE OUTSIDE WAS BY TELEPHONE, MOFA SAID. MOFA SAID THAT AMBASSADOR SHEN HAD ORDERED ALL STAFF MEMBERS TO STAY AT HOME AND WAIT FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS.
DEV-MUC3-0848	SAN JOSE , 22 NOV 89 -- A COLOMBIAN CITIZEN WAS CAPTURED BY THE U.S. SECRET SERVICE IN PANAMA AFTER HE PLACED A BOMB IN A MOVIE THEATER AT ONE OF THE U.S. SOUTHERN COMMAND'S MILITARY BASES.

DEV-MUC3-0849	SAN SALVADOR, 22 NOV 89 -- ATTENTION, ATTENTION, SALVADORAN PEOPLE; ATTENTION, ATTENTION, SALVADORAN PEOPLE: THE NATIONAL INFORMATION CENTER, CIN, REPORTS THAT THE TERRORIST DELINQUENTS ARE SPREADING FALSE RUMORS THAT YOU SHOULD LEAVE YOUR HOUSE BECAUSE THAT IS A MEASURE ADOPTED BY THE ARMED FORCES -- WITH THE INTENTION OF EXERTING PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSURE ON THE POPULATION. HOWEVER, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE OFFICIALLY NOTIFIED THAT THOSE ARE FALSE RUMORS BEING SPREAD BY THE FMLN . THE ARMED FORCES ARE HERE TO PROTECT THE CITIZENRY, AND NO ONE HAS BEEN ASKED TO LEAVE HIS PLACE OF RESIDENCE. SALVADORAN PEOPLE, YOUR COURAGEOUS AND HEROIC ARMED FORCES ARE HERE TO CONTINUE DEFENDING YOU FROM THAT COWARDLY AND SAVAGE FMLN AGGRESSION.

LONG LIVE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE! LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC!
DEV-MUC3-0850	SANTIAGO, 22 NOV 89 -- CHILE HAS RESUMED DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH CZECHOESLOVAKIA AS OF WEDNESDAY, 22 NOVEMBER .

DEV-MUC3-0851	CLANDESTINE, 22 NOV 89 -- MR. WALKER, WHEN WILL YOU TELL YOUR PRESIDENT BUSH TO STOP BEING SO RUDE. HE HAS BEEN TALKING TOO MUCH. HEAR YOUR OWN PEOPLE SPEAK DEMANDING PEACE. THIS IS NOT RIGHT. IS THIS IS THE DEMOCRACY YOU PEOPLE WANT TO EXIST HERE? BUT YOU PEOPLE ARE WRONG, MR. WALKER. IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE HERE BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ARE A VOLCANO IN ERUPTION. WHOEVER PUTS HIS HAND IN THE FIRE WILL GET BURNED, MR. WALKER. STOP STICKING YOUR NOSE INTO SOMEONE ELSE'S BUSINESS. YOU SHOULD RATHER SEND AWAY, ONCE AND FOR ALL, THOSE COUNTRYMEN OF YOURS WHO HAVE BEEN SENT HERE AS ADVISERS. THEY ARE ADVISERS, ALL RIGHT, BUT OF THE DEATH SQUADS. I HAVE JUST ONE PIECE OF ADVICE FOR YOU. UNDERSTAND ONCE AND FOR ALL THAT WHOEVER PUTS HIS HAND IN THE FIRE WILL GET BURNED. THE LAVA OF THIS ERUPTING VOLCANO IS BOILING, MR. WALKER. UNDERSTAND THAT THE PEOPLE WILL NOT TAKE ONE STEP BACK. ALL FOR PEACE. WE HAVE BEEN READING THE SUMMARY OF OUR NEWS MONITORING. U.S. PENTAGON MILITARY OFFICIALS AND MANY NONMILITARY ANALYSTS ARE SURPRISED OVER WHAT THEY CALL THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S OFFENSIVE CAPABILITIES. A REPORT STATES THAT PENTAGON OFFICIALS ARE VERY SURPRISED OVER THE FMLN MANEUVERABILITY AND OFFENSIVE CAPABILITIES. THE FMLN ACTIONS OF THE PAST DAYS HAS SPOILED ALL THE INTELLIGENCE REPORTS THAT SALVADORAN MILITARY MEN SENT TO U.S. OFFICIALS CONTAINING INFORMATION ON THE FMLN MANPOWER-WEAPONS RATIO AND OUR MILITARY ABILITY TO OPERATE. THE FMLN HAS NEVER LOST ITS MILITARY CAPABILITIES. SOME ANALYSTS VIEW THE SALVADORAN WAR AS A WAR BETWEEN TWO ARMIES. THAT IS A MISTAKE BECAUSE THE SALVADORAN WAR IS NOT A WAR BETWEEN TWO ARMIES. IT CANNOT BE VIEWED AS IF IT WERE A REGULAR WAR SUCH AS THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR. EL SALVADOR IS LIVING THROUGH CONFLICT THAT IS MAINLY SOCIAL IN NATURE, A CONFLICT THAT IS ROOTED IN SOCIAL INJUSTICE. THE FMLN DID NOT EMERGE FROM A MILITARY SCHOOL WITH A REARGUARD IN ANOTHER COUNTRY, BUT IT IS MADE UP OF THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES. FMLN COMBATANTS HAVE LEARNED TO FIGHT IN ACTUAL CLASHES. THEY HAVE GAINED GROUND INCH BY INCH; IT HAS ORGANIZED THE PEOPLE. THE FMLN DOES NOT FORCEFULLY RECRUIT PEOPLE. THEREFORE, IT IS NOT PERIODICALLY RENEWING ITS RANKS AS THE ARMY DOES THROUGH FORCEFUL RECRUITMENT. TO THE FMLN, THE MAIN GOAL IS TO ORGANIZE THE PEOPLE, TO GET AS CLOSE AS IT CAN TO THE PEOPLE. BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS, SOCIAL INJUSTICE, AND LACK OF DEMOCRATIC OPPORTUNITIES IN SALVADOR, THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS HAVE NO OTHER OPTION THAN TO TAKE UP ARMS AND FIGHT TO ACHIEVE BETTER LIVING CONDITIONS IN THE FACE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S BRUTAL REPRESSION, ECONOMIC INJUSTICE, AND UNEMPLOYMENT. TO CHANGE THIS SITUATION, THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS DECIDED TO TAKE UP ARMS AND LEARN TO WAGE WAR BY FIGHTING DAIILY. THAT IS THE HISTORY OF THE FMLN. THEREFORE, IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT TWO ARMIES ARE FIGHTING EACH OTHER. THE LOGISTICS APPARATUS OF THE FASCIST GOVERNMENT' FORCES IS NOT COMPARABLE TO OUR FORCES. THEY BRING TO OUR COUNTRY TONS OF BOMBS, RIFLES, BOOTS, AND MATERIAL THROUGH PORTS AND MILITARY AIRPORTS. ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENTS OF NICARAGUA, CUBA, AND THE USSR COULD HELP THE FMLN, AS MANY ARE SAYING, THE FIREPOWER OF OUR FORCES COULD NEVER BE COMPARED TO THE ARMY'S. NEVERTHELESS, THE FMLN HAS OPENED IN ALL COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE STATES, THE NECESSARY WAYS FOR US TO OBTAIN OUR ARMS AND AMMUNITION. WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO THIS. HOW DOES THE FMLN LEARN TO FIGHT-- BY FIGHTING. WE ARE NOW FIGHTING IN CITIES. EVERY MILITARY ANALYST KNOWS HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO FIGHT IN URBAN AREAS. THE FMLN FIGHTING IN SAN SALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL, ZACATECOLUCA, AND USULUTAN HAS SHOWN THE ORGANIZATION'S TREMENDOUS ABILITY TO WEAR OUT THE ENEMY, TAKE AND HOLD POSITIONS, AND MANEUVER IN THE CITY JUST AS IT HAS DONE IN RURAL AREAS. THE FMLN ABILITY HAS SURPRISED THE MILITARY ANALYSTS AT THE PENTAGON. OUR FRONT HAS ALWAYS HAD THIS ABILITY. BUT NOW WE HAVE CHANGED OUR STRATEGY AND TACTICS TO DEFEAT THE ENEMY PLANS. THE FORCES HAVE A SPECIFIC PLAN REGARDING THE ACTIONS BY PATROLS , SPECIAL OPERATIONS. THE FMLN HAD TO CHANGE ITS STRATEGY TO STRIKE AT THE SMALL FORCES THAT TRIED TO INFILTRATE OUR ZONE UNDER COVER. ONLY THUS COULD WE ANNIHILATE AND DEFEAT THESE FORCES AND THEIR STRATEGY. AND THIS IS WHAT WE DID. THIS IS WHAT MUST BE OBSERVED, HOW THE FMLN HAS CHANGED ITS MILITARY STRATEGY TO FACE THE ONE USED BY THE FORCES. OF COURSE, WE HAVE ACCUMULATED GREAT EXPERIENCE OVER THE YEARS, WHICH WE HAVE APPLIED THESE LAST DAYS IN COMBAT IN SALVADOR AND MIGUEL. ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS ARE BEING DESTROYED IN STREETS AND AVENUES; HELICOPTERS ARE BEING SHOT DOWN; SOLDIERS ARE BEING TAKEN PRISONER; AND ARMS ARE BEING SEIZED. MILITARY ANALYSTS ARE WONDERING HOW A GUERRILLA ARMY CAN OPERATE FOR SO LONG IN AN URBAN AREA. IN ADDITION, LOGISTICS MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. THE FORCES ARE CONSTANTLY GETTING AMMUNITION THROUGH THE ILOPANGO BASE. THE FMLN HAS BEEN ABLE TO CARRY OUT THIS OPERATION BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE'S SUPPORT. THOUSANDS OF CAPITAL RESIDENTS COOPERATED BY KEEPING SILENT WHEN THEY SAW THE GUERRILLA COLUMNS PASS BY. THEY DID NOT WARN THE FORCES. WHY? BECAUSE THE PEOPLE SEE IN THESE GUERRILLA COLUMNS THEIR OWN ARMY.
DEV-MUC3-0852	SAN SALVADOR, 23 NOV 89 -- COMMENTING ON THE NEW END TO HOSTILITIES PROPOSAL MADE BY THE GUERRILLAS LAST NIGHT, FORMER CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC DEPUTY MINISTER GERARDO LECHEVALIER TODAY SAID HIS PARTY "SUPPORTS ALL EFFORTS" SEEKING TO HALT WAR ACTIONS AND TO SEARCH FOR PEACE IN EL SALVADOR. LECHEVALIER TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS "SUPPORT ALL EFFORTS THAT WILL HELP ATTAIN SOON AND END TO HOSTILITIES, AND THE START TO NEGOTIATIONS THAT WILL BRING PEACE TO EL SALVADOR, A PEACE WE NEED SO BADLY." THE FORMER CULTURE AND COMMUNICATIONS MINISTER AND PDC LEADER SAID HE AGREES THE ARMY SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN THE NEGOTIATIONS, "TO CLEAR UP MATTERS INHERENT TO THE MILITARY -- WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS." THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT LAST NIGHT ANNOUNCED IT IS WILLING TO ACCEPT "IMMEDIATELY" A CEASE-FIRE WITH UN VERIFICATION, AND TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE ARMED FORCES THE END OF THE WAR WHICH IN THE PAST DECADE HAS LEFT OVER 70,000 KILLED. LECHEVALIER MAINTAINED THERE IS ALREADY AN AGREEMENT THAT WILL ALLOW THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE OAS TO "OVERSEE THE FAITHFUL COMPLIANCE OF THE AGREEMENTS ON A POSSIBLE CEASE-FIRE," AS ESTABLISHED IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE AGREEMENTS KNOWN AS ESQUIPULAS II.
DEV-MUC3-0853	SAN SALVADOR, 22 NOV 89 -- GENERAL JUAN RAFAEL BUSTILLO, COMMANDER OF THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE, TODAY DEFENDED THE MILITARY ACTIONS THAT THE ARMY CARRIED OUT DURING THE FMLN OFFENSIVE. THE MILITARY CHIEF SAID THAT IF THERE HAS BEEN DRASTIC ACTION AGAINST THE FMLN REBELS, IT HAS ONLY BEEN TO DEFEND THE CIVILIANS FROM WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS A FOREIGN AGGRESSION. IN THIS WAY, GEN BUSTILLO REPLIED TO STATEMENTS BY SAN SALVADOR ARCHBISHOP ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS, WHO SAID THE ARMY'S RESPONSE TO THE FMLN OFFENSIVE IN SAN SALVADOR WAS EXCESSIVE. MANY COMMENTS CAN BE MADE BUT WHAT MUST BE ASKED IS WHY DID THE REBELS SEEK THE URBAN AREAS? WHAT IS THEIR JUSTIFICATION? THAT IS THE CONDEMNABLE ASPECT. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THE MEDIA SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED ABOUT WHETHER WE ACTED STRONGLY AS MSGR RIVERA Y DAMAS SAID. IT IS TRUE WE HAVE BEEN STRONG AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE STRONG. BUT WE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THE TERRORISTS BEGAN THE ACTION, THAT IS HOW THE PROBLEM BEGAN. THAT IS WHAT MUST BE JUDGED AND NOT HOW WE REACTED. GEN BUSTILLO SAID THE MAIN ROLE OF THE AIR FORCE IS THE DEFENSE OF THE FATHERLAND. HE ADDED: THERE IS NO ROOM HERE FOR GUERRILLAS AND MUCH LESS FOR THOSE OF THE FMLN WHO CALL THEMSELVES DEFENDERS OF THE PEOPLE. GEN BUSTILLO SAID THIS FMLN OFFENSIVE WAS NOT PREPARED IN THE LAST FEW DAYS. INSTEAD, HE SAID, IT MUST HAVE BEEN PREPARED AT LEAST 18 MONTHS AGO. HE SAID IT HAS TAKEN TIME TO OUST THE REBELS BECAUSE THE ARMED FORCES HAVE NOT WANTED TO HARM THE CIVILIAN POPULATION, AMONG WHICH THE INSURGENTS HID. IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO ANNIHILATE THESE TERRORISTS WHEN THEY TAKE PEOPLE AS HOSTAGES. THAT IS WHY FOR YEARS THEY BEGAN INFILTRATING AND ESTABLISHING THE MEANS TO USE THE PEOPLE AS A COVER. WE CAN SEE THAT WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING IN THE MOUNTAINS AND THE VILLAGES FOR THE PAST 9 YEARS, THEY HAVE NOW CARRIED OUT HERE IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER BIG CITIES. THEY HAVE TAKEN COVER BEHIND THE PEOPLE, AND THAT IS WHY IT HAS BEEN VERY HARD AND DIFFICULT FOR US TO ANNIHILATE THEM. WE HAD TO BE CAREFUL SO AS TO CAUSE THE LEAST HARM TO THE PEOPLE. HE ALSO SAID THE SEIZURE OF THE SHERATON HOTEL IS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT THAT ONLY SEEKS INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION. BUSTILLO SAID A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION HAS JUST BEEN A GAME FOR THE REBELS SO NO ONE IN EL SALVADOR SHOULD CONSIDER IT AS A SOLUTION TO A 10-YEAR-OLD WAR THAT HAS LEFT MORE THAN 60,000 DEAD. THE DIALOGUE AND A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION HAVE BEEN A TACTIC USED BY THE FMLN FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WE CAN NOW CLEARLY SEE THAT NEITHER THE PEOPLE, ARMED FORCES, NOR THE POLITICIANS SHOULD CONSIDER THEM AS AN ALTERNATIVE. IT CAN BE CLEARLY SEEN THAT ALL THIS TIME DURING WHICH SOME INDIVIDUALS OF THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN SEEKING A SOLUTION THROUGH DIALOGUE, THE FMLN HAD JUST BEEN PREPARING FOR THIS OFFENSIVE. ASKED WHAT PLANS THE ARMED FORCES HAVE IN THE FACE OF ANOTHER FMLN OFFENSIVE, THE GENERAL WAS EMPHATIC: ANNIHILATE THEM. ANNIHILATE THEM. THAT IS THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO. THE GENERAL MADE THESE STATEMENTS TO THIS NEWSCAST AFTER HE LISTED THE WEAPONS THAT WERE SEIZED AND THE CASUALTIES SUSTAINED BY THE ARMY. BUSTILLO SAID FOUR OFFICERS OF THE PARATROOPERS BATTALION WERE KILLED AND SEVERAL WERE WOUNDED. HE SAID 20 SOLDIERS DIED IN THE MILITARY ACTIONS .
DEV-MUC3-0854	BOGOTA, 23 NOV 89 -- GENERAL MIGUEL ANTONIO GOMEZ PADILLA, NATIONAL POLICE DIRECTOR, REPORTED TODAY THAT PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, NUMBER ONE IN THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, AND ONE OF THE OCHOA BROTHERS, ALSO A KINGPIN IN THE GROUP, ARE APPARENTLEY SURROUNDED AND SHOULD BE CAPTURED ANY TIME. GENERAL PADILLA TOLD REPORTERS AT 1500 GMT TODAY THAT THE SEARCH FOR SOME OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL LEADERS HAD BEEN INTENSIFIED IN THE PAST 2 DAYS SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA IN COLOMBIA'S NORTHERN CENTER. HE REFUSED TO IDENTIFY THE PLACE SO AS NOT TO HAMPER THE OPERATIONS. HE ALSO SAID THAT THE SEARCH IS BEING CONDUCTED BY THE POLICE'S ELITE GROUP, SUPPORTED BY ARMY AND AIR FORCE TROOPS. GEN PADILLA SAID: "FOR THE PAST 2 DAYS, SPECIAL ELITE POLICE MEMBERS, SUPPORTED BY THE AIR FORCE AND MILITARY UNITS, HAVE CONFRONTED DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN THE SEARCH FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING CAPOS WHO WILL BE CAPTURED LATER." "AT THIS TIME, WE ARE OPERATING IN A SPECIFIC AREA AGAINST THE MEDELLIN CARTEL." HE ALSO SAID THAT "PABLO ESCOBAR AND ONE OF THE OCHOA BROTHERS" ARE POSSIBLY ENCIRCLED AND THAT THE CLASHES "APPARENTLY HAVE RESULTED IN TWO MEN BEING KILLED AND NUMEROUS OTHERS BEING DETAINED." THE HIGH-RANKING OFFICER ASKED NEWSMEN FOR TIME "TO COMPLETE THE ACTION AND, POSSIBLY, TO REPORT THAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED VICTORY." POLICE SOURCES SAID THAT THE OPERATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE IN THE CONCORNA MUNICIPALITY AREA, IN ANTIOQUIA'S MIDDLE MAGDALENA REGION, BETWEEN MEDELLIN AND BOGOTA, SOME 180 KM NORTHWEST OF THE COLOMBIAN CAPITAL, WHERE GUERRILLAS OF THE CAMILIST UNION - NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY ARE ALSO ACTIVE. THE MEDELLIN CARTEL IS REGARDED AS THE WORLD'S MOST IMPORTANT DRUG TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATION AND, ACCORDING TO THE U.S. POLICE, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 70 PERCENT OF THE COCAINE SMUGGLED INTO THE UNITED STATES. PABLO ESCOBAR AND JORGE LUIS OCHOA VASQUEZ, THE CARTEL'S NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO MEN, RESPECTIVELY, ARE RANKED AMONG THE WORLD'S 20 RICHEST MEN BY SPECIALIZED U.S. MAGAZINES LIKE "FORBES" AND "FORTUNE," WHICH ESTIMATE THEIR PERSONAL WEALTH AT OVER $3 BILLION. JORGE LUIS OCHOA HAS TWO BROTHERS WHO ARE ALSO REGARDED AS IMPORTANT DRUG KINGPINS.
DEV-MUC3-0855	BOGOTA, 23 NOV 89 -- PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, HEAD OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, HAS ESCAPED FROM THE COLOMBIAN POLICE TRAP WHICH WAS SET UP 2 DAYS AGO TO CAPTURE HIM, POLICE SOURCES SAID. ESCOBAR, REGARDED AS THE OPERATIONS CHIEF OF COLOMBIA'S LARGEST COCAINE - EXPORTING GROUP, FLED "VIRTUALLY IN UNDERWEAR," ONE OF THE OFFICERS IN CHARGE OF THE OPERATIONS SAID. CHIEF OF POLICE GENERAL MIGUEL PADILLA HAD EARLIER REPORTED THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKER HAD BEEN "SURROUNDED" AND THAT "HIS CAPTURE WAS IMMINENT." PADILLA ALSO SAID HE WAS "ALMOST SURE" THAT THE OPERATION, IN WHICH THE ARMY AND THE AIR FORCE ALSO PARTICIPATED, WOULD YIELD "POSITIVE RESULTS." THE COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES SURROUNDED AND RAIDED FOUR ESTATES OWNED BY ESCOBAR GAVIRIA IN THE MIDDLE REGION OF THE MAGDALENA RIVER, IN COLOMBIA'S NORTHERN CENTER. ON THE ESTATES, CALLED "LAS PALMAS," "EL ORO," "LA PAZ," AND "FLORENCIA," 50 BODYGUARDS AND 5 WOMEN WERE DETAINED. TWO UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN THE ENSUING CLASHES. THE POLICE SEIZED RIFLES, ISRAELI-MADE UZZI SUBMACHINEGUNS, AND SEVERAL GRENADES. ACCORDING TO A POLICE SOURCE, THE POLICE ELITE TROOPS HAVE CONTINUED TO COMB THE AREAS NEAR THE RAIDED ESTATES IN AN EFFORT TO TRACK THE ESCAPEES, WHO COULD INCLUDE ONE OF THE THREE OCHOA BROTHERS, WHO ARE THE CARTEL'S HEADS. THE OPERATIONS ARE BEING CONDUCTED IN THE COCORNA MUNICIPALITY, IN THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA IN ANTIOQUIA, BETWEEN MEDELLIN AND BOGOTA, 180 KM NORTHWEST FROM BOGOTA. THE MEDELLIN CARTEL IS CONSIDERED RESPONSIBLE FOR 70 PERCENT OF THE COCAINE THAT ENTERS THE UNITED STATES ILLEGALLY.
DEV-MUC3-0856	SAN SALVADOR, 23 NOV 89 -- SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI REJECTED THE PROPOSAL SUBMITTED BY THE REBELS ON 22 NOVEMBER FOR AN "IMMEDIATE" CEASE-FIRE WITH THE ARMY UNDER THE UNITED NATIONS SUPERVISION THIS AFTERNOON. "IS HARDLY SERIOUS. WE DO NOT FEEL THIS PROPOSAL HAS BEEN ADDRESSED TO THE GOVERNMENT. IT IS NOT SERIOUS. AGAIN ASSERT THAT THERE ARE TWO ARMIES. THERE IS JUST ONE ARMY IN EL SALVADOR," THE RIGHTIST PRESIDENT SAID. CRISTIANI'S STATMENTS WERE MOMENTARILY INTERRUPTED BY AN INTENSIVE AIR RAID BY SIX SALVADORAN AIR FORCE PLANES WHICH ARE BOMBING GUERRILLA POSITIONS IN THE SLOPES OF THE SAN SALVADOR VOLCANO. COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHIEF OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF, WHO WAS ACCOMPANYING CRISTIANI, ASSERTED THAT THE ARMY IS CHASING AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF "GUERRILLAS WHO ARE FLEEING IN GREAT CONFUSION."
DEV-MUC3-0857	CLANDESTINE, 23 NOV 89 -- JUST AS WE REPORTED THIS AFTERNOON, FASCIST CRISTIANI AND PONCE, THE VISIBLE HEAD OF LA TANDONA HELD A PECULIAR NEWS CONFERENCE WHICH NOT EVEN THE CUSCATLAN RADIO NETWORK EVEN DARED BROADCAST. THE NEWS CONFERENCE HAD JUST BEGUN THIS AFTERNOON WITH CRISTIANI AND SOME REPORTERS. PONCE WAS BESIDE HIM. SUDDENLY, AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED WHICH STARTLED BOTH CRISTIANI AND PONCE. THE NERVOUSNESS OF CRISTIANI AND PONCE DID NOT FADE AWAY. THEY WERE SCARED. THE REPORTERS ASKED FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THE EXPLOSION. AFTER STAMMERING FOR A WHILE, PONCE SAID IT WAS A BOMBING BY THE ARMY ON THE SLOPES OF THE SALVADOR VOLCANO. IN THE NEWS CONFERENCE, CRISTIANI REJECTED THE FMLN'S POSITION, WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS A PROPOSAL. BUT THE FMLN HAS MADE NO PROPOSAL. THE FMLN HAS BUT ECHOED THE CLAMOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS, ALL OF WHICH DEMAND A CEASE - FIRE IN THE COUNTRY. CONSEQUENTLY, CRISTIANI HAS NOT REJECTED A CEASE - FIRE PROPOSAL, BUT THE POSITION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.
DEV-MUC3-0858	TEGUCIGALPA, 23 NOV 89 -- HONDURAS TODAY DEMANDED FROM NICARAGUA THE "IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL" OF SANDINIST TROOPS CONCENTRATED ALONG COMMON BORDER AREAS AND WARNED OF ITS INTENTION TO "REPEL ANY ACTION THAT VIOLATES HONDURAS' TERRITORIAL SOVEREIGNTY AND INTEGRITY." HONDURAS, IN A NOTE SENT BY FOREIGN MINISTER CARLOS LOPEZ CONTRERAS TO HIS COLLEAGUE MIGUEL D'ESCOTO, STATED ITS "CONCERN DUE TO THE ANNOUNCEMENTS NICARAGUAN SPOKESMEN ARE MAKING ON TAKING MILITARY ACTION AGAINST THEIR ARMED OPPOSITION, WHEREVER THEY MAY BE." IN THE HONDURAN DEPARMENT OF EL PARAISO, ON THE NICARAGUAN BORDER, THERE ARE SOME 12,000 ARMED ANTI-SANDINISTS, BASED THERE SINCE 1982, WHO RESIST DEMOBILIZATION AND ARGUE THAT THERE IS NO DEMOCRACY IN NICARAGUA. TO THIS EFFECT, LOPEZ CONTRERAS POINTED OUT THAT "THE BORDER AREA THREATENED BY SANDINIST ARMY AND ARTILLERY, HOLDS SOME 15,000 HONDURANS, ALSO CAMPS OF UNARMED FORMER NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE FIGHTERS, MANY WHOM ARE CRIPPLED, WITH THEIR FAMILIES." THE HONDURAN PROTEST NOTE SAYS THAT "TO INDISCRIMINATELY BOMB THE HONDURAN CIVILIAN POPULATION WOULD BE A BARBARIC ACT, AND IF IT WERE CARRIED OUT INVOKING A SO-CALLED RIGHT TO MILITARY ACTIONS AGAINST THEIR ARMED OPPOSITION, IT WOULD BE A CONSCIOUS MASSACRE." THE FOREIGN MINISTRY WARNED THAT "THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT RESIGN ITS RIGHT TO REPEL ANY ACTION THAT VIOLATES OUR COUNTRY'S SOVEREIGNTY AND NATIONAL INTEGRITY." NEVERTHELESS, THE OFFICER CLARIFIED THAT THE HONDURAN ARMY HAS NOT MOVED ADDITIONAL TROOPS INTO THAT BORDER AREA. LOPEZ CONTRERAS INSISTED THAT THE "CONTRAS," WHO ARE AT CAMPS NEAR NICARAGUA, ARE "MOSTLY CIVILIANS AND UNARMED FORMER FIGHTERS." THE HONDURAN FOREIGN MINISTER'S STATEMENT CONTRASTED WITH THE FACT THAT THE "CONTRAS" THEMSELVES HAVE REITERATED THEIR REFUSAL TO TURN IN THEIR WEAPONS TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF SUPPORT AND VERIFICATION . THE CIAV, MADE UP BY OAS AND UN DELEGATES, WAS CREATED IN SEPTEMBER TO DIRECT THE "CONTRAS'" DEMOBILIZATION, REPATRIATION, OR RESETTLEMENT PROCESS, AGREED IN AUGUST AT THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT. THE PRESIDENTS SET THE DEMOBILIZATION DATE FOR 5 DECEMBER. THE TALKS ON THIS TOPIC, HELD IN WASHINGTON BETWEEN THE "CONTRAS" AND THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT, SPONSORD BY THE CIAV, AND IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HONDURAN DELEGATES, WERE SUSPENDED INDEFINITELY ON WEDNESDAY. FORESEEING "POSSIBLE INCIDENTS," THE HONDURAN FOREIGN MINISTRY SAID IT HAS INFORMED OF THE OAS AND UN SECRETARIES GENERAL.
DEV-MUC3-0859	NO CITY, NO DATE -- CRISTIANI EMPHASIZED THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE CAPABLE OF COUNTERING ANY AGGRESSION ON THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. HE ALSO TERMED AS A COMPLETE FAILURE THE TERRORIST OFFENSIVE, WHICH WAS SPURNED BY THE CITIZENRY, ADDING THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAD HARSHLY CRITICIZED THE FMLN'S TERRORIST ACTIONS. "LET US SAY THAT THE ARMED FORCES AND THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT ARE PREPARED TO MILITARILY COUNTER THE AGGRESSION FOR AS LONG AS THE FMLN WANTS TO. THE FMLN DECIDED TO LAUNCH AN OFFENSIVE BECAUSE IT THOUGHT THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SUPPORTED IT THE PEOPLE HAVE SPURNED IT ONCE AGAIN. THE ONLY THING THE FMLN HAS MANAGED TO ACHIEVE IS TO EARN THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S SCORN." "WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT A CEASE-FIRE AND NEGOTIATE A CEASE-FIRE BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE ENDING OF HOSTILITIES SHOULD BE THE FIRST GESTURE BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN TALK TO THE FMLN. IF THIS DOES NOT OCCUR, I DO NOT THINK THAT ONE SINGLE SALVADORAN WILL TRUST THE FMLN IN THE LEAST . WE, MEANING THE ARMED FORCES AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC, DO NOT WANT TO ." THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE CURFEW WILL BE MODIFIED, PARTICULARLY IN PLACES WHERE ORDER HAS BEEN COMPLETELY RESTORED. HE ALSO EXPLAINED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT HAS NEVER SOUGHT A MILITARY SOLUTION TO THE ARMED CONFLICT BECAUSE THAT IS CLARIFIED IN THE CONSTITUTION. CRISTIANI "WE HAVE NEVER SOUGHT A MILITARY SOLUTION. THE FMLN IS THE ONE WHICH HAS OPTED FOR A MILITARY SOLUTION. WE HAVE NOT GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC WITH WEAPONS AND WE HAVE NOT SOUGHT THE ARMED FORCES TO DO IT. THE FMLN IS THE ONLY ONE TRYING TO SEIZE POWER WITH ITS WEAPONS. THE ARMED FORCES HAS ONLY FULFILLED ITS DUTY, WHICH IS TO COUNTER AN ARMED ACTION." "FURTHERMORE, WE BELIEVE THAT THIS AGGRESSION IS NICARAGUA AND CUBA, BECAUSE NICARAGUA AND CUBA THE FMLN WOULD HAVE NO POSSIBILITY OF PEACE IN EL SALVADOR." THE PRESIDENT ASSERTED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE WITH THE DIALOGUE PROCESS BUT IT MUST BE FULLY CONVINCED THAT THE REBEL GROUPS ARE WILLING TO PUT DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND JOIN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN A PEACEFUL AND VOLUNTARY WAY. HE EXPLAINED THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA, WAS LIMITED TO NOTIFYING HIS COUNTERPART, CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, ABOUT THE SALVADORAN SITUATION AND REASSERTING THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION GIVEN THE FMLN DELEGATION'S ABSENCE -- WHICH CONFIRMED THEIR LACK OF WILLINGNESS TO ACHIEVE PEACE.
DEV-MUC3-0860	CLANDESTINE, 23 NOV 89 -- WHENEVER WE HAVE MADE ANY PEACE PROPOSAL, THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT ANSWERS BY SAYING IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE PEACE AND THAT OUR PROPOSALS ARE NOT FEASIBLE BECAUSE WE MUST RESPECT THE CONSTITUTION. THAT IS WHAT ARENA ALWAYS SAYS. WELL, WE WOULD LIKE TO ASK WILLIAM WALKER -- WHO HAS SAID IN THE UNITED STATES THAT THE FMLN PEACE PROPOSALS ARE NOT FEASIBLE BECAUSE THEY VIOLATE THE SALVADORAN CONSTITUTION -- IF THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT PROHIBIT FOREIGN TROOPS FROM COMING TO OUR COUNTRY WITHOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S APPROVAL? WE WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY WHY U.S. ARMY SPECIAL FORCES CAME TO EL SALVADOR, AS PRESIDENT BUSH HIMSELF ANNOUNCED? WE SAW THESE SPECIAL FORCES IN THE STREETS OF SAN SALVADOR, VIOLATING THE CONSTITUTION THAT YOU PEOPLE CLAIM TO DEFEND. WE WANT TO ASK THE PATRIOTIC OFFICIALS: WHY ARE THERE THREE ARMIES RIGHT NOW IN THIS COUNTRY? THERE IS THE FMLN ARMY, THE LA TANDONA ARMY, AND PRESIDENT BUSH'S ARMY. SO, WHAT IS THE ANSWER? WHENEVER WE PROPOSE A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT, WE ARE TOLD IT IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE IT VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTION. HOWEVER, PRESIDENT BUSH VIOLATED THE CONSTITUTION THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY CLAIM TO DEFEND WHEN HE SENT A FOREIGN MILITARY FORCE TO THIS COUNTRY. HE ALSO VIOLATED THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THIS NATION. THEREFORE, GENTLEMEN OF ARENA AND OF THE HIGH COMMAND, THIS LOVE FOR THE CONSTITUTION AND THE LAWS THAT YOU CLAIM TO HAVE IS FALSE. WE WANT TO ASK COLONEL PONCE: WHY IS THERE A FOREIGN MILITARY FORCE IN OUR COUNTRY RIGHT NOW? DOESN'T THE CONSTITUTION THAT YOUR ARMED FORCES CLAIM TO RESPECT PROHIBIT IT? IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN THE NATION WANTS A POLITICAL SOLUTION FOR THE SAKE OF PEACE, YOU PEOPLE SAY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE WE MUST RESPECT THE CONSTITUTION. HOWEVER, WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH ARROGANTLY ANNOUNCES IN HIS PRESIDENTIAL PLANE THAT HIS FORCES HAVE CARRIED OUT OPERATIONS IN A SAN SALVADOR HOTEL, THEN THE CONSTITUTION IS WORTH NOTHING. WE WANT TO APPEAL TO THE ARMED FORCES OFFICERS TO THINK ABOUT THIS SITUATION. THERE ARE OFFICERS BEING KILLED ON THE BATTLEFIELDS. FOR EXAMPLE, AN OFFICER FROM THE MORAZAN BATTALION DIED IN ALTOS DE LA CUEVA IN SAN MIGUEL; LIEUTENANTS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN SAN SALVADOR CITY; DOZENS OF LIEUTENANTS HAVE BEEN WOUNDED OR KILLED IN THE LAST 10 DAYS. OFFICERS, YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS. SO WE WANT TO CALL ON THE LIEUTENANTS, THE CAPTAINS, THE PATRIOTIC OFFICERS, TO THINK ABOUT THIS SITUATION. YOU ARE BEING TOLD YOU ARE DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION. WHAT CONSTITUTION? AFTER ALL, A HERD OF GRINGO RAMBOS IS HERE; AND WITH THEIR YANKEE BOOTS, THEY HAVE TRAMPLED ON THE CONSTITUTION. SO OFFICERS, WHAT ARE YOU DEFENDING? WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS? THIS SITUATION IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR ANY SALVADORAN PATRIOT. OFFICERS, WE KNOW YOU ARE LISTENING TO US IN THE GARRISONS TO FIND OUT WHAT IS HAPPENING, BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT NETWORK IS HIDING THIS INFORMATION FROM YOU. YOU MUST THINK OVER THIS SITUATION, OFFICERS. YOU ARE SHEDDING BLOOD, LOSING ARMS AND LEGS IN THE BATTLEFIELDS, SACRIFICING YOUR LIVES, SEEING HOW THE CAPITAL CITY IS BEING DESTROYED BY THE BOMBINGS, AND YOU ARE TOLD THIS IS BEING DONE TO DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION. HOWEVER, MR BUSH DECIDED TO SEND A HERD OF RAMBOS WHO ARE GOOD FOR NOTHING. AFTER ALL, THEY DID NOTHING, EXCEPT COVER THEIR FACES LIKE COMMON CRIMINALS. SO, OFFICERS, WHAT ARE YOU FIGHTING FOR? WHAT IS AT STAKE HERE? IS IT COMMUNISM, OR THIS OR THAT? IS IT BECAUSE MSGR ROMERO WAS A COMMUNIST AND THEREFORE MURDERED? WAS IT BECAUSE THE JESUITS WERE COMMUNISTS AND THEREFORE MURDERED? NOW IT IS SAID THAT THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBERS ARE COMMUNISTS. OTHERS SAY THAT THE JOURNALISTS, THE TEACHERS ARE COMMUNISTS; EVERYONE IS A COMMUNIST. IS THIS A NATION OF COMMUNISTS? WHAT IS THIS? WE MUST START TO THINK ABOUT THIS SITUATION AT THIS CRITICAL HOUR FOR THE NATION.
DEV-MUC3-0861	MEXICO CITY , 18 NOV 89 -- MEXICO BITTERLY CONDEMNED FRIDAY THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS THURSDAY IN EL SALVADOR, SAID A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE SECRETARIAT OF FOREIGN RELATIONS . THE SRE COMMUNIQUE UNDERLINED THAT PRESIDENT CARLOS SALINAS DE GORTARI'S ADMINISTRATION ALSO EXPRESSES ITS CONSTERNATION AND PROFOUND CONCERN FOR THE CURRENT SITUATION IN THAT CENTRAL AMERICAN NATION. "WHAT HAS RECENTLY OCCURRED IN EL SALVADOR PROVES THE URGENT NEED FOR A CEASE FIRE AND THE BEGINNING OF DIRECT CONVERSATIONS IN SEARCH OF PEACE, AS HAS BEEN CALLED FOR BY OTHER CENTRAL AMERICAN NATIONS IN THE ESQUIPULAS AND TELA PEACE ACCORDS," INDICATED THE RELEASE.
DEV-MUC3-0862	MEXICO CITY , 23 NOV 89 -- THE MEXICAN SECRETARIAT OF FOREIGN RELATIONS HAS REITERATED THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT'S CONCERN ABOUT THE BLOODSHED AND THE ATMOSPHERE OF VIOLENCE IN EL SALVADOR AND IT HAS URGED THE PARTIES CONCERNED TO RETURN TO THE PATH OF DIALOGUE AND AGREEMENT. IN A COMMUNIQUE, THE FOREIGN SECRETARIAT CONVEYS MEXICO'S CALL TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN NATIONS TO MEET AGAIN TO PROMOTE AND TO STRENGTHEN DIALOGUE AND CONCILIATION WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ESQUIPULAS AND TELA AGREEMENTS. THE COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT MEXICO WILL SUPPLY, THROUGH THE RED CROSS, MEDICAL ASSISTANCE AND FOOD TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO MITIGATE THE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES PROVOKED BY THIS CONFLICT. THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS THAT THE 2 WEEKS OF SERIOUS FIGHTINGS HAVE NOT BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN CREATING EITHER THE CONDITIONS OR THE ATMOSPHERE CONDUCIVE TO THE RESUMPTION OF THE DIALOGUE THAT WAS INITIATED IN MEXICO AND COSTA RICA. THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT STATES THAT THE SERIOUS POLITICAL SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR IS A CAUSE FOR GREAT CONCERN FOR LATIN AMERICA BOTH FROM A REGIONAL AND HUMANITARIAN STANDPOINT.
DEV-MUC3-0863	TEGUCIGALPA, 24 NOV 89 -- THE INFORMATION AND PRESS DIRECTORATE OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS MINISTRY HEREBY PUBLISHES A NOTE SENT TO NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER MIGUEL D'ESCOTO BY FOREIGN RELATIONS MINISTER CARLOS LOPEZ CONTRERAS. THE TEXT OF THE NOTE READS. NOTE NO. 122-DSM TEGUCIGALPA, 23 NOVEMBER 1989 HIS EXCELLENCY MR MIGUEL D'ESCOTO BROCKMANN FOREIGN MINISTER MANAGUA, NICARAGUA MR MINISTER: MY GOVERNMENT HAS NOTED WITH GREAT CONCERN THE CONCENTRATION OF NICARAGUAN TROOPS AT VARIOUS POINTS OF THE BORDER WITH HONDURAS, AS WELL AS THE ANNOUNCEMENTS MADE BY NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT SPOKESMEN ABOUT BEGINNING MILITARY ACTIONS AGAINST THEIR ARMED OPPOSITION, REGARDLESS OF LOCATION. TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE DANGER REPRESENTED BY THE CONCENTRATION OF TROOPS AT THE BORDER, MY GOVERNMENT HEREBY WARNS THAT IT IS A VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, PARTICULARLY TO INTER-AMERICAN LAW, TO RESORT TO THREATS OR THE USE OF FORCE AND TO VIOLATE THE SOVERIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF OTHER STATES. AS YOUR GOVERNMENT IS FULLY AWARE OF -- AND THIS HAS BEEN VERIFIED BY ON-SITE INSPECTIONS BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF SUPPORT AND VERIFICATION -- APPROXIMATELY 15,000 HONDURANS LIVE IN THE BORDER SECTOR CURRENTLY THREATENED BY THE SANDINIST PEOPLE'S ARMY AND ARTILLERY. THE SECURITY OF THOSE CITIZENS IS THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY OF MY GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER, IN THAT SECTOR THERE ARE CAMPS OF DISARMED FORMER COMBATANTS FROM THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE . MANY OF THEM ARE WAR CRIPPLED AND THEIR RELATIVES, MOST OF WHOM ARE CHILDREN, WOMEN, AND THE ELDERLY. TO CARRY OUT INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS AGAINST THE HONDURAN CIVILIAN POPULATION AND TO VIOLATE THAT SECTOR OF HONDURAN TERRITORY WOULD BE A BARBARIC ACTION AGAINST HUMANITY. IF YOU ARE REFERRING TO AN ALLEGED RIGHT TO CARY OUT MILITARY ACTIONS AGAINST YOUR ARMED OPPOSITION "NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE," I REMIND YOU THAT THIS WOULD BE AN INTENTIONAL MASSACRE, BECAUSE MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THAT AREA ARE CIVILIANS AND THE REST ARE DISARMED FORMER COMBATANTS. THIS SITUATION HAS BEEN VERIFIED BY THE CIAV. THEREFORE, MY GOVERNMENT DEMANDS THE IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL OF THE NICARAGUAN TROOPS CONCENTRATED IN THE BORDER AREAS WITH HONDURAS. UP UNTIL THIS TIME, THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT HAS NOT INCREASED THE NUMBER OF TROOPS WHO REGULARLY COMPOSE THE BORDER SECURITY FORCES. NEVERTHELESS, MY GOVERNMENT IS NOT GIVING UP ITS RIGHT TO REPEL ANY ACTION THAT VIOLATES HONDURAN SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND TO CARRY OUT THE CONSULTATIONS IT DEEMS NECESSARY, TO ADOPT THE INDIVIDUAL OR COLLECTIVE DEFENSE MEASURES THE SITUATION REQUIRES. MY GOVERNMENT ALSO WANTS TO STATE THAT IT VIEWS WITH ASTONISHMENT THE PROPOSAL PRESENTED BY THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT TO THE COUNTERREVOLUTION -- DURING THE TALKS PROMOTED BY THE CIAV IN THE UNITED STATES -- IN THE SENSE THAT THE NICARAGUAN INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICT BE SOLVED BY WITHDRAWING THE ARMED OPPOSITION TO HONDURAS. THIS PROPOSAL CLEARLY VIOLATES THE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENT AND THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED AT THE TELA SUMMIT, WHICH CONTAIN PROVISIONS FOR DEMOCRATIZATION, NATIONAL RECONCILIATION, DEMOBILIZATION, AND REPATRIATION.
DEV-MUC3-0864	PANAMA CITY , 21 NOV 89 -- THE ABOMINABLE ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO OTHER PERSONS IN EL SALVADOR DRAMATIZES THE TRAGEDY THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING. DECADES OF MILITARY DICTATORSHIP AND SOCIAL INJUSTICE HAVE CREATED A VICIOUS CYCLE OF VIOLENCE THAT HAS TAKEN AND CONTINUES TO TAKE THOUSANDS OF LIVES. FROM THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS, WE PANAMANIANS ARE HORRIFIED OVER THIS TRAGEDY. WE HOPE OUR SALVADORAN BROTHERS WILL FIND PEACE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BY EXAMINING AND BROADENING THROUGH A DIALOGUE THE DEMOCRATIZATION THAT THEY HAVE COURAGEOUSLY UNDERTAKEN IN RECENT YEARS. UPON REFLECTING ON EL SALVADOR'S BLOODY EXPERIENCE, WE DEMAND NOW, MORE THAN EVER BEFORE, THAT THE CURRENT PANAMANIAN REGIME IMMEDIATELY BEGIN THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIZATION IN OUR COUNTRY SO THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE RECONCILIATION AMONG OURSELVES BEFORE A CYCLE OF FRATRICIDAL VIOLENCE IS ESTABLISHED AMONG US. PANAMA, 16 NOVEMBER 1989 GUILLERMO ENDARA GALIMANY, PRESIDENT-ELECT; DR RICARDO ARIAS CALDERON, FIRST VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT; GUILLERMO FORD, SECOND VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT.
DEV-MUC3-0865	SAN SALVADOR, 24 NOV 89 -- ATTORNEY GENERAL MAURICIO COLORADO, INVESTIGATING THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS IN EL SALVADOR, SAID TODAY THAT THE DECLARATIONS MADE SO FAR, AMONG THEM THOSE MADE BY LUCIA BARRERA CERNA, ONE OF THE MAIN WITNESSES, "ARE NOT CONCLUSIVE, NOR HAVE THEY SHED ANY LIGHT" ON THE IDENTITY OF THE KILLERS." THE JESUITS, FIVE SPANIARDS AND ONE SALVADORAN, WERE MURDERED 9 DAYS AGO BY A GROUP OF MEN WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS DURING A "CURFEW" DECREED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS A RESULT OF THE REBEL OFFENSIVE THAT BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER. LUCIA BARRERA, WHO TESTIFIED BEFORE COLORADO, A GOVERNMENT COMMISSION INVESTIGATING THE MURDERS, AND SEVERAL DIPLOMATS, AMONG THEM SPANISH AMBASSADOR FRANCISCO CADIZ, SAID THAT THE MURDERERS NUMBERED BETWEEN 30 AND 40 UNIDENTIFIED MEN WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS. COLORADO SAID IN A NEWS CONFERENCE THAT "THERE ARE SEVERAL WITNESSES, NONE OF WHICH HAS SHED MUCH LIGHT ON THE CASE. THEIR DECLARATIONS ARE NOT CONCLUSIVE REGARDING THIS SAD AND REGRETTABLE EVENT." HE STRESSED "THAT IT WOULD BE RASH TO SAY THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMY DID IT." ACCORDING TO COLORADO, NEITHER FBI AGENTS FROM THE UNITED STATES, NOR SCOTLAND YARD AGENTS FROM GREAT BRITAIN, NOR THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT'S DELEGATES -- AS REQUESTED BY SALVDORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI WHEN HE PROMISED TO INVESTIGATE THE CASE EXHAUSTIVELY -- HAVE ARRIVED IN EL SALVADOR. HE SAID THAT THE COURT WILL SUBPOENA MARIA JULIA HERNANDEZ, DIRECTOR OF THE SAN SALVADORAN ARCHBISHOPRIC'S LEGAL AID OFFICE, "TO DECLARE WHAT SHE KNOWS, WHO TOLD HER WHAT, AND TO SAY IF SHE WAS AT THE SCENE." THE ARCHBISHOPRIC'S LEGAL AID OFFICE, A HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATION, HAS PROMISED TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION JOINTLY WITH THE JESUITS. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID THAT "WE ARE INVESTIGATING ALL CLUES," WHEN ASKED BY REPORTERS IF HE WOULD INTERROGATE THE SOLDIERS WHO WERE PATROLLING THE UNIVERSITY AREA WHERE THE MURDERS TOOK PLACE ON 16 NOVEMBER. MEANWHILE, JOSE MARIA TOJEIRA, JESUIT SUPERIOR IN CENTRAL AMERICA, SAID THAT THE MAIN WITNESS TO THE MURDERS IS "SAFE AND SOUND" ABROAD, POSSIBLY IN THE UNITED STATES. ACCORDING TO TOJEIRA, THE WITNESS, WHO WAS INTERROGATED REPEATEDLY, WAS KEPT UNDER STRICT SECURITY. HE STRESSED THAT SHE LEFT FOR AN UNKNOWN DESTINATION AND THAT SHE "IS AT EASE BECAUSE SHE HAS TOLD THE TRUTH." JESUIT SUPERIOR TOJEIRA AND ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS, ARCHBISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, HAVE ASSERTED THAT THERE IS A STRONG BELIEF THAT THE MURDERERS OF THE JESUITS WERE EITHER MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES OR PERSONS CLOSELY LINKED TO THEM. WHEN ASKED ABOUT THIS BELIEF, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL REPLIED, "I DO NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION. HOWEVER, IT WOULD BE RASH TO SAY THAT THE ARMY DID IT."
DEV-MUC3-0866	SEOUL , 22 NOV 89 -- AT A TIME WHEN THE WORLD'S ATTENTION IS RIVETED ON THE DEMOCRATIZATION MOVEMENT IN EASTERN EUROPE, WE HEAR A GLOOMY NEWS REPORT THAT THE PROTRACTED CIVIL WAR BETWEEN EL SALVADOR'S GOVERNMENTAL TROOPS RECEIVING U.S. ASSISTANCE AND LEFTIST GUERRILLAS HAS RECENTLY ONCE AGAIN INTENSIFIED, AND HAS TAKEN MANY LIVES. THE SOVIET UNION IS NOW PRODDING THE COUNTRIES IN EASTERN EUROPE, WHICH WERE ONCE KNOWN AS SOVIET SATELLITES, TO DEMOCRATIZE AND TO REFORM THEIR STATE SYSTEMS; WHY DOES THE UNITED STATES INCREASE ITS MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR AND CAUSE THE CIVIL WAR TO INTENSIFY? LIKE MANY CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRIES BEFORE THEY BECAME DEMOCRATIZED, THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR IS SUCH THAT IT IS PLAGUED BY AN EXTREME FORM OF THE GAP BETWEEN RICH AND POOR, BY MILITARY DICTATORSHIP, BY RIGHT-WING TERRORISM, AND BY ABUSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS TO THE POINT WHERE IT COULD BE ENGULFED BY REVOLUTION AT ANY TIME. HOW CAN A COUNTRY WHERE MORE THAN 2.5 MILLION OUT OF A POPULATION OF 5.4 MILLION ARE ON THE BORDER OF STARVATION, AND WHERE ROUGHLY 20 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION ENJOYS 66 PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY'S GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT, BE IN PEACE? AFTER A LARGE-SCALE PEASANT UPRISING IN 1930, THE LEFTIST FORCES IN THIS COUNTRY FORMED A UNIFIED GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION IN 1980 AND BEGAN THE ARMED STRUGGLE IN EARNEST. THE OLIGARCHIC RULING CLASS, WHICH IS SAID TO CONSIST OF 15 TO 240 FAMILIES WITH HIGH INCOME, LAUNCHED A "CLEAN-UP OPERATION" AGAINST GUERRILLAS IN COLLUSION WITH THE MILITARY, AND OPENLY MASSACRED THE LEADERS OF WORKERS AND PEASANTS BY ORGANIZING AN EXTREME RIGHT-WING ASSASSINATION GROUP CALLED THE "DEATH SQUAD." THEY EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO ASSASSINATE INTELLECTUALS AND CLERGYMEN WHO CHAMPIONED SOCIAL REFORM AND HUMAN RIGHTS. FILMS SUCH AS "ROMERO" AND "SALVADOR" THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN IN OUR COUNTRY IN RECENT MONTHS ARE CLEAR EVIDENCE OF THE BRUTALITY COMMITTED BY SUCH AN ASSASSINATION GROUP. THIS GROUP WAS UNQUESTIONABLY BEHIND THE RECENT ASSASSINATIONS IN WHICH 10 LABOR UNION LEADERS WERE MERCILESSLY MASSACRED AND ANOTHER 8, INCLUDING A JESUIT PRIEST, WERE BRUTALLY KILLED. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE UNITED STATES LURKS BEHIND THE MILITARY AND RIGHT-WING FORCES THAT ARE BENT ON SUPPRESSING THOSE WHO CALL FOR SOCIAL REFORM AND RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, NOT STOPPING AT A "CLEANING UP" OF THE LEFTIST GUERRILLAS. WHILE SENDING A GROUP OF MILITARY ADVISERS TO EL SALVADOR TO HELP THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS MOP UP THE GUERRILLAS, THE UNITED STATES IS NOW ALSO SUPPLYING THE COUNTRY WITH WEAPONS, INCLUDING ASSAULT HELICOPTERS, WORTH U.S. $103 MILLION. HOW LONG WILL THE UNITED STATES RETAIN ITS OLD POLICY OF IGNORING SOCIAL REFORM AND DEMOCRATIZATION IN A NEIGHBORING COUNTRY AND OF GIVING MILITARY AID TO ITS INCOMPETENT GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO DEFEND ITS OWN INTERESTS? WITH OUR EYES ON THE DEMOCRATIZATION MOVEMENT IN EAST EUROPE, WE ARE COMPELLED TO THINK ONCE AGAIN OF THE DEMOCRATIZATION IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA, AND OF THE OUTSIDE INTERVENTION THERE BLOCKING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. DRAWING A LESSON FROM THE DEFEAT IT SUFFERED IN VIETNAM AND IN IRAN, THE UNITED STATES SHOULD CEASE INTERFERING IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF OTHER COUNTRIES.
DEV-MUC3-0867	SAN SALVADOR, 25 NOV 89 -- FOREIGNERS LINKED TO TERRORISTS WILL BE DEPORTED. IMMIGRATION GENERAL DIRECTOR COLONEL MAXIMILIANO LEIVA HAS SAID THAT FOREIGNERS ARRESTED FOR THEIR TIES TO FMLN TERRORIST GROUPS HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER TO THEIR RESPECTIVE CONSULAR REPRESENTATIVES. HE REPORTED THE ARRESTS WERE MADE BY THE TREASURY POLICE AND OTHER SECURITY ELEMENTS WHO ARE COURAGEOUSLY FIGHTING THE FMLN MURDEROUS COMMUNISTS, WHO WANT TO INSTALL A MARXIST - LENINIST GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER, THESE REBELS WILL NOT HAVE THEIR WAY. THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL BE DEPORTED TO THEIR PLACES OF ORIGIN. COL LEIVA ALSO NOTED THAT 1,100 SALVADORAN REFUGEES RETURNED RECENTLY FROM COLOMONCAGUA, HONDURAS, WITHOUT GOING THROUGH LEGAL IMMIGRATION PROCEDURES. ARRIVING WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN WERE CHILDREN -- RAGING IN AGE FROM 12 TO 13, SOME LESS THAN 7. COL LEIVA STATED THE REFUGEES BROUGHT IN MEDICAL SUPPLIES, AND THEIR PLAN IS TO HELP THE TERRORIST CRIMINALS IN THEIR AGGRESSION AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.
DEV-MUC3-0868	SAN SALVADOR, 24 NOV 89 -- "THE FMLN USED TUPAC AMARU, VIETNAMESE, SANDINIST, AND OTHER GUERRILLA WARFARE OFFENSIVE TACTICS IN ITS OFFENSIVE," PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINTS CHIEFS OF STAFF OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, STATED 23 NOVEMBER. HE REPORTED THAT THE FMLN OFFENSIVE RESULTED IN 1,484 GUERRILLAS AND 284 SOLDIERS KILLED. THE OFFICER SAID THAT GUERRILLAS WERE ENGAGED IN A TACTICAL-TYPE DIALOGUE BY ATTENDING THE MEETINGS WITH THE GOVERNMENT WHILE PREPARING FOR THE OFFENSIVE. AMONG THE WEAPONS SEIZED, WE FOUND RUSTED WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION, INDICATING THEY HAD BEEN BURIED FOR A LONG TIME. WE ALSO FOUND DOCUMENTS AND MEDICINES WITH OLDT EXPIRATION DATES." HE SAID THAT THE ARMED FORCES LEARNED ON 9 NOVEMBER ABOUT THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FMLN ON 11 NOVEMBER, BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO ACT. THAT IS WHY THE ARMED FORCES ACTED WITH CAUTION WHEN IT BEGAN, BECAUSE THE FMLN WANTED A FAR-REACHING REACTION, SOMETHING WHICH WOULD HAVE ENTAILED HUGE DAMAGE TO CIVILIANS, AND SO THE GUERRILLAS' INTENTIONS FAILED. THE TUPAC AMARU TACTIC EMPLOYED CONSISTED IN DIGGING LARGE DITCHES, AND SO THE GUERRILLAS FORCED THE PEOPLE TO DIG THEM, COL PONCE SAID. REGARDING THE BOMBINGS HEARD EAST OF THE CAPITAL DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE, COL PONCE SAID IT WAS A OPERATION TO PURSUE "A GROUP OF TERRORISTS WHO HAD BEEN LOCATED IN THE LOS CASTILLOS, SAN FRANCISCO, AND EL PROGRESO CANTONS. HOWEVER, ONLY THE FIRST CANTON WAS SHELLED BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN EVACUATED, WHICH WAS NOT THE CASE IN THE OTHER TWO CANTONS.
DEV-MUC3-0869	SAN SALVADOR, 25 NOV 89 -- THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES TODAY REPORTED THAT A PLANE LOADED WITH WEAPONS FOR GUERRILLAS COMING FROM NICARAGUA CRASHED AT DAWN TODAY IN A TOWN OF USULUTAN DEPARMENT, KILLING THREE CREWMEN WHILE A FOURTH COMMITTED "SUICIDE." THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE POINTED OUT THAT THE PLANE CRASHED AT 0025 LOCAL TIME IN A TOWN IN EL TRANSITO, EASTERN USULUTAN DEPARTMENT. ACCORDING TO COPREFA, THREE CREWMEN DIED DURING THE ACCIDENT AND A FOURTH SURVIVED, BUT COMMITTED SUICIDE AFTERWARD. THE ARMED FORCES DID NOT IDENTIFY THE CREWMEN, STATING ONLY THAT THEY WERE WEARING CAMOUFLAGE UNIFORMS. THE MILITARY SOURCE REPORTED THAT THE PLANE, A WHITE AND BLUE, RED-STRIPED TWO-MOTOR "CESSNA" BELONGS TO A COMPANY CALLED "SETA" HEADQUARTERED IN NICARAGUA. THE COPREFA REPORT, WHICH IS BASED ON THE FLIGHT SCHEDULE, STATES THAT THE PLANE LEFT MANAGUA AND WAS TO HAVE LANDED IN AMATECAMPO, LA PAZ DEPARTMENT, BUT SUFFERED AN ACCIDENT IN "PIEDRA PACHA" NEAR EL TRANSITO. COPREFA REPORTS THAT THE PLANE WAS CARRYING 24 "SAM-7" SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES, A "REDEYE" MISSILE, A 75- MM ANTITANK GUN, AND 21 ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION FOR NONRECOILLESS 75- MM CANNON. SALVADORAN ARMY TROOPS SURROUNDED THE AREA OF THE ACCIDENT AND SEIZED THE WEAPONS, THE SOURCE REPORTED. ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES HAVE ACCUSED THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT OF HELPING THE FARABUNNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT LOGISTICALLY AND WITH WEAPONS. ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SOURCES, THE OFFENSIVE THAT THE FMLN BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER, WHICH HAS YIELDED 2,000 DEAD AND THOUSANDS OF WOUNDED, WAS SUPPORTED BY NICARAGUA AND CUBA, WHICH SUPPLIED MOST OF THE WEAPONS.
DEV-MUC3-0870	SAN SALVADOR, 25 NOV 89 -- A CESSNA PLANE TRANSPORTING WEAPONS FROM MANAGUA CRASHED TODAY AT 0525 ON A SMALL LANDING STRIP IN PIEDRA PACHA CANTON, EL TRANSITO, 6 KM EAST OF USULUTAN. THE PLANE WAS CARRYING THE FOLLOWING WEAPONS FOR THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT TERRORISTS: 24 SAM-7, SOVIET-MADE SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES; 21 GRENADES FOR 75-MM CANNONS; A 75-MM ANTI-TANK CANNON; A U.S.-MADE SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE KNOWN AS THE RED-EYE; AND OTHER EQUIPMENT. THE PLANE, A WHITE AND BLUE TWIN-ENGINE CRAFT WITH RED STRIPES, WAS BEING FLOWN BY SANDINISTS. FOUR PERSONS, DRESSED IN CAMOUFLAGE WEAR, WERE KILLED AT THE SITE OF THE ACCIDENT. SOME DOCUMENTS THAT ARE BEING ANALYZED BY MILITARY INTELLIGENCE WERE ALSO FOUND AT THE SCENE. AMONG THE DOCUMENTS IS THE FLIGHT PLAN THAT SHOWS THAT THE PLANE DEPARTED FROM MANAGUA, NICARAGUA, AND ITS DESTINATION WAS EL SALVADOR. THIS PLANE WAS TO HAVE LANDED AT THE AMATICAMPO LANDING STRIP, ALONG THE LA PAZ DEPARTMENT COASTLINE. THE INFORMATION ADDS THAT THE PLANE BELONGED TO ZETA COMPANY -- OFFICES LOCATED ACROSS FROM THE CESAR AUGUSTO SANDINO AIRPORT IN MANAGUA -- AND THAT IT DEPARTED EARLY THIS MORNING FROM MANAGUA. THE AUTHORITIES ARE INVESTIGATING MORE DETAILS REGARDING THIS INCIDENT, WHICH PROVES NICARAGUA'S INTERFERENCE IN EL SALVADOR'S DOMESTIC AFFAIRS.
DEV-MUC3-0871	CLANDESTINE, 26 NOV 89 -- IN VIEW OF THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE COUNTRY'S ARMED CONFLICT AND THE ARMED FORCES' ATTITUDE, THE FMLN REPORTS THE FOLLOWING: 1. THAT THE GOVERNMENT, FAR FROM SUSPENDING, HAS INTENSIFIED BOMBINGS AND ARTILLERY ATTACKS. IT IS NOW EVEN USING 105-MM OBUS HOWITZERS IN DENSELY POPULATED AREAS. WE ARE INFORMING THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT SUCH BOMBINGS HAVE YIELDED THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES AND DESTROYED THOUSANDS OF HOMES BELONGING TO HUMBLE FAMILIES IN SAN SALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL, USULUTAN, AND ZACATECOLUCA. IN REJECTING A CEASE-FIRE, THE GOVERNMENT HAS TURNED ITS BACK ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. 2. THAT IN VIEW OF THE RUMORS THAT THE FMLN IS PLANNING TO ATTACK U.S. CITIZENS TO NOT ATTACK U.S. PERSONNEL AND INSTALLATIONS. THAT POLICY WAS EVIDENT DURING THE SHERATON HOTEL INCIDENT IN WHICH, ALTHOUGH OUR FORCES ENJOYED AN ADVANTAGE OVER THE GREEN BERETS TRAPPED IN THAT HOTEL, AND DESPITE THE PREVAILING TENSION, THEY RIGOROUSLY ADHERED TO THAT POLICY WITH DISCIPLINE. 3. THE FMLN DOES NOT ADVOCATE CAPTURING PRISONERS OR CARRYING OUT INDISCRIMINATE ARMED ACTIONS. 4. WE ALSO ALERT THE ENTIRE NATION AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ABOUT THE GENERALIZED REPRESSION BEING UNLEASHED BY THE ARENA GOVERNMENT. THAT PARTY, BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE STATE OF SIEGE AND THE MARTIAL LAW, HAS HASTILY APPROVED THE ANTITERRORIST LAW AS AN INSTRUMENT TO INSTITUTIONALIZE TERROR. THIS LAW SEEKS TO ELIMINATE THE POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT OUR PEOPLE HAVE ACHIEVED, ALL FORMS OF OPPOSITION, AND TO CONSOLIDATE A FASCIST REGIME. THIS HAS BEEN THE HISTORIC PROJECT OF ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON AND LA TANDONA WHO NOW CONTROLS THE ENTIRE MILITARY LEADERSHIP. FMLN GENERAL COMMAND COMMANDERS FRANCISCO JOVEL, SALVADOR SANCHEZ CEREN, JORGE SHAFIK HANDAL, EDUARDO SANCHO, AND JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS.
DEV-MUC3-0872	SAN SALVADOR, 26 NOV 89 -- THIS AIRCRAFT, I REPEAT, WAS CARRYING VERY SOPHISTICATED ARMAMENTS. IT CARRIED 24 SOVIET-MADE SURFACE-TO-AIR-MISSILES, ONE 75-MM RECOILLESS CANNON, GRENADES FOR THAT CANNON, AND IT ALSO HAD DOCUMENTS AND MANUALS EXPLAINING ITS USAGE. WE CAN NO LONGER CONTINUE DOING NOTHING IN VIEW OF THIS GENOCIDAL, INTERVENTIONIST ACTION, AND MORE THAN ANYTHING, A TRAITOROUS ACTION BY DANIEL ORTEGA. THAT IS WHY WE RESOLVED ON 25 NOVEMBER, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, TO MAKE THE PROPER CHARGES AGAINST ORTEGA AND HIS GOVERNMENT BEFORE THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL AND THE OAS SECURITY COUNCIL. SECOND, WE WILL SUSPEND RELATIONS, BE THEY DIPLOMATIC, COMMERCIAL, OR OF ANY SORT WITH NICARAGUA. WE WILL WITHDRAW OUR MISSION FROM NICARAGUA. THIRD, AT THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT, EL SALVADOR WILL NOT GO TO NICARAGUA. RIGHT NOW, IT WILL ASK THE OTHER THREE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTS OF THE AREA TO TRANSFER THE SITE OF THAT MEETING TO ANOTHER FRATERNAL CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY. WE WILL DEMAND THERE, BEFORE THE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES THAT THEY TRULY HONOR THE ESQUIPULAS PACT AND CONDEMN DANIEL ORTEGA FOR SUPPORTING THE FMLN WE CAN APPRECIATE, VERY FRANKLY, WHAT THE FMLN IS. THEY ARE NOTHING MORE THAN THE PUPPETS OF THE COMMUNIST AGGRESSION. MR CASTRO AND MR ORTEGA ARE RESISTING ALL OF THE CHANGES THAT ARE TAKING PLACE IN THE SOVIET UNION AND IN ALL OF THE COUNTRIES BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN WHICH ARE ATTEMPTING TO DEMOCRATIZE THEMSELVES AND GIVE THEIR PEOPLE LIBERTY. THEY ARE THE ONLY TWO WHO SEEK TO CONTINUE TO REMAIN IN POWER THROUGH THE RIFLE AND BY WAR. SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE CANNOT PERMIT OUR COUNTRY, OUR SMALL EL SALVADOR, OR OUR NOBLE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO BE THE VICTIMS OF THAT COMMUNIST AGGRESSION WHICH DANIEL ORTEGA AND FIDEL CASTRO SEEK TO LAUNCH. IN THAT SENSE, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, IN VIEW OF THIS NEW SITUATION, WE WANT YOU TO REFLECT ON THAT ARTIFICIAL CEASE-FIRE WHICH THE FMLN LAUNCHED A FEW DAYS AGO. WHAT IS THE FMLN UP TO WITH THAT CEASE-FIRE? IT MADE THAT PROPOSAL AFTER IT WAS REMOVED FROM THE CITY THAT IT HAD ATTACKED. THE PEOPLE WERE RESUMING THEIR NORMAL ACTIVITIES AND EVERYTHING WAS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE ARMED FORCES IN THOSE AREAS. WHY DID THEY CALL FOR A CEASE-FIRE WHEN THEY HAD ALREADY BEEN DEFEATED IN THE OFFENSIVE BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WHO HAD REPUDIATED THEIR TERRORIST ACTIONS? THEY HAD NO REAL OBJECTIVE AHEAD, OTHER THAN TO CONTINUE TO DESTROY, TO ASSASSINATE, AND TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE TERRORIST ACTIONS HERE IN OUR COUNTRY. THEREFORE, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT CANNOT PERMIT ITSELF TO FALL INTO ANOTHER TRAP OF THE FMLN. IF THEY WENT TO MEXICO AND COSTA RICA WITH A SINCERE DESIRE FOR PEACE, AS THEY TRIED TO MAKE US BELIEVE, WE REALIZE TODAY THAT THOSE ACTIONS WERE JUST ANOTHER FARCE. THIS AGGRESSION WAS NOT PLANNED IN 2 OR 3 DAYS. THIS AGGRESSION HAD BEEN PLANNED SEVERAL MONTHS BACK. KNOWING THAT THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, THEY HAD THE GALL TO ATTEND AND MAKE THE ENTIRE WORLD BELIEVE THAT THEY REALLY WANTED PEACE. THEREFORE, WE CANNOT, I REPEAT SALVADORAN PEOPLE, FALL INTO ANOTHER TRAP OF THE FMLN. THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO DEMAND TERRITORIAL RIGHTS IN OUR COUNTRY WHEN THEY ARE A BAND OF TERRORISTS AND ARE PUPPETS OF ORTEGA AND CASTRO. LET US SEE IF THE PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE SUPPORT, AS THEY ARE, WILL OWE ORTEGA AND CASTRO FAVORS. IF THEY SUCCEED, THEY WILL OWE LOYALTY NOT TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, BUT TO COMMUNIST DICTATORS SUCH AS DANIEL ORTEGA AND FIDEL CASTRO. THAT IS WHY THE GOVERNMENT HAS ESTABLSIHED A CLEAR POSITION.
DEV-MUC3-0873	TEGUCIGALPA, 26 NOV 89 -- SINCE THE EARLY MORNING HOURS, WE HAVE BEEN TRAVELING THROUGH THE SOUTHERN PART OF CORTES DEPARTMENT. WE REPORT THAT APPROXIMATELY 2 HOURS AGO WE ESTABLISHED CONTACT WITH SAN FRANCISCO DE YOJOA. APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES AGO WE FINISHED OUR TOUR OF SAN FRANCISCO DE YOJOA. WE WANT TO REPORT THAT THERE HAS BEEN A REGRETTABLE INCIDENT THAT WE WISH HAD NOT OCCURRED IN OUR COUNTRY DURING A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN WHICH ALL HONDURAS ARE PARTICIPATING TO ELECT THE FUTURE PRESIDENT. WE REPORT THAT CITIZEN JUSTINIANO SAGASTUME RODRIGUEZ, 42, WAS KILLED BY TWO BULLETS FIRED FROM A .22 CALIBER GUN BY A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL PARTY, WHOSE NAME IS NOT KNOWN. WE INFORM THAT MR JUSTINIANO SAGASTUME RODRIGUEZ WAS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PINU-SD AT VOTING TABLE NO. 17. APPROXIMATELY 1 HOUR AGO LEOPOLDO ULLOA FERNANDEZ, JUSTICE OF THE PEACE, IDENTIFIED HIS BODY HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO DE YOJOA.
DEV-MUC3-0874	SAN SALVADOR, 26 NOV 89 -- WE WANT PEACE BADLY AND ARE CONVINCED THAT YOU SALVADORANS ALSO WANT PEACE AND VIEW IT AS A MAJOR GOAL TO BE ACHIEVED. WE ALSO MUST BE COURAGEOUS AND ENDURE THE FMLN AGGRESSION AS WE, PARTICULARLY, YOU HAVE IN THE PAST DAYS. WE ARE WILLING TO SOLVE THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT THROUGH A DIALOGUE PROCESS. HOWEVER, WE CAN NO LONGER TRUST LIARS AND CYNICS WHO HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE PEOPLE'S DESIRE FOR PEACE AND OPPORTUNITIES GIVEN TO THEM IN AN ATTEMPT TO SIMPLY GAIN GROUND AND TIME TO REARM THEMSELVES TO ATTACK, KILL, AND DESTROY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. THIS IS WHY TODAY WE DEMAND THAT THE FMLN END ALL THEIR HOSTILITIES. THE VERIFICATION TEAM ONUCA MAY COME HERE IF THEY WANT TO, TO ENSURE THAT THE FMLN ENDS THEIR HOSTILITES AND FINDS A WAY TO INCORPORATE ITSELF TO THE SALVADORAN POLITICAL PROCESS. HOWEVER, WE WILL NEVER AGAIN ALLOW OURSELVES TO FALL INTO THE TRAP SET UP BY FMLN CYNICS WHO HAVE DECEIVED THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT LOOKING AFTER YOUR INTERESTS, BUT THOSE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM THAT ORTEGA AND FIDEL CASTRO ARE SENDING OUR WAY. SALVADORAN PEOPLE: WE MUST ASK YOU TO TRUST YOUR GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES. IT MATTERS NOT WHAT DANIEL ORTEGA PLANS TO DO OR WHAT WEAPONS HE SENDS THEM BECAUSE THE ARMED FORCES WILL BE READY TO REPEL ANY ATTACK OR ANY IRRATIONAL ACTION THAT THE FMLN MIGHT LAUNCH. YOU MUST REST ASSURED AND REALIZE THAT WE ARE WAGING A STRUGGLE FOR THE SAKE OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE; TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY FROM AGGRESSIONS, WHICH REGARDLESS OF THEIR ORIGIN, SHOULD NOT HINDER THE FREEDOM OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. WE MUST BE CONFIDENT THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES ARE A PROFESSIONAL ARMED FORCES THAT HAVE SUCCESSFULLY RESISTED, REPELLED, AND REMOVED THIS AGGRESSION THROUGH A PROFESSIONALISM THAT MUST STAND AS AN EXAMPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD TODAY. ALTHOUGH THE FMLN HAS HIDDEN BEHIND YOU, AS COWARDS DO, THE ARMED FORCES HAVE GRADUALLY AND CAREFULLY DEALT A BLOW TO THEM WHILE SAFEGUARDING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S INTERESTS. THE ONLY DESTRUCTORS HERE ARE THE FMLN FOLLOWERS; THE ONLY TERRORISTS HERE ARE FMLN FOLLOWERS. WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS TO CONTINUE IN OUR COUNTRY. SALVADORAN PEOPLE: I DO NOT WANT TO ALARM YOU. I WANT US TO GRADUALLY UNDERSTAND, AS EACH PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE FALLS INTO ITS PLACE, WHAT THE FMLN REALLY IS: A PUPPET OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM THAT IS ONLY SEEKING TO SUBJUGATE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, TAKE AWAY THEIR FREEDOMS, AND SINK THEM INTO DESTITUTION, AS ORTEGA HAS DONE TO THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE. OUR NICARAGUAN POLICY HAS AT NO TIME BEEN AGAINST THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE; OUR POLICY IS ONLY AGAINST THAT ANTIDEMOCRATIC DICTATOR CALLED ORTEGA WHO WANTS TO SPREAD DESTRUCTION AND DEATH TO OTHER COUNTRIES TO SATISFY HIS OWN GOALS OF CONSOLIDATING A TOTALITARIAN GOVERNMENT IN NICARAGUA. WE MUST BE ALERT TO ALL THE UPCOMING INFORMATION REGARDING THE NORMALIZATION OF THE SITUATION IN OUR COUNTRY AND REST ASSURED THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WILL ALSO HELP THE PEOPLE, WHO HAVE IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SUFFERED FROM THE FMLN AGGRESSION, WITH MEDICINE, FOOD, AND ESPECIALLY, THIS IS NEARLY FINALIZED, AID TO RECONSTRUCT THOSE HOMES THAT WERE DAMAGED BY THIS SAVAGE AND IRRATIONAL FMLN ACTION. SALVADORAN PEOPLE: THANK YOU VERY MUCH; GOD BLESS YOU ALL.
DEV-MUC3-0875	MANAGUA , 26 NOV 89 -- NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA HAS STATED THAT HE IS "PROUD AND HONORED" OVER SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S DECISION TO SEVER RELATIONS WITH HIS GOVERNMENT, AND DESCRIBED THE SALVADORAN CHIEF EXECUTIVE AS A "MURDERER." IN A SPEECH IN THE TOWN OF SOMOTILLO, ON THE BORDER WITH HONDURAS, ORTEGA SAID THAT THE NEWS OF HIS SALVADORAN COLLEAGUE'S ANNOUNCEMENT "FILLED ME WITH JOY BECAUSE WE WILL THUS AVOID RECEIVING THE PRESIDENT OF A GOVERNMENT THAT MURDERS PRIESTS, NUNS, AND POLITICAL LEADERS." THE NICARAGUAN CAPITAL HAS BEEN SET AS THE SITE FOR THE CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMIT SCHEDULED FOR 8-9 DECEMBER. THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT SAID THAT HE WILL ASK THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH EL SALVADOR "UNTIL THE SLAYERS OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS MURDERED IN EL SALVADOR ARE PUNISHED." THE PRIESTS WERE MURDERED ON 16 NOVEMBER.
DEV-MUC3-0876	LIMA, 24 NOV 89 -- A 2-MONTH-OLD LABOR CONFLICT INVOLVING WORKERS, WHICH IN THE PAST FEW DAYS HAS CAUSED STREET VIOLENCE IN LIMA, HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MAIN SOURCES OF CONCERN FOR THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT. THE STRIKE, WHICH WAS DECREED BY THE INTERSECTORIAL CONFEDERATION OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES , IS BEING OBSERVED BY 300,000 PUBLIC SERVANTS, WHO MAKE UP 50 PERCENT OF CITE MEMBERS. THE STRIKERS DEMAND SALARY IMPROVEMENTS, THE REINSTATEMENT OF 250 DISMISSED WORKERS, AND THE OFFICIAL RECOGNITION OF THE CITE. RULING AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE SECRETARY GENERAL LUIZ ALVA CASTRO, WHO IS ALSO THE APRA PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, REPORTED THAT TODAY HE MET WITH PRIME MINISTER GUILLERMO LARCO COX IN SEARCH FOR A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. ALVA SAID THAT "THERE IS GOOD WILL" TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT, WHICH HAS AFFECTED LARGE SECTORS OF THE POPULATION, WHO MAKE USE OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, JUSTICE, TRANSPORTATION, AND COMMUNICATION SERVICES. THE STRIKE HAS ALSO AFFECTED THE STATE, WHICH HAS FAILED TO COLLECT 70 PERCENT OF TAXES BECAUSE OF THE STRIKE BY THE TAX COLLECTORS. ALVA CASTRO SAID THAT THE PRIME MINISTER TOLD HIM THAT THERE WILL BE NO PROBLEM IN RECOGNIZING THE CITE, PROVIDED THAT THIS ORGANIZATION MEETS THE APPROPRIATE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. THERE WERE INCIDENTS IN LIMA ON 23 NOVEMBER, WHEN GROUPS OF CITE MEMBERS DEMONSTRATED IN DOWNTOWN LIMA AND WERE REPRESSED BY THE POLICE. DURING THE INCIDENTS, BOMBS WERE DETONATED, TIRES WERE BURNED, AND THE POLICE SHOT IN THE AIR. AT LEAST PERSONS DIED DURING THE INCIDENTS LAST WEEK. A UNION SOURCE TODAY SAID THAT A 15-DAY STRIKE BY 3,500 WORKERS OF THE STATE-RUN MINERO PERU COMPANY HAS CAUSED DAILY LOSSES OF $800,000. ACCORDING TO THE LABOR MINISTRY, THE STRIKES HAVE COST THE PRIVATE SECTOR 13 MILLION HOURS OF LABOR, IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT THE MINING SECTOR LOST $80 MILLION DURING 18 DAYS OF STRIKE IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER, WHILE THE FISHING SECTOR HAS LOST $150 MILLION BECAUSE OF A STRIKE THAT THE WORKERS OF THE SECTOR BEGAN 55 DAYS AGO.
DEV-MUC3-0877	MANAGUA , NO DATE -- I AM GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, AND I AM GOING TO SPEAK TO YOU FROM THE HEART. ABOUT 15 DAYS AGO, I HEARD THE NEWS THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT, THE SALVADORAN ARMY, WAS BOMBING NEIGHBORHOODS AND CITIES IN EL SALVADOR, THAT IT WAS MURDERING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. I LATER HEARD THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMY HAD MURDERED SIX JESUIT PRIESTS, AMONG THEM A PRIEST WHO HAD BEEN DEAN OF THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY HERE IN NICARAGUA. IT WAS THEN THAT I BEGAN TO THINK AND ASKED MYSELF: HOW CAN I WELCOME THE PRESIDENT OF EL SALVADOR HERE IN NICARAGUA WHEN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMIT IS HELD? WHAT A PROBLEM. A REAL PROBLEM. HOW COULD I WELCOME IN NICARAGUA THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A GOVERNMENT THAT KILLS PRIESTS AND BISHOPS, THAT KILLED MONSIGNOR ROMERO; A GOVERNMENT THAT KILLS CLERGYMEN, THAT HAS KILLED NUNS AND MEMBERS OF OTHER CHURCHES, CATHOLICS AND EVANGELISTS; A GOVERNMENT THAT KILLS WORKERS, PEASANTS, LABORERS, AND LEADERS OF POLITICAL PARTIES, THAT HAS KILLED MORE THAN 600 CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADERS. THEY WERE KILLED BY ARENA , THE RULING PARTY IN EL SALVADOR, AND THE SALVADORAN ARMY, WHICH IS THE SAME THING. I KEPT ASKING MYSELF: HOW CAN I WELCOME THEM IN NICARAGUA? IT WOULD BE LIKE WELCOMING SOMOZA. ALL I COULD COME UP WITH WAS TO FIND AN EXCUSE NOT TO HOLD THE MEETING. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE FOR THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE TO HAVE TO WELCOME AND HAVE AS A GUEST THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A GOVERNMENT THAT KILLS PRIESTS, NUNS, WORKERS, LABORERS, PEASANTS, INTELLECTUALS, PROFESSIONALS, AND WORKERS. THEREFORE, THIS NEWS MADE ME HAPPY. IT MADE ME HAPPY BECAUSE WE HAVE AVOIDED THE PROBLEM OF HAVING TO WELCOME, IN NICARAGUA, THE PRESIDENT OF THAT GOVERNMENT OF INTERNATIONAL KILLERS AND COMMON CRIMINALS. THE TRUTH IS THAT WE SHOULD FEEL PROUD. AS A NICARAGUAN I FEEL PROUD THAT THAT MURDEROUS GOVERNMENT HAS BROKEN RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA. THAT IS SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF, BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT THEY KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT WE ARE ON THE SIDE OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, ON THE SIDE OF THE SALVADORAN PEASANT, ON THE SIDE OF THE SALVADORAN WORKER, ON THE SIDE OF THE SALVADORAN CHURCH AND PRIESTS, THAT WE ARE ON THE SIDE OF PEACE, JUSTICE, AND DEMOCRACY IN EL SALVADOR, AND THAT WE OPPOSE TYRANNY IN EL SALVADOR. I CAN SEE THAT THE TIME HAS COME FOR ME TO SPEAK CLEARLY TO YOU. I BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO SPEAK CLEARLY BECAUSE DIPLOMATIC JARGON CAN SOMETIMES CONFUSE THINGS. IT IS TIME THAT WE SPEAK CLEARLY. THE LEAST THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT CAN DO IN RESPONSE TO THE ATTITUDE ASSUMED BY THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS TO ASK AND DEMAND OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND THE WORLD THAT IT BREAK RELATIONS WITH THAT MURDEROUS AND CRIMINAL GOVERNMENT UNTIL THOSE WHO KILLED THE PRIESTS HAVE BEEN PUNISHED, UNTIL THOSE WHO ARE KILLING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PUNISHED. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DEMAND. THAT IS GOING TO BE OUR ANSWER. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS UNEASY BECAUSE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN EL SALVADOR. CRISTIANI IS NO TAME DOVE. HE HAS BECOME AN ACCOMPLICE AND INSTRUMENT OF THIS POLICY OF DEATH IMPLEMENTED BY THE ARMY, BY MEN LIKE PONCE AND BUSTILLO. THEY ARE MURDEROUS GUARDSMEN JUST LIKE THOSE YOU KNEW, THE SOMOZIST GUARDSMEN. BUSTILLO, PONCE, AND A FEW OTHERS ARE JUST LIKE THAT. HOWEVER, NOT ALL OF THEM ARE LIKE THAT. THERE ARE SOME HONEST SOLDIERS IN EL SALVADOR, SOLDIERS WITH HONEST POSITIONS.
DEV-MUC3-0878	CLANDESTINE, 26 NOV 89 -- A FEW DAYS AFTER THE START OF THE FMLN OFFENSIVE, THE RESULTS ARE COMPLETELY POSITIVE. FIRST OF ALL, WE ARE SEEING THE TOTAL POLITICAL DEFEAT OF THE DEMOCRACY AND COUNTERINSURGENCY PLAN BECAUSE THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN UNMASKED AS A FASCIST DICTATORSHIP. THE U.S. COUNTERINSURGENCY MODEL TRIED TO LEGITIMIZE, THROUGH AN ELECTORAL PROCESS, A QUOTE, DEMOCRATIC, UNQUOTE, GOVERNMENT WHICH WOULD LEAVE THE GROWING POPULAR INSURGENCY IN EL SALVADOR WITH NO REASON TO EXIST. THAT MODEL HAS OVERWHELMINGLY FAILED BECAUSE, INSTEAD OF AN EVEN TIMIDLY DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT, WHAT HAS BEEN INSTALLED IS A REGIME THAT DOES NOT EVEN TOLERATE THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY, WHICH IT VIEWS AS A GREAT TRAITOR TO THE FATHERLAND. A REGIME HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED WHICH DOES NOT PERMIT THE MOST MINIMAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE FREE EXPRESSION OF THOUGHT. IT DOES NOT TOLERATE THE EXISTENCE OF AN OBJECTIVE AND INDEPENDENT NEWSCAST, SUCH AS THAT OF TELEVISION CANAL DOCE. IT IS A REGIME WHICH DEMANDS THAT THE HIGHEST LEADERS OF THE CHURCH LEAVE THE COUNTRY BECAUSE IT DOES NOT GUARANTEE THEIR SECURITY. IT IS A REGIME THAT ISSUES TOTALLY UNDEMOCRATIC LAWS AND CLOSES ALL POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES. IN SHORT, IT IS A REGIME IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY. IT IS A FASCIST REGIME WITH ALL ITS COMPONENTS. THAT IS THE FINAL RESULT OF THE U.S. EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH A COUNTERINSURGENT DEMOCRATIC REGIME IN EL SALVADOR. THE LITTLE LEGITIMACY THAT THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AT ONE POINT ENJOYED WAS DESTROYED WHEN IT HAD TO COVER UP AND PERMIT THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS TO GO UNPUNISHED, AND WHEN IT INDISCRIMINATELY BOMBED THE MORE DENSELY POPULATED AREAS OF THE COUNTRY. A FEW DAYS OF THE OFFENSIVE HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO TEAR DOWN THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE ERRONEOUS U.S. POLICY IN OUR COUNTRY. AND THE VALIDITY OF THAT POLICY HAS BEGUN TO BE SERIOUSLY QUESTIONED IN THE UNITED STATES. A SECOND GREAT ACHIEVEMENT OF THESE FIRST WEEKS OF THE OFFENSIVE HAS BEEN A RADICAL CHANGE IN THE THEATERS OF OPERATION. WE HAVE PLACED THE WAR IN ITS FINAL PHASE, IN ITS PHASE OF STRATEGIC DEFINITION. THERE HAS BEEN AN ABRUPT CHANGE IN WHAT HAD APPEARED TO BE AN ENDLESS WAR AND AN UNBREAKABLE BALANCE OF FORCES. THE TRANSFER OF THE THEATERS OF OPERATION TO THE CITIES HAS RESULTED IN A STRATEGIC SIEGE OF THE CITIES, WHICH ARE THE WEAK SPOTS OF THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL POWER. IN TURN, AS WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY POINTED OUT, THIS HAS BROUGHT ABOUT AN ACCELERATED POLITICAL BREAKDOWN OF THE REGIME.
DEV-MUC3-0879	CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- THE ENEMY IS LEFT LIKE THAT, HANGING FROM A THREAD -- A STRATEGIC THREAD WHICH CAN BREAK AT ANY MOMENT AND RESULT IN A MILITARY SETBACK FOR THE ARMY. THE PHENOMENON WHICH ENSUED AFTER THE MASSES JOINED THE OFFENSIVE IN ITS EARLY STAGES FORCED THE ENEMY TO INDISCRIMINATELY USE THE AIR FORCE TO PREVENT A GENERAL UPRISING AND TO CURTAIL THE INSURRECTION. NEVERTHELESS, THE EFFORT EXERTED TO LAUNCH A NATIONWIDE OFFENSIVE HAS BEEN BASED ON A LARGE-SCALE PEASANT AND SUBURBAN INSURRECTION PROCESS. OUR RANKS WERE CONSIDERABLY INCREASED TO RENDER THE OFFENSIVE EFFECTIVE, AND THIS WAS POSSIBLE THANKS TO THE PEOPLE'S GREAT INTEREST IN FIGHTING IN THE CITIES AND SPEEDING UP THE OUTCOME OF THE WAR. THE PEOPLE ALSO JOINED OUR RANKS DURING THE FIGHTING WHICH OCCURRED IN THE CITIES. FURTHERMORE, THE GERM OF A NEW SOCIAL EXPLOSION HAS BEEN CREATED BY THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF, WITH ITS INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS AND REPRESSION. EVEN THOUGH SOME PEOPLE MAY BLAME THE FMLN FOR THE ARMY'S BRUTAL REACTION, FEW CAN FEEL ANY SYMPATHY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BOMBED THEM. THIS HAS CREATED A SOCIAL SITUATION WHICH GUARANTEES THE CONTINUITY OF THE FMLN'S OFFENSIVE UNTIL VICTORY IS ACHIEVED. ALL THE PEOPLE DISPLACED BY THE BOMBINGS ARE DISSATISFIED PEOPLE WHO WILL JOIN THE STRUGGLE SOONER OR LATER. WE REMEMBER THE PHENOMENON OF THE DISPLACED PEOPLE AND REFUGEES CAUSED BY THE BOMBINGS IN THE SALVADORAN COUNTRYSIDE. THE BRUTAL ATTITUDE OF THE ARMY AND AIR FORCE HAS LEGITIMIZED THE ARMED STRUGGLE. THE OTHER PARTY, MEANING THE ENEMY, HAD TO GRAB ALL THE RESOURCES OF A CONVENTIONAL WAR: AIRPLANES, HELICOPTERS, AND HEAVY ARTILLERY. THIS LEGITIMIZES THE PEOPLE'S ARMED STRUGGLE AND SELF-DEFENSE. A THIRD GREAT ACHIEVEMENT OF THE NATIONAL AND STRATEGIC EFFORT EXERTED AGAINST FASCISM HAS BEEN THE LIBERATION OF LARGE ZONES OF THE NATIONAL TERRITORY. A NEW, EMERGING POWER NOW CONTROLS EIGHT DEPARTMENTS OF THE COUNTRY. THE ARMY IS SPREAD THIN AND IT HAD TO ABANDON THE ZONES WHERE IT CANNOT KEEP ITS MEN -- COMPROMISED AS IT IS IN THE STRATEGIC DEFENSE OF THE CITIES. THIS PUTS THE ARMY THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL TERRITORY IN A SITUATION RESEMBLING A CLOTH WITH MANY HOLES, STRETCHED TO THE LIMIT AND THREATENING TO RIP AT ANY POINT. THE TEAR CAN OCCUR WHEN LEAST EXPECTED. LARGE GROUPS OF PEOPLE ARE NOW IN THOSE LIBERATED TERRITORIES, ENGAGED IN A RECONSTRUCTION EFFORT AND ORGANIZING A REARGUARD FOR THE MARCH ON THE CITIES. THERE IS A FOURTH ELEMENT TO CONSIDER: ONE OF THE FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENTS IS THE FACT THAT THERE IS NOW A BETTER BALANCE FOR NEGOTIATIONS. ALL OF THE GOVERNMENT'S DEMANDS AND PROPOSALS AT THE NEGOTIATION TABLE ARE COMPLETELY NULL AND VOID. THE PRETENSE OF DEMANDING THE FMLN'S SURRENDER IS UNTIMELY GIVEN SUCH A SHOW OF STRENGTH. NO ONE IN THE WORLD WOULD NOW BE WILLING TO BET ON THAT POSITION.
DEV-MUC3-0880	CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- THERE IS NO LONGER ROOM FOR THE IDEA OF DIALOGUE WITHOUT NEGOTIATION. NOW WE MUST NEGOTIATE IN EARNEST. THAT DEMAND HAS BEEN MADE BY SEVERAL GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL FORUMS, AND EVEN BY SOME INFLUENTIAL SECTORS IN THE UNITED STATES. YET CRISTIANI HAS OPPOSED THIS UNIVERSAL CURRENT. CRISTIANI'S TACTICAL, PROPAGANDISTIC, AND DELAYING MOVES AROUND THE NEGOTIATIONS TABLE WILL NO LONGER HAVE A CHANCE TO SUCCEED. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT WILL NOW BE AN INDISPENSABLE CONDITION THAT DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION BE EXPANDED AND THAT THE REAL DECISIONMAKERS BE THE ONES WHO SIT AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE. FINALLY, FOLLOWING THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FMLN, THE ANALYSTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE UNITED STATES, HAVE ADMITTED THAT THERE IS A NEED TO CARRY OUT AN IN-DEPTH STUDY OF THE VALUE OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR. THE DEBATE ON THE CONDITIONING, AND EVEN THE TOTAL SUSPENSION, OF MILITARY AID TO THE SALVADORAN ARMY IS VERY INTENSE, AND IT HAS ALREADY SHAKEN THE FOUNDATIONS OF BIPARTISANSHIP REGARDING U.S. SUPPORT FOR THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT. YOU WILL RECALL THAT THE DEBATE HAS NOT CONTINUED BECAUSE THE U.S. CONGRESS HAS DECLARED A RECESS; HOWEVER, IT WILL SOON BECOME THE CENTER OF THE U.S. CONGRESS' DEBATES. IN SUMMARY, WE COULD SAY THAT THE ENEMY HAS LOST GROUND AND LEGITIMACY, AND THE BASIS FOR ITS SUPPORT, THE U.S. AID, IS BEING SERIOUSLY THREATENED. IN ADDITION, THE ARMY HAS BEEN REDUCED TO THE STRATEGIC DEFENSE OF AN IMPORTANT CENTER, THE CAPITAL CITY. THEREFORE, IT IS ONLY LOGICAL TO SAY THAT TODAY WE SAW A VERY WORRIED, EVEN DESPERATE, CRISTIANI. CRISTIANI'S SPEECH ON THE RADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK SHOWS AN ATTEMPT TO RETOUCH THE PICTURE. CRISTIANI TRIED TO LOWER THE LEVEL OF THE WATER THAT HAS REACHED HIS NECK BY DIVERTING THE WORLD'S ATTENTION FROM THE BOMBINGS AND THE DEATHS OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS TO NICARAGUA. IN THIS DESPERATE EFFORT, ALL THAT CRISTIANI HAS DONE IS TO TAKE THE WAR TO OTHER AND MORE DANGEROUS LEVELS. HE IS ATTEMPTING TO REGIONALIZE THE WAR, AND THIS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY ISOLATE HIM EVEN MORE FROM THE WORLD. THE OUTCOME OF THIS SITUATION DEPENDS ON ALL THESE FACTORS THAT CAN ACCELERATE THE DECOMPOSITION OF FASCISM IN THE COUNTRY. HOWEVER, THEY DEPEND MOSTLY ON THE VIGOR AND STRENGTH THAT ALL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE PLACE ON THIS ONGOING AND IRREVERSIBLE STRUGGLE.
DEV-MUC3-0881	BOGOTA, 27 NOV 89 -- AN AVIANCA BOEING 727 WITH 107 PEOPLE ON BOARD TODAY EXPLODED AT 07:18 HOURS ABOUT 22 KM SOUTH OF BOGOTA, THE EL DORADO AIRPORT CONTROL TOWER IN BOGOTA CONFIRMED. AERONAUTIC AUTHORITIES REPORTED THAT A PLANE WITH REGISTRATION NUMBER HK-1803 TRAVELING FROM BOGOTA TO CALI TOOK OFF AT 07:13 FROM THE BOGOTA AIRPORT. A FEW MINUTES LATER, WITNESSES REPORTED TO BOGOTA RADIO STATIONS THAT THE PLANE EXPLODED IN THE AIR, BROKE IN TWO, AND BURST INTO FLAMES. OCTAVIO FONSECA, A WITNESS WHO WAS NEAR WHERE THE PLANE FELL TOLD CADENA RADIAL COLOMBIANA THAT "THE PLANE EXPLODED IN THE AIR AND BROKE IN TWO." HE ADDED: "I HAVE ALREADY GONE TO WHERE THE PLANE FELL. THE PLANE IS COMPLETELY DESTROYED, NO SURVIVORS, ONLY BURNT AND MANGLED CORPSES."
DEV-MUC3-0882	CLANDESTINE, 27 NOV 89 -- ATTENTION. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION. ATTENTION. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION. AS WE HAVE ALREADY REPORTED, U.S. OFFICIALS, IMPORTANT PERSONS, AND POLITICIANS IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE ISSUED STATEMENTS AFFIRMING THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES ARE DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE CASE OF THE MURDERED JESUITS. THE TESTIMONY GIVEN BY THE LADY WHO WITNESSED THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY CRIME HAS CAUSED POLITICAL UPHEAVAL THAT IS ALSO BEING FELT IN THE CORRIDORS OF THE U.S. CONGRESS, THE WHITE HOUSE, AND THE PENTAGON. EVEN ELLIOTT ABRAMS, FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS, HAS STATED ON THE FACE THE NATION TELEVISION PROGRAM ON 27 NOVEMBER, THAT THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS, A WOMAN, AND HER DAUGHTER WAS AN ACTION BY THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES AND NOT THE FMLN . ABRAMS, A FORMER REAGAN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL, STATED: BASED ON 10 YEARS EXPERIENCE ON THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT, I PRESUME THAT THE DEATH OF THE PRIESTS WAS NOT THE WORK OF LEFTIST GUERRILLAS, BUT AN ACTION BY FORCES OF THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION. WE DO NOT HAVE A RECORD OF GUERRILLAS TAKING THIS SORT OF ACTION, SAID ELLIOT ABRAMS. HE ADDED THAT, IN THE PAST, MANY MILITARY OFFICERS HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE SO-CALLED DEATH SQUADS AND THE RIGHTIST SECTOR IN EL SALVADOR. THESE WERE THE STATEMENTS BY ELLIOT ABRAMS. VOA HAS REPORTED THE STATEMENTS BY THE WOMAN WHO WITNESSED THE CRIME. AT THIS TIME IN THE UNITED STATES, THE SALVADORAN TOP MILITARY COMMAND, COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, AND PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ARE BEING POINTED OUT AS THE PERSONS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ABOMINABLE CRIME. IN RELATION TO THIS, WE WANT TO DENOUNCE THE FOLLOWING TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA. OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS, THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION HAS TRIED TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF THE UNITED STATES THAT IS PRESENTLY CENTERED ON THE CASE OF THE MURDERED JESUITS AND THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IN THIS CRIME. WE DENOUNCE THE ARREST OF U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CAZOLO AS PART OF A SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES PLAN TO ATTEMPT TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION FROM THE JESUITS' CASE. WE ALSO DENOUNCE THE ARREST OF JENNIFER CAZOLO AS A REPRESSIVE ACT. ALSO, THE ARMED FORCES IS TRYING TO LINK HUMANITARIAN AID FOR EL SALVADOR, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND U.S.-BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO THE FMLN. IT IS TRYING TO LINK THESE ORGANIZATIONS AND THESE PERSONS TO THE FMLN. THE FMLN COMPLETELY DENIES THAT IT HAS ANY LINK WITH U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CAZOLO. WE DENOUNCE THIS ACCUSATION AS A CLUMSY SET UP BY THE ARMED FORCES COMMAND, WHICH IS TRYING -- WE REPEAT -- TRYING TO REPRESS THESE HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND FOREIGNERS. THIS IS A SET UP BY THE ARMED FORCES TO REPRESS FOREIGN CITIZENS AND -- WE REPEAT -- IT IS A SMOKE SCREEN TO DIVERT U.S. ATTENTION FROM THE CASE THAT IS PRESENTLY ON THE TABLE. IT IS A SET UP TO NOT ATTEND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S DEMAND FOR JUSTICE IN THE CASE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS. IF ELLIOT ABRAMS, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS, WHO KNOWS SO MUCH ABOUT EL SALVADOR, SAYS THAT IT WAS NOT THE FMLN AND THAT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED BY MILITARY UNITS AND PERSONS LINKED TO THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, HIS STATEMENTS WILL HAVE STRONG REPERCUSSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE ARMED FORCES COMMAND AND THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION ARE TRYING TO DO ALL THEY CAN TO THROW A SMOKESCREEN HERE AND THERE TO TRY TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND, ESPECIALLY, THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES. IN CONCLUSION, WE REAFIRM: WE DENY THE ARMED FORCES' ACCUSATIONS AGAINST U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CAZOLO. WE STATE THAT THE ACCUSATION IS A CLUMSY SET UP TO HIDE AND NOT RESPOND TO THE QUESTION EVERYONE IS ASKING -- WHERE ARE THE MURDERERS OF THE JESUITS? BEHIND THE CLUMSY SET UP WITH REGARD TO THE U.S. CITIZEN, WE ALSO SEE THAT THEY INTEND TO CONTINUE TO REPRESS HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND DIFFERENT SECTORS THAT HAVE EXPRESSED SOLIDARITY WITH EL SALVADOR. IN SHORT, ALL THIS SET UP ATTEMPTS TO DO IS THROW A HUGE SMOKESCREEN TO REPRESS THESE ORGANIZATIONS AND FOREIGNERS.
DEV-MUC3-0883	SANTIAGO, 27 NOV 89 -- THE RADIO MINERIA SANTIAGO STAFF CONTINUES TO EVALUATE THE SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE CAUSED BY A TERRORIST ATTACK AT THE OFFICES OF RADIO MINERIA. ERNANI VALDA, THE DIRECTOR OF THE RADIO STATION, HAS REPORTED THAT SO FAR THE DAMAGE IS ESTIMATED AT 2.5 MILLION PESOS. THE BOMB WAS PLACED IN THE OFFICE OF POLITICAL COMMENTATOR GERMAN GAMONAL, WHO IS ALSO THE PRESS DIRECTOR. FIVE PEOPLE WERE WORKING AT THE OFFICES WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED; ONE OF THEM WAS INJURED. WE SPOKE WITH REPORTER HERMOGENES CARRILLO, WHO ARRIVED AT THE RADIO STATION OFFICES AFTER THE ATTACK. ONE PERSON SUFFERED MINOR INJURIES AND THE OFFICES OF RADIO MINERIA WERE SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED DURING THE BOMB ATTACK HERE AT THE INTERSECTION OF PROVIDENCIA AND TOBALABA STREETS THIS MORNING AT 0510. THE RADIO STATION WAS OFF THE AIR FOR 45 MINUTES, DURING WHICH TIME CARABINEROS PERSONNEL INSPECTED THE SITE TO CONFIRM THAT THERE WERE NO OTHER BOMBS. GOPE PERSONNEL ARRIVED LATER. ACCORDING TO THEIR SPECIALIZED PERSONNEL THE BOMB CONTAINED TRONEX , AND IT HAD BEEN PLACED BY ONE OF THE WINDOWS ON PROVIDENCIA STREET. AT LEAST TWO OR THREE PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN THE ATTACK. THEY SOMEHOW CLIMBED TO THE SECOND FLOOR, PLACED THE BOMB, LIT THE FUSE, AND FLED. NO WARNING WAS RECEIVED NOR HAS ANY SUBVERSIVE MOVEMENT CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ATTACK SO FAR. WE HAVE RECEIVED TELEPHONE CALLS FROM OUR LISTENERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED IMPORTANT POLITICAL PERSONALITIES, INCLUDING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HERNAN BUCHI AND INTERIOR MINISTER CARLOS CACERES. AMONG OTHERS, WE HAVE RECEIVED A CALL FROM OSORNO FROM FRANCISCO JAVIER ERRAZURIZ AND ANOTHER CALL FROM SANTIAGO FROM RICARDO LAGOS. THIS IS ALL WE CAN REPORT FOR NOW. THE COST HAS NOT YET BEEN ESTIMATED, BUT IT WILL BE SUBSTANTIAL. THIS WAS A REPORT BY RADIO MINERIA FOR RADIO NACIONAL DE CHILE.
DEV-MUC3-0884	BOGOTA, 27 NOV 89 -- POLICE SOURCES HAVE DESCRIBED THE ANNONYMOUS TELEPHONE CALL TO RADIO CADENA CARACOL BLAMING "THE EXTRADITABLES" DRUG TRAFFICKING GROUP FOR THE EXPLOSION ON BOARD AN AVIANCA BOEING 727 AS "LACKING CREDIBILITY." THE PLANE WAS ON A FLIGHT FROM BOGOTA TO CALI WITH 107 PERSONS ABOARD. THE ANNONYMOUS CALLER SAID THAT "THE EXTRADITABLES" HAD PLANTED A BOMB ON THAT PLANE BECAUSE "FIVE INFORMERS" WERE ABOARD. HOWEVER, POLICE SOURCES CONSULTED BY EFE WERE SKEPTICAL, DESCRIBING WHAT THE ANNONYMOUS CALLER HAD SAID AS LACKING CREDIBILITY. ANOTHER POLICE SOURCE TOLD EFE THAT THE ANNONYMOUS PHONE CALL BLAMING "THE EXTRADITABLES" FOR THE EXPLOSION SOUNDED MORE LIKE A JOKE IN BAD TASTE. HE ADDED THAT THE CALL DOES NOT FOLLOW THE NORMAL PATTERN USED BY THAT GROUP WHEN CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS ACTIONS. THE GROUP USUALLY SENDS COMMUNIQUES TO THE MEDIA. THESE COMMUNIQUES ARE WRITTEN ON PAPER WITH THE GROUP'S LETTERHEAD AND ARE DULY SIGNED, AND AT TIMES INCLUDE THE FINGERPRINTS OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR SENDING THE COMMUNIQUE. A SPOKESPERSON AT EL DORADO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN BOGOTA, FROM WHERE THE PLANE TOOK OFF, SAID THAT IT WAS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR SOMEONE TO HAVE EVADED THE STRICT SECURITY AT THE AIRPORT. THE SOURCE ADDED THAT THE PASSENGERS AND THE LUGGAGE UNDERWENT ROUTINE BUT RIGOROUS SECURITY CHECKS. THESE SECURITY CHECKS INCLUDE HAND CHECKS AND THE USE OF ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT AND EXPLOSIVES-DETECTING DOGS. THE SOURCE ADDED THAT NOTHING UNUSUAL WAS NOTICED. "THE EXTRADITABLES" IS AN ARMED GROUP UNDER THE MEDELLIN CARTEL THAT FOR THE PAST 6 YEARS HAS BEEN FIGHTING AGAINST THE EXTRADITION OF COLOMBIANS TO THE UNITED STATES. UP TO NOW THE CRIMES THAT THE GROUP HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR, AND OTHERS FOR WHICH IT IS BLAMED, HAVE ALL FALLEN UNDER THE CATEGORY OF SELECTIVE MURDERS BUT NEVER AN INDISCRIMINATE ATTACK LIKE DESTROYING A PLANE. CIVIL AERONAUTICS DIRECTORATE SOURCES SAID THAT THE BLACK BOX HAS BEEN FOUND AND THAT ITS CONTENTS WILL PROBABLY REVEAL WHAT HAPPENED. THE SOURCES ADDED THAT 8 HOURS AFTER THE TRAGEDY, THERE ARE STILL NO CLUES THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO BE ABSOLUTELY SURE WHETHER THIS WAS AN ATTACK OR AN ACCIDENT. MOST OF THE PASSENGERS ON BOARD THE PLANE WERE GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE BUSINESSMEN WHO WERE TRAVELING FROM BOGOTA TO CALI, IN THE SOUTHEASTERN SECTOR OF THE COUNTRY, FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES.
DEV-MUC3-0885	MANAGUA , 27 NOV 89 -- THE ALLEGED NICARAGUAN PILOT THAT WAS KILLED IN EL SALVADOR IS ALIVE AND WELL, IN MANAGUA, TALKING WITH US. THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT SAID MAURICIO QUIROS GARCIA WAS KILLED IN AN ALLEGED TRANSSHIPMENT OF WEAPONS LAST SATURDAY, 25 NOVEMBER WHEN A CESSNA PLANE CRASHED. MAURICIO QUIROS GARCIA, 36-YEARS-OLD, IS HERE, NEXT TO ME. HE IS MARRIED AND HAS CHILDREN. GOOD EVENING, MAURICIO. GOOD EVENING. I AM SO SURPRISED AND ASTONISHED OVER THIS REPORT, THAT I REALLY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN HOW I FELT WHEN I WAS CALLED. AT FIRST, I THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE. HOWEVER, AFTER RECEIVING SEVERAL TELEPHONE CALLS FROM SEVERAL NEWSMEN, I STARTED TO THINK SERIOUSLY ABOUT THIS. I WANT TO CLARIFY AND EXPLAIN THAT THIS REPORT IS TOTALLY FALSE. MAURICIO, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT SAYS YOU ARE A FORMER PILOT OF THE SANDINIST AIR FORCE, FAS. IS THAT TRUE? THAT IS TRUE. I WAS IN THE FAS FOR 2 YEARS, AND NOW, I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH AERONICA FOR THE LAST 8 YEARS. WHAT TYPES OF FLIGHTS DO YOU MAKE? TO WHERE DO YOU FLY AND FROM WHERE? THEY ARE INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS. I AM THE CAPTAIN OF A BOEING 727. WE FLY TO PANAMA CITY; SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA; MEXICO CITY, AND GUATEMALA CITY. WHERE DID YOU GO TO SCHOOL? IN MEXICO. WERE YOU EVER INVOLVED WITH THE FMLN , ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH ANY TYPE OF WEAPONS? THE REPORTS MENTION SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT. DID YOU JUST UNLOAD ALL THAT IN EL SALVADOR, AND TURNED AROUND SO QUICKLY, THAT YOU WERE IN SEVERAL PLACES ON SATURDAY? I DO NOT HAVE THE SLIGHTEST NOTION ABOUT SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS, OR ANYTHING ELSE. MY JOB IS TO PILOT A PLANE, AND THAT IS WHAT I DO; I PILOT THE AERONICA PLANE AND THAT IS IT. MAURICIO, DO YOU KNOW THE FMLN WELL? NO, I DO NOT KNOW ANYONE FROM THE FMLN. I HAVE NO RELATIONS WITH ANYONE LINKED AT ALL TO THE FMLN. SO WHY SHOULD ANYONE WANT TO REPORT THAT YOU WERE KILLED EARLY IN THE MORNING IN USULUTAN DEPARTMENT? WELL, AS I SAID BEFORE, THAT REPORT HAS SURPRISED ME. FRANKLY SPEAKING, I DO NOT KNOW. THIS SHOWS THAT CERTAIN GOVERNMENTS SOMETIMES ISSUE TOTALLY FALSE REPORTS IN ORDER TO HIDE OR, I DO NOT KNOW THAT REPORT IS TOTALLY FALSE. THAT IS ALL I CAN SAY. AS YOU CAN SEE, I AM VERY CONCERNED, AND JUST AS SURPRISED AS YOU ARE.
DEV-MUC3-0886	MANAGUA , 27 NOV 89 -- EL SALVADOR HAS CARRIED OUT A CONSTANT AND PERMANENT AGGRESSION AGAINST NICARAGUA AND NICARAGUA HAS NEVER SUGGESTED BREAKING RELATIONS WITH EL SALVADOR. NICARAGUA HAS NOT EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT BREAKING RELATIONS WITH HONDURAS. ON THE CONTRARY, WE HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO FOLLOW A POLICY OF NEGOTIATIONS TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. I DO NOT BELIEVE IN FOOLING OURSELVES. THE REAL PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS MADE A COMMITMENT, AND THAT COMMITMENT MUST BE FULFILLED. THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS MADE A COMMITMENT TO MOBILIZE THE CONTRAS; THAT COMMITMENT MUST BE FULFILLED. THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ALSO COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS IN CENTRAL AMERICA, AND THAT COMMITMENT MUST ALSO BE FULFILLED. EL SALVADOR MUST FULFILL THAT COMMITMENT. THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS NOT RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS IN EL SALVADOR, THEY ARE KILLING PEOPLE IN EL SALVADOR, THEY HAVE BOMBED THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THEY HAVE KILLED THE JESUIT PRIESTS. IN LIGHT OF ALL THIS, THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT MUST EXPRESS ITS SOLIDARITY WITH THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE; THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE THE ONES WHO ARE SUFFERING. WE CANNOT BE IN SOLIDARITY WITH AN ARMY THAT IS KILLING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. LET US WAIT AND SEE HOW MANY GOVERNMENTS WILL SUPPORT THAT ARMY WHICH IS KILLING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AN ARMY THAT IS BOMBING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AN ARMY THAT HAS KILLED THE JESUIT PRIESTS. LET US WAIT AND SEE HOW MANY GOVERNMENTS WILL SUPPORT THE ARMY. I ASSURE YOU THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD, ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD WILL EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. SHORTLY BEFORE COMING HERE THIS EVENING, I WAS WATCHING THE NEWS VIA SATELLITE, AND I SAW PROTEST DEMOSTRATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE PEOPLE ARE PROTESTING THE KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE BOMBINGS IN EL SALVADOR. CHRISTIANS, CATHOLICS, CLERGYMEN, AND PRIESTS ARE PROTESTING IN THE UNITED STATES . THEREFORE, OUR POSITION IS QUITE CLEAR. WE DO NOT RENOUNCE THE PEACE AGREEMENTS. WE CONTINUE TO DEFEND THEM, AND WE WILL DEMAND THAT THE AGREEMENTS BE FULFILLED. WE ARE GOING TO DEMAND THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT RESPECT THOSE AGREEMENTS AND RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS. WHAT IS NEEDED IN EL SALVADOR IS A CEASE-FIRE. A REAL CEASE-FIRE AND NEGOTIATIONS ARE NEEDED IN EL SALVADOR TO REACH AN AGREEMENT THAT WILL ALLOW PEACE AND DEMOCRACY IN EL SALVADOR. NO ONE CAN BE HAPPY WITH THAT KIND OF A DEMOCRATIC REGIME -- LIKE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DESCRIBE IT. THAT GOVERNMENT IS KNOWN FOR KILLING PEOPLE, FOR KILLING CLERGYMEN. HUMAN RIGHTS MUST BE RESPECTED IN EL SALVADOR. I AM GRATEFUL TO ALL THE COMRADES WHO CAME FROM THE VARIOUS REGIONS TO BE HERE TONIGHT TO ATTEND THIS MEETING DURING WHICH, IN ADDITION TO DISCUSSING SEVERAL MATTERS OF INTEREST FOR ALL THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE, WE ALSO HONORED OUR EVANGELISTIC BROTHERS WHO HAVE WORKED HERE IN NICARAGUA FOR THE PAST 7 YEARS AND GAVE POSTHUMOUS RECOGNITION TO OUR JESUIT BROTHERS, THE PRIESTS BRUTALLY MURDERED IN EL SALVADOR. WE ARE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE CHRISTIAN PEOPLE, THE PREACHERS OF THE GOSPEL, THE EVANGELISTS AND ALL THE CHURCHES IN OUR COUNTRY, FOR A NICARAGUA IN PEACE AND DEMOCRACY. ONCE AGAIN I WISH TO REITERATE: BETWEEN CHRISTIANITY AND REVOLUTION, THERE IS NO CONTRADICTION.
DEV-MUC3-0887	MOSCOW , 27 NOV 89 -- THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS REJETED THE PROPOSAL FOR AN IMMEDIATE CEASE-FIRE THAT THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT , ACCORDING TO MAURICIO SANDOVAL, SALVADORAN MINISTER OF CULTURE AND COMMUNICATIONS. SANDOVAL WAS INTERVIEWED BY THE U.S. NEWS AGENCY UPI. THE SALVADORAN PATRIOTS MADE THIS PROPOSAL IN RESPONSE TO THE OAS RECOMMENDATION REGARDING THE SALVADORAN SITUATION. THE RECOMMENDATION CALLS FOR AN IMMEDIATE RETURN TO NEGOTIATIONS. BISHOP GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ OFFERED HIS GOOD OFFICES. VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ HAS ALSO JOINED THE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO STOP THE VIOLENCE IN EL SALVADOR. ON TUESDAY, 21 NOVEMBER, PEREZ MET WITH OFFICIALS OF THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, NAMELY JUSTICE MINISTER OSCAR SANTAMARIA AND MINISTER OF PRESIDENCY JUAN PADELA. ACCORDING TO CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, HE ALSO TALKED WITH HIS SALVADORAN COUNTERPART ALFREDO CRISTIANI ON THE PHONE. IN THE COURSE OF THIS TALK HE OFFERED TO HOST A CARACAS MEETING BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS. IT WOULD SEEM THAT BECAUSE OF THE NEGATIVE ATTITUDE OF CRISTIANI'S ADMINISTRATION, ALL THESE EFFORTS HAVE NOT YIELDED THE EXPECTED FRUITS. THE FACT IS THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO WORSEN THE TERROR. WITH THIS IN MIND, THE GOVERNMENT IS DRAFTING A LAW TO PUNISH THE OPPOSITION. AS A PREVENTIVE MEASURE, CONGRESS HAS ALREADY APPROVED ANTITERRORIST BILLS. THESE BILLS ALLOW THE ARREST OF PEOPLE ON SUSPICION OF ANTIGOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES. A SALVADORAN DEPUTY HAS LABELED THESE BILLS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND CONTRARY TO HUMAN RIGHTS. MEANWHILE, THESE BILLS HAVE ENCOURAGED THE ACURSED DEATH SQUADS. AMERICAS WATCH, A HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION, HAS REPORTED AN INCREASE OF , ARRESTS OF AND THREATS AGAINST FOREIGNERS WHO WORK FOR RELIGIOUS AND HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS IN EL SALVADOR. THE SALVADORAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION BELIEVES THAT THE CRUSADE AGAINST FOREIGN MISSIONARIES IS ENCOURAGED BY THE ULTRARIGHTISTS WHO ARE OPERATING UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE GOVERNMENT. THE GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES THE REACTIONARIES THEIR IMPUNITY. DEATH SQUADS, WORKING CLOSELY WITH REACTIONARY MILITARY MEN AND THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, ARE MOST CERTAINLY TO BLAME FOR THE RECENT DISGRACEFUL MURDER OF SIX PRIESTS IN EL SALVADOR, ACCORDING TO THE U.S. PUBLICATION THE BOSTON GLOBE. THE PAPER STATES THAT THIS IS OBVIOUS TO ALL AND THAT THE SALVADORAN REGIME AND THE YANKEE GOVERNMENT ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT REFUSE TO ADMIT IT. FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW THIS ATTITUDE IS REASONABLE. WASHINGTON'S POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR IS BASED ON THE ULTRARIGTHWING FORCES . THE BOSTON GLOBE ADDS THAT EVERY YEAR THE TAXPAYERS TAKE OUT OF THEIR POCKETS $500 MILLION TO FINANCE THE ASSISTANCE THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT GIVES TO EL SALVADOR. SOME OF THIS MONEY GOES TO THE DEATH SQUADS WHICH ARE GUILTY OF THOUSANDS OF MURDERS COMMITED AMID HELLISH TORTURES. IT IS A SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF INFORMATION. THE THING IS THAT U.S. OFFICIALS PREFER TO LASH OUT AT THE FICTITIOUS SHIPMENTS OF SOVIET WEAPONS TO EL SALVADOR, FICTITIOUS BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN NONE AT ALL. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE USE THAT SUCCESSIVE SALVADORAN REGIMES HAVE MADE OF U.S. AID, HAS ALWAYS BEEN DOWNPLAYED. HOWEVER, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT WITHOUT THE HEFTY U.S. SUBSIDIES, THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT WOULD HAVE BEEN RESOLVED A LONG TIME AGO AND THE NEARLY 100,000 SALVADORANS WHO HAVE DIED IN THE STRUGGLE, WOULD STILL BE ALIVE.
DEV-MUC3-0888	MOSCOW , 22 NOV 89 -- ACCORDING TO SOME SOURCES, IN THE PAST FEW DAYS MORE THAN 1,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN EL SALVADOR AFTER THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE FIGHT BETWEEN GOVERNMENT FORCES AND THE GUERRILLAS. MIKHAIL MAYOROV FILED THIS REPORT: THE HORRIFYING REPORTS PUBLISHED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES GIVE AN APPROPRIATE IDEA OF THE TRAGEDY IN EL SALVADOR, WHERE A CIVIL WAR IS RAVAGING THE COUNTRY. ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR, WHERE THE FIGHT IS BEING WAGED, THE PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO BURN DEAD BODIES RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEIR HOUSES. THE VICTIMS ARE NOT ONLY SOLDIERS AND GUERRILLAS, WHO ARE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE CONFLICT, BUT ALSO CIVILIANS, WHOSE HOUSES ARE HIT BY BOMBS AND PROJECTILES. THE CIVILIANS ARE CONSTANTLY THREATENED BY THE BULLIES OF THE SO-CALLED DEATH SQUADS, WHO MURDERED SIX CATHOLIC PRIESTS AT THE SAN SALVADOR UNIVERSITY CAMPUS. THE SALVADORAN SITUATION, WHICH HAS CAUSED SERIOUS CONCERN, CANNOT BE REGARDED AS SOMETHING WHICH IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS . THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF THE WORLD NOW SEEMS TO BE STRONGER THAN EVER. WE HAVE FINALLY UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE OLD SAYING THAT THERE IS NO ISOLATED TRAGEDY. WE FEEL INCREASINGLY RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE SO-CALLED HOT SPOTS OF THE PLANET. OBVIOUSLY, THE FIRST THING TO BE DONE TO NORMALIZE THE SITUATION IS TO STEM THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT FLOW OF MILITARY SUPPLIES TO BOTH SIDES. MOSCOW HAS ALREADY TAKEN THIS POSITION. HOWEVER, U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH HAS TERMED INADMISSIBLE THE POSSIBILITY OF HALTING THE AID TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI. IF WE COMPARE THE SALVADORAN AND THE AFGHAN SITUATIONS, WHY DOES THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION SO BITTERLY REPPROACHED US FOR HELPING THE NAJIBULLAH REGIME? WE HAVE UNFORTUNATELY NOT YET ADOPTED GENERAL CRITERIA. OUR FOREIGN POLICY IS CONSISTENT, MAYOROV SAYS. IN MY OPINION, SOVIET DIPLOMACY HAS A MORE FLEXIBLE ATTITUDE TOWARD THE CURRENT SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR. THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT HAS ABANDONED ITS CONSERVATIVE STAND, WHICH MADE US SUPPORT JUST ONE SIDE. IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, THE WAR IS A TRAGEDY FOR ALL THE PEOPLE, AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THE TRAGEDY GROWS AS THE CONFLICT BECOMES MORE SERIOUS. THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT WILL REFLECT THE WILLINGNESS THAT MOSCOW AND WASHINGTON HAVE TO HELP A SMALL NATION, WHICH IS TIRED OF A LONG-STANDING CONFLICT, FIND A WAY TOWARDS PEACE. ALL OF US ARE WAITING FOR THE SOVIET-U.S. SUMMIT WHICH WILL BE HELD OFF THE COAST OF MALTA. IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THE ISSUES THAT WILL BE ON THE AGENDA BECAUSE THE MEETING WILL BE UNOFFICIAL . THERE ARE MANY ISSUES THAT MAY BE ADDRESSED IN A BILATERAL SUMMIT. IT IS HIGHLY DESIRABLE, HOWEVER, THAT BOTH SIDES REACH AN UNDERSTANDING AND THAT THEY IDENTIFY THE POSSIBILITIES OF COOPERATION FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PROBLEM.
DEV-MUC3-0889	CLANDESTINE, 28 NOV 89 -- ...LESSENING THE TENSION OVERWHELMING YOUR GOVERNMENT BY REFUSING TO AGREE TO THE CEASE-FIRE WITH INTERNATIONAL SUPERVISION TO START NEGOTIATIONS, PROPOSED BY THE FMLN, WHICH EXPRESSES THE DESIRE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. 3. SEEKING TO AVOID ITS RESPONSIBILITY BY NOT FULFILLING THE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENTS WHICH INCLUDE A COMMITMENT TO HAVE DEMOCRATIZATION, A CEASE-FIRE, AND NATIONAL RECONCILIATION. THIS, ALONG WITH THE BREAK IN RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA IS A HARSH BLOW TO THE REGIONAL PEACE AGREEMENTS. WE RATIFY OUR TOTAL WILLINGNESS TO HAVE A CEASE-FIRE WITH INTERNATIONAL SUPERVISION, AND TO ATTAIN A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION -- THROUGH A CONCERTED NATIONAL EFFORT -- TO HAVE A FIRM AND LONG-LASTING PEACE IN EL SALVADOR. FMLN GENERAL COMMAND: COMMANDERS SALVADOR SANCHEZ CEREN, JORGE SHAFICK HANDAL, EDUARDO SANCHO, FRANCISCO JOVEL, AND JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS.
DEV-MUC3-0890	MANAGUA , 28 NOV 89 -- HEAVY CLASHES ARE STILL TAKING PLACE IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR FOLLOWING A NIGHT OF FIERCE COMBAT, WHICH CONFIRMS PREDICTIONS ON THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE WAR THIS WEEK. PRESS REPORTS RELEASED FROM SAN SALVADOR AT NOON TODAY REPORT THE CONTINUATION OF CLASHES BETWEEN THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT AND THE ARMED FORCES, BASICALLY IN NEIGHBORHOODS IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR. AYUTUXTEPEQUE, SOYAPANGO, ZACAMIL, AND SAN RAMON, ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADO, SEEM TO HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED AGAIN BY GUERRILLA COLUMNS, WHICH CONTROLLED THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS DURING THE FIRST DAYS OF THE NATIONAL OFFENSIVE WHICH BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER. IN ITS MOST RECENT NEWSCAST, THE FMLN'S RADIO VENCEREMOS REPORTED THE AIR FORCE HEAVILY BOMBED AYUTUXTEPEQUE, A DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOOD, AND CONFIRMED THE CLASHES TAKING PLACE IN SOYAPANGO. THE SOURCE REPORTED THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES ELITE TROOPS, AND EVEN INFANTRY BRIGADES FROM MILITARY DETACHMENTS TRADITIONALY STATIONED IN THE COUNTRYSIDE, HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED TO SAN SALVADOR IN AN ATTEMPT TO REPEL THE REBELS' ACTIONS. ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLA REPORTS, DESPITE THE CONTINUOUS BOMBINGS, CLASHES ARE TAKING PLACE AT THIS TIME IN THE CAPITAL OF SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT, IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. SEVERAL SECTORS OF THE PANAMERICAN HIGHWAY, ESPECIALLY IN EASTERN SAN SALVADOR, REMAIN UNDER THE FMLN CONTROL, RADIO VENCEREMOS REPORTED. THE CENTRAL AMERICAN MEDIA TODAY WARNED ABOUT THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE INCIDENTS IN SAN SALVADOR THIS MORNING, WHEN GROUPS OF UNIDENTIFIED MEN MACHINEGUNNED FORMER SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT FRANCISCO GUERRERO, A WELL- KNOWN LEADER OF THE RIGHTWING NATIONAL CONCILIATION PARTY. SOURCES CONSULTED IN SAN SALVADOR, WHICH PREFER NOT TO BE IDENTIFIED, SAID IT IS A FACT THE FAR RIGHTWING IS LINKED TO THIS CRIME. THE SAME SOURCES MAINTAINED THAT THE RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE SUSPENSION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH MANAGUA, MADE BY PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, CAUSED DISAGREEMENTS AMONG THE GOVERNMENT BRANCHES AND AMONG THE VARIOUS PARTIES.
DEV-MUC3-0891	CLANDESTINE, 28 NOV 89 -- WE HAVE RECEIVED A REPORT ADVISING US THAT AT 0200 TODAY, FMLN FORCES ATTACKED A GROUP OF PARATROOPERS AT THE INSA FACTORY IN SOYAPANGO. THE REPORT ALSO ADDS THAT SINCE EARLY THIS MORNING, FIGHTING HAS BEEN GOING ON IN GUADALUPE NEIGHBORHOOD, ALSO IN SOYAPANGO. REPORTS FROM OTHER AREAS OF SAN SALVADOR SPEAK OF HEAVY CLASHES SINCE EARLY THIS MORNING. THE REPORT STATES THAT AT 0200 TODAY, FMLN UNITS ATTACKED TWO 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE COBRA BATTALION COMPANIES IN SAN SALVADOR. THE TROOPS WERE IN EL CARMEN HILL, AYUTUXTEPEQUE JURISDICTION. THE REPORT ADDS THAT THE FMLN INFLICTED TWO DEAD AND THREE WOUNDED, INCLUDING A SERGEANT AND A CORPORAL. THIS MEANS THAT THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE IS ALREADY IN SAN SALVADOR. THIS IS THE WAY THINGS ARE IN SAN SALVADOR: SONSONATE TROOPS, 5TH INFANTRY BRIGADE TROOPS, AND 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE TROOPS ARE IN SAN SALVADOR. THIS IS PROOF OF HOW BAD THE ENEMY IS DOING. THE REPORT ADDS THAT SINCE THIS MORNING, FIGHTING AGAINST ATLACATL BATTALION TROOPS WAS REPORTED IN THE AREA AROUND EL CARMEN HILL. THE ATLACATL BATTALION TROOPS WERE GOING TO REINFORCE THE COWARDLY 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE TROOPS, WHO HAVE LEFT CHALATENANGO AND ARE NOW IN SAN SALVADOR. THE FIGHTING ENDED AT 0930 . WE REPEAT: AT 0200 TODAY, FMLN UNITS ATTACKED A GROUP OF PARATROOPERS AT THE INSA FACTORY IN SOYAPANGO. FIGHTING WAS ALSO REPORTED IN SAN JACINTO, MEJICANOS, AYUTUXTEPEQUE, SOYAPANGO, SANTA EDUVIGES, ESCANDIA NEIGHBORHOOD, EL CARMEN NEIGHBORHOOD, AND OTHER AREAS OF SAN SALVADOR. WE ARE WAITING FOR MORE REPORTS BECAUSE WE HAVE LEARNED THAT FIGHTING HAS RESUMED IN THE CAPITAL CITY. TO ADD TO THE REPORT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM SAN SALVADOR, WE WISH TO STATE THAT HEAVY FIGHTING OCCURRED THIS MORNING IN GUADALUPE NEIGHBORHOOD, SOYAPANGO. AT 0600 , NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS WERE AMBUSHED AT KM 11 ON THE NORTHERN TRUNK ROAD. THE NATIONAL GUARD SUFFERED DEAD AND WOUNDED DURING THAT AMBUSH. WE WILL HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON THIS AMBUSH LATER.
DEV-MUC3-0892	SAN SALVADOR, 28 NOV 89 -- THIS AGAIN PROVES THE AGGRESSION BY THE FMLN AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AGAINST POOR PEOPLE, AND AGAINST OUR COUNTRY'S DISTINGUISHED POLITICIANS. THIS IS ADDED TO THE INNOCENT LIVES TAKEN BY THE FMLN FROM THE SALVADORAN POPULATION. I WANT TO TELL YOU WE HAVE A PERSON UNDER ARREST WHO WAS WOUNDED RIGHT WHERE THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE, BY DR. GUERRERO'S BODYGUARD. WE HAVE HIS IDENTITY, HE IS AFFILITATED TO THE FMLN, BUT WE WILL NOT RELEASE HIS NAME WHILE THE INVESTIGATION IS UNDER WAY. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE THE BEST WITNESS TO THE FMLN AGGRESSION AGAINST OUR PEOPLE. PONCE ALSO SAID THAT THE TERRORISTS CARRY OUT THESE ACTIONS AS PART OF THEIR STRATEGY TO SCARE THE POPULATION. WE WANT TO SAY THAT CONDITIONS TO ENABLE MARXISM AND THE FMLN TO WIN ARE PRACTICALLY NIL. THE PEOPLE COMPLETELY REJECT THEM. THE FMLN ARE USING THAT LYING AND LOSING VENCEREMOS RADIO STATION TO FOOL THEIR OWN CADRES. IN NICARAGUA, THERE WERE SOME STATIONS THAT WERE IN NETWORK WITH THIS LYING AND LOSING VENCEREMOS RADIO STATION, BROADCASTING FALSE REPORTS ABOUT EL SALVADOR. THIS IS ALSO PART OF THE AGGRESSION. TO ALLOW THEIR SO-CALLED HIGH-RANKING FMLN COMMANDERS TO BE IN NICARAGUA IS ALSO PART OF THE AGGRESSION. NO ONE CAN IGNORE THE AGGRESSION THAT THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN EXERTING FOR A LONG TIME AGAINST THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE. HAVING FOUND THESE SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS, DOES IT MEAN YOU MAY EXPECT THE AGGRESSIVE COUNTEROFFENSIVE THESE GROUPS ARE LAUNCHING MAY WIDEN? DEFINITELY NOT. WE BELIEVE THEIR CADRES ARE DECIMATED. THIS COULD AFFECT MAINLY OUR AIR FORCE; HOWEVER, WE ARE TAKING THE PROPER TACTICAL AND TECHNICAL PREVENTIVE MEASURES. WHAT SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR TO ALL SALVADORANS IS THAT FOR THE FMLN TO ATTAIN POWER, WHICH IS THEIR GOAL, THEY WILL HAVE TO CLIMB OVER THE BODY OF THE LAST ARMED FORCES SOLDIER. PONCE ALSO SAID THAT THE MISSILES AND OTHER WEAPONS SENT BY ORTEGA FOR THE FMLN ARE AGRESSIONS AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, EXPLAINING THAT IT WAS A NICARAGUAN WHO LIVES IN THIS CAPITAL WHO IDENTIFIED THE MAN WHO PILOTED THE SMALL AIRCRAFT CARRYING THE WEAPONS FOR THE TERRORISTS. HE SAID THAT IT WAS QUIROS GARCIA. HOWEVER, THAT EVENING HE CALLED BACK AND SAID THAT THE PILOT SHOULD HAVE PART OF HIS THUMB MISSING, AND TO PLEASE CHECK HIM OUT. THE BODY WE HAVE WAS CHECKED AND ONE OF THE THUMBS HAS A PART MISSING. TO US THIS IS IRREFUTABLE PROOF. WE ALL KNOW OF ORTEGA'S CYNCISM. ON THE ONE HAND, HE MADE PROMISES AT ESQUIPULAS II, SIGNING AGREEMENTS HE WAS NOT PREPARED TO IMPLEMENT; HE WOULD NOT DO IT SINCE HE WAS REALLY DOING THESE OTHER THINGS. HE IS THE SAME AS THE FMLN. THE FMLN WAS DISCUSSING PEACE AT A DIALOGUE TABLE WHILE IT WAS PREPARING FOR THIS OFFENSIVE. IT IS A MOCKERY OF THE PEOPLE, BECAUSE THEIR DESIRE FOR PEACE HAS BEEN FOOLED WITH. DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION HAVE BEEN FOOLED. FINALLY, PONCE SAID THE SUBVERSIVE GROUPS HAVE LOW MORALE AND ARE DESPERATE, BECAUSE IF DANIEL ORTEGA LOSES THE ELECTIONS, THEY, TOO, WILL LOSE, AND FOREVER. ADDITIONALLY, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE DO NOT SUPPORT THEIR IRRATIONAL ACTIONS THAT ONLY PRODUCE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION.
DEV-MUC3-0893	SAN SALVADOR, 28 NOV 89 -- THERE IS PROFOUND INDIGNATION OVER THE MURDER OF DR. FRANCISCO JOSE GUERRERO, PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE. THE MURDER WAS COMMITTED BY TERRORISTS AT ABOUT 0930 THIS MORNING. ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, THE TERRORISTS DROVE A YELLOW VOLKSWAGEN. PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ORDERED A COMPLETE INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE WHO MURDERED DR GUERRERO AND TO BRING THEM TO TRIAL ACCORDING TO THE SALVADORAN PENAL CODE, WHICH WAS MODIFIED A FEW DAYS AGO. BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS HAVE SPOKEN OUT AGAINST THESE CRIMES, BECAUSE THEY ONLY BRING MORE GRIEF AND PAIN TO THE SUFFERING SALVADORAN PEOPLE.
DEV-MUC3-0894	SAN SALVADOR, 28 NOV 89 -- AT LEAST 9 PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND 13 MORE WERE WOUNDED -- INCLUDING SOLDIERS, REBELS, AND CIVILIANS -- IN THE ARMED CONFRONTATIONS DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS IN SAN SALVADOR AND 2 DEPARTMENTS IN THE NORTH AND EAST OF EL SALVADOR, ACCORDING TO MILITARY REPORTS. FOUR GUERRILLAS DIED AND TWO SOLDIERS WERE WOUNDED IN CONFRONTATIONS THAT OCCURRED EARLY THIS MORNING IN THE CITIES OF MEJICANOS AND CIUDAD DELGADO, LOCATED NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR, ACCORDING TO THE SAME REPORTS. THE CONFRONTATIONS, IN WHICH CARBINES, MORTARS, AND EXPLOSIVES WERE USED, BEGAN AT 0230 , WHEN THE REBELS "TRIED TO ENTER" THE NORTHERN SUBURBS OF SAN SALVADOR, BUT THEY WERE "REPELLED" BY GOVERNMENT TROOPS WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE AIR FORCE, ACCORDING TO THE ARMY'S PRESS OFFICE. ANOTHER FOUR GUERRILLAS WERE KILLED AND TWO WERE WOUNDED IN ARMED CONFRONTATIONS IN TONACATEPEQUE, 16 KM NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR, AND IN CHALATENANGO AND SAN MIGUEL, LOCATED IN THE NORTHERN AND EASTERN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, RESPECTIVELY. THE ARMY HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ONE SOLDIER DIED AND ANOTHER FIVE WERE WOUNDED IN THOSE PLACES. THE ARMED FORCES HAVE STATED THAT FOUR EMPLOYEES OF THE RIO LEMPA HYDROELECTRIC EXECUTIVE COMMISSION WERE WOUNDED BY EXPLOSIVES THAT HAD BEEN PLACED BY THE REBELS IN A TECHNICAL INSTITUTE LOCATED IN THE ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH HAD BEEN OCCUPIED FOR SOME DAYS BY THE REBELS DURING THE RECENT OFFENSIVE. THE ARMY ALSO INDICATES THAT THE REBELS SET FIRE TO A CAR AND ANOTHER TWO VEHICLES IN SAN SALVADOR AND SAN MIGUEL.
DEV-MUC3-0895	SAN SALVADOR, 28 NOV 89 -- IN LIGHT OF THE TERRORIST ARMED AGGRESSION LAUNCHED AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE BY THE FMLN WITH THE OPEN SUPPORT AND DIRECTION OF THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT HEADED BY DANIEL ORTEGA ON 11 NOVEMBER, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT ADVISES THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT ON THE DAY THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT ASSUMED OFFICE, IT EXPRESSED ITS FIRM DESIRE TO SEEK, THROUGH THE CIVILIZED PATH OF DIALOGUE, A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT BECAUSE THE MARXIST - LENINIST GROUP'S CAUSE BRINGS BLOODSHED TO OUR PEOPLE. IN THIS SENSE, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT PROMOTED THE PROCESS OF DIALOGUE THAT BEGAN IN MEXICO CITY ON 13, 14, AND 15 SEPTEMBER 1989. AT THAT TIME, GOVERNMENT AND FMLN DELEGATIONS SIGNED AN AGREEMENT COMMITTING THEMSELVES TO SEEK AN END TO HOSTILITIES WITHIN THE SPIRIT OF THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS IN TELA, HONDURAS. BASED ON THE AGREEMENT REACHED IN MEXICO CITY, THE ISSUE TO BE BROACHED DURING THE SECOND ROUND OF TALKS TO BE HELD IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, ON 16 AND 17 OCTOBER WOULD BE THE END TO HOSTILITIES BASED ON PROPOSALS PRESENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN. AT THAT TIME, THE FMLN DID NOT ALLOW THE DISCUSSION OF THE TOPIC PREVIOUSLY AGREED ON AND PRESENTED A SERIES OF PROPOSALS, DELIBERATELY COMPLEX IN FORM AND CONTENT, WITH THE EVIDENT PURPOSE OF PREVENTING THE MAIN AND ONLY TOPIC ON THE AGENDA FROM BEING DISCUSSED. ON 11 NOVEMBER, THE FMLN LAUNCHED AN AGGRESSION AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AN AGGRESSION THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY PLANNED AT LEAST A FEW MONTHS BEFORE IT WAS LAUNCHED. THIS PROVES THAT WHILE THE FMLN WAS TALKING PEACE AND NEGOTIATIONS AROUND THE NEGOTIATING TABLE, IT WAS, WITH THE POLITICAL, LOGISTICAL, AND MILITARY SUPPORT OF ORTEGA'S GOVERNMENT, PREPARING THE CRIMINAL ATTACK AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE TERRORIST AGGRESSION TO DATE, CERTAIN THINGS HAVE HAPPENED THAT PROVE THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE GENOCIDE IMPLEMENTED BY THE FMLN TERRORISTS. THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS PROOF THAT THE FMLN IS A PUPPET OF DANIEL ORTEGA'S DEADLY PLANS WHO, FACED WITH AN IMMINENT ELECTORAL DEFEAT AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH FIDEL CASTRO, IS ATTEMPTING TO REGIONALIZE IN CENTRAL AMERICA AN ARMED CONFLICT TO TRY TO SAVE THE SANDINIST REGIME. IN LIGHT OF THE AFOREMENTIONED AND HAVING ESTABLISHED THE PARTICIPATION OF THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT IN THE TERRORIST AGGRESSION EXPERIENCED BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AGREED, ON 26 NOVEMBER 1989, TO SUSPEND DIPLOMATIC AND COMMERCIAL RELATIONS WITH THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT AND RECALLED ITS DIPLOMATIC MISSION FOR CONSULTATIONS. IN LIGHT OF THESE SERIOUS ACTIONS WHICH VIOLATE INTERNATIONAL LAW, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS PRESENTED FORMAL CHARGES BEFORE THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE OAS SO THAT IMMEDIATE AND EFFICIENT MEASURES WILL BE TAKEN TO REPUDIATE THESE TERRORIST ACTIONS AND SO THAT THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WILL BE DIPLOMATICALLY AND POLITICALLY PRESSURED TO STOP THE AGGRESSION IT HAS UNLEASHED AGAINST EL SALVADOR, AND THUS STOP A POSSIBLE CONFLICT OF UNPREDICTABLE DIMENSIONS. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT AT A TIME LIKE THIS, WHEN AROUND THE WORLD MOMENTS OF POLITICAL FREEDOM ARE BEING EXPERIENCED IN PLACES LIKE POLAND, THE GDR, CZECHOSLOVAKIA, AND HUNGARY, HERE, IN EL SALVADOR, BECAUSE OF THE FMLN'S IRRATIONAL ACTIONS -- WITH ORTEGA'S SUPPORT -- ATTEMPTS ARE BEING MADE TO DROWN A NATION WHICH, DESPITE 10 YEARS OF WAR, IS TRYING TO CONSOLIDATE A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS? THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE ARE UNITED DURING THIS HISTORIC TEST TO ACHIEVE PEACE WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM.
DEV-MUC3-0896	SAN SALVADOR, 28 NOV 89 -- DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTER COLONEL JUAN ORLANDO ZEPEDA HAS SAID THAT THE ARMED FORCES STRUCTURE REMAINS INTACT AND THAT THE FMLN TERRORISTS HAVE NO POSSIBILITY OF LAUNCHING ANOTHER OFFENSIVE. COL ZEPEDA SAID THAT THE COMMUNIST'S INDISCRIMINATE ATTACK WAS LAUNCHED AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AND NOT AGAINST THE MILITARY. ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY CHIEF, THE TERRORISTS WERE TRYING TO ENCOURAGE AN UPRISING AMONG THE PEOPLE; HOWEVER, THEY FAILED IN THEIR ATTEMPT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE TURNED THEIR BACKS ON THEM AND GAVE THEIR SUPPORT TO THE ARMED FORCES. COL ZEPEDA SAID THAT THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE FOR THE ARMED FORCES HAS BEEN ESSENTIAL AND VERY IMPORTANT TO NEUTRALIZE THE FMLN'S COMMUNIST ATTACK. THE DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTER SAID THAT THANKS TO THIS TOTAL SUPPORT, THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LOCATE A LOT OF WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION. COL ZEPEDA MENTIONED THE ALTOS DE LA CUEVA CASE IN SAN MIGUEL, WHERE APPROXIMATELY A MILLION ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION WERE FOUND. ZEPEDA CALLED ON THE PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR TRUST IN THE ARMED FORCES, ADDING THAT THE ARMED FORCES' MORALE IS HIGH, VERY HIGH.
DEV-MUC3-0897	CLANDESTINE, 29 NOV 89 -- ATTENTION, ATTENTION. WE HAVE LAST MINUTE INFORMATION. ATTENTION. FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT FORCES HAVE BROKEN THE SIEGE THAT THE FASCIST TROOPS WERE MAINTAINING AROUND NORTHWESTERN AND NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR. ATTENTION. WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING IN AREAS CLOSE TO THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF HEADQUARTERS. WE REPEAT. WE ARE FIGHTING IN AREAS CLOSE TO THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF HEADQUARTERS. WE ARE FIGHTING IN LA SULTANA NEIGHBORHOOD, ON THE SOUTHERN HIGHWAY AND AROUND THE DEMOCRACIA BUILDING. OUR UNITS ENTERED THE MANUEL JOSE ARCE NEIGHBORHOOD INHABITED BY HIGH-RANKING MILITARY CHIEFS AND OCCUPIED SEVERAL HOUSES THERE. OUR FORCES FOUND ARSENALS IN SOME OF THE HOUSES AND CLASHED AGAINST ENEMY TROOPS. OUR FORCES SEIZED MANY WEAPONS INCLUDING RIFLES, MACHINEGUNS, AMMUNITION, AND OTHER WAR MATERIAL. ALL THOSE WEAPONS WERE FOUND IN THE HOUSES OF SEVERAL HIGH-RANKING MILITARY CHIEFS IN THE MANUEL JOSE ARCE NEIGHBORHOOD. WE ALSO HAVE REPORTS ON CLASHES IN THE AREA OF ANTIGUO CUSCATLAN WHERE MILITARY DETACHMENT NO 6 REINFORCEMENTS REFUSED TO ADVANCE. THE SONSONATE TROOPS REFUSED TO ADVANCE TOWARD OUR POSITIONS IN THE AREA OF ANTIGUO CUSCATLAN. SIMILARLY, OUR FORCES ARE HOLDING POSITIONS IN SOYAPANGO, MEJICANOS, CUSCATANCINGO, AND AYUTUXTEPEQUE. OUR FORCES ALSO HAVE CONTROL OF THE NORTHERN TRUNK HIGHWAY AND OTHER IMPORTANT ROUTES LEADING TO SAN SALVADOR. THERE ARE CLASHES AGAINST BRACAMONTE BATTALION TROOPS IN LA SULTANA NEIGHBORHOOD, SAN FRANCISCO, AND ANTIGUO CUSCATLAN. THE ENEMY HAS REACTED IN FOUR DIFFERENT WAYS. THE ENEMY SENT BRACAMONTE BATTALION REINFORCEMENTS IN ONE DIRECTION, BUT THEIR ADVANCE WAS NEUTRALIZED AND HALTED AT THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD. WE REPEAT. THE FIRST HIGH COMMAND RESPONSE TO OUR INCURSION INTO NORTHWESTERN AND WESTERN SAN SALVADOR RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS INCLUDING BRACAMONTE BATTALION REINFORCEMENTS HAS BEEN NEUTRALIZED. OUR FORCES AMBUSHED AND NEUTRALIZED THOSE BRACAMONTE BATTALION REINFORCEMENTS. A SECOND ENEMY RESPONSE TO OUR INCURSION INTO AND CONTROL OF NORTHWESTERN AND WESTERN SAN SALVADOR MOVED ALONG THE SOUTHERN HIGHWAY AND WAS AMBUSHED WITH RPG-7 ROCKET LAUNCHERS AND THEREFORE NEUTRALIZED. THE ENEMY'S THIRD RESPONSE MOVING THROUGH SANTA TECLA WAS ALSO ATTACKED BY OUR FORCES AND HAS BEEN NEUTRALIZED WITH AN AMBUSH NEAR LA UNIVERSAL AND GUADALUPE GARDENS. THESE ATLACATL BATTALION FORCES WERE ALSO NEUTRALIZED. WE ARE RECEIVING THIS REPORT FROM SAN SALVADOR. THE HIGH COMMAND'S FIRST AND BELATED RESPONSE INCLUDED FOUR MOVEMENTS, WHICH WERE ALL HALTED BY OUR FORCES. THOSE FOUR HIGH COMMAND DEFENSIVE MOVEMENTS HAVE BEEN ATTACKED AND NEUTRALIZED. BOTH THE BRACAMONTE AND THE ATLACATL BATTALIONS HAVE BEEN NEUTRALIZED. MEANWHILE THE TROOPS COMING FROM SONSONATE REFUSED TO ADVANCE IN SOUTHWESTERN SAN SALVADOR. CLASHES NOW COVER A LARGE AREA FROM THE HIGHWAY LINKING SANTA TECLA AND SAN SALVADOR AND THROUGH LA MASCOTA, LAS PALMAS, SAN BENITO, MAQUILIGUE, CAMPESTRE, LOMAS VERDES, ESCALON NEIGHBORHOODS, CONTINUING TO THE SAN SALVADOR VOLCANO AND MOVING THROUGH THE ENTIRE NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR INCLUDING AYUTUXTEPEQUE, CUSCATANCINGO, NORTHERN MEJICANOS, AND MEJICANOS ITSELF AND THEN MOVING TO CIUDAD DELGADO, SOYAPANGO, AND THE SOUTHERN SECTION OF THE PAN-AMERICAN HIGHWAY, WHERE OUR UNITS MAINTAIN POSITIONS AND ARE ADVANCING TOWARD ENEMY FORCES. IN OTHER WORDS, AT THIS HOUR THE FMLN HAS FORMED THE LARGEST ARCH OF ATTACKS DURING OUR FORCES' ENTIRE OCCUPATION OF SAN SALVADOR.
DEV-MUC3-0898	CLANDESTINE, 29 NOV 89 -- WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE GENERAL STAFF HAS ERECTED A HUMAN WALL, ERECTED BY COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, FOLLOWING THE ARTILLERY ATTACK STAGED BY US AT 0515 THIS MORNING ON THE GENERAL STAFF INSTALLATIONS. IT WAS REPORTED THAT HUNDREDS OF LITTLE SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN PLACED AS CANNON FODDER OUTSIDE THE GENERAL STAFF INSTALLATIONS. THIS GIVES US NEW INTELLIGENCE DATA ON THE MORALE OF COL PONCE, HOW THE CRISIS IS AFFECTING HIM. WITHOUT ANY MILITARY CRITERION, HE HAS PLACED A WALL OF SOLDIERS AROUND THE GENERAL STAFF INSTALATIONS. THIS IS A GOOD PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE GIVEN TO US BY COL PONCE, CONCERNING HIS PHYSICAL STATE AND CONCERNING THE UPSET BEING SUFFERED BY THE STRATEGIC ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF COMMAND. WE CALL ON THE INHABITANTS OF THE COUNTRY CLUB, THE MAQUILIGUAS, SAN BENITO, AND ESCALON NEIGHBORHOODS TO IMMEDIATELY ABANDON THAT COMBAT ZONE. THE FIGHTING WILL GET WORSE AND THE AIR FORCE WILL BOMB THE FMLN POSITIONS IN SAN BENITO AND ESCALON NEIGHBORHOODS, THEREFORE ITS INHABITANTS ARE URGED TO ABANDON THAT RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT IN SAN SALVADOR. A REPORT FROM USULUTAN INDICATES AT THIS TIME THAT THE FMLN UNITS ARE ADVANCING AND FIGHTING IN THE SECTOR OF GAVIRIA, EL MANGUITO, AND LOS PILOTOS NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE CITY OF USULUTAN. ALSO, IN THE AREA OF SANTA ELENA THERE IS FIERCE FIGHTING. YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE. WE HAVE ANOTHER REPORT FROM SAN SALVADOR. IMPORTANT INFORMATION IS BEING RECEIVED FROM LOMAS VERDES. IN THE STRATEGIC ZONE OF LOMAS VERDES IN THE NORTHWESTERN PART OF THE CAPITAL, AN ARMY ARMORED VEHICLE WAS DESTROYED AND ITS 50-CALIBER MACHINEGUN WAS SEIZED, AS WELL AS MANY RIFLES AND MACHINEGUNS FROM THE NATIONAL POLICE AND CAVALRY TROOPS. YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS REPORT FROM SAN SALVADOR. FIGHTING IN THE EXCLUSIVE LOMAS VERDES NEIGHBORHOOD INDICATES THAT AN ARMORED VEHICLE WAS DESTROYED. DURING THE FIGHTING A 50-CALIBER MACHINEGUN WAS SEIZED FROM THE DAMAGED ARMORED VEHICLE. IT IS BEING EMPLACED AND WILL BE USED AGAINST THE AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS AND AIRCRAFT THAT ARE OVERFLYING THE AREA. SINCE 0000, WHEN THE FIGHTING BEGAN, TO 0940, WHEN WE RECEIVED THE REPORT OF THE FIGHTING IN LOMAS VERDES NEIGHBORHOOD IN THE WESTERN PART OF THE CAPITAL, NEAR ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD, OUR FORCES HAVE DESTROYED AN ARMORED VEHICLE AND SEIZED IN COMBAT TWO M-60 MACHINEGUNS, 8 M-16 RIFLES, 1 M-79 GRENADE LAUNCHER, THREE VRC COMMUNICATION RADIOS, AND A 50-CALIBER MACHINEGUN SEIZED FROM THE ARMORED VEHICLE. THIS OCCURRED DURING THE FIGHTING WITH THE NATIONAL POLICE AND CAVALRY TROOPS, WHICH SUSTAINED 14 CASUALTIES.
DEV-MUC3-0899	CLANDESTINE, 29 NOV 89 -- WE HAVE AN ACAN-EFE REPORT ON THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR. THE REPORT READS: THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS TODAY UNLEASHED A NEW OFFENSIVE IN SAN SALVADOR WITH ATTACKS ON MILITARY INSTALLATIONS AND FIERCE CLASHES WITH THE ARMY IN SEVERAL NEIGHBORHOODS IN SAN SALVADOR, WHICH CONTINUE UP UNTIL MID-MORNING ON 29 NOVEMBER. THE ACAN-EFE REPORT ADDS: THE GUERRILLAS' ACTIONS AFFECTED ESCALON, SAN FRANCISCO, AND SAN BENITO NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THE RESIDENCES OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND U.S. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER ARE LOCATED. A LOCAL TELEVISION STATION REPORTED THERE WERE SHOOTOUTS EARLY THIS MORNING ON LA CAPILLA STREET IN SAN BENITO NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THE RESIDENCE OF U.S. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER IS LOCATED. THE FMLN AND THE ARMY ARE ALSO FIGHTING IN MEJICANOS AND CIUDAD DELGADO IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR. THE FMLN IS MAINTAINING POSITIONS ON THE HIGHWAY LINKING SAN SALVADOR TO THE WESTERN SECTOR OF THE COUNTRY. THE FMLN REPORTED THIS MORNING THAT ITS TROOPS AMBUSHED PATROLS FROM THE ARMED FORCES ELITE BATTALIONS. WITNESSES CONFIRMED TO ACAN-EFE THAT THE FMLN TOOK POSITIONS IN ANTIGUO CUSCATLAN, A TOWN SOUTHEAST OF SAN SALVADOR. THIS HAS BEEN AN ACAN-EFE REPORT ON THE SITUATION IN SAN SALVADOR.
DEV-MUC3-0900	CLANDESTINE, 29 NOV 89 -- THE FIGHTING IN THE SAN SALVADOR RESIDENTIAL AREAS BRINGS UP SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES IN THE FORM AND CONTENT OF THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR WHEN THE FIGHTING TAKES PLACE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE POOR AND WHEN THE FIGHTING TAKES PLACE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE RICH. TODAY, WHEN THE FIGHTING TOOK PLACE IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CAPITAL CITY, INCLUDING PLACES SUCH AS THE ESCALON, SAN BENITO, SAN FRANCISCO, AND GENERAL ARCE RESIDENTIAL AREAS WHERE U.S. DIPLOMATIC PERSONNEL LIVE, WHERE THE MILITARY OFFICERS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE THEIR RESIDENCES, WHERE THE SALVADORAN HIGH SOCIETY HAS ITS RESIDENCES, THEN THE REPERCUSSIONS ARE VERY DIFFERENT. U.S. GOVERNMENT SPOKESMEN REACTED QUICKLY AND WITHOUT DELAY. MARLIN FITZWATER, JAMES BAKER, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, AMBASSADOR WALKER, EVERYONE WAS VERY WORRIED OVER THE FATE OF U.S. PERSONNEL. THEY EXPRESSED ANGRY WORDS AGAINST THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT . IF THERE IS SOMEONE IN THE WORLD THAT IS WELL INFORMED OF THE WAR SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR, IT IS PRECISELY THE PENTAGON, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, AND THE U.S. EMBASSY, BECAUSE THEY HAVE FINANCED AND GIVEN ADVICE TO THE SALVADORAN ARMY. IT IS NOT OUR PRESENCE IN THE SAN SALVADOR RESIDENTIAL AREAS THAT JEOPARDIZES U.S. PERSONNEL. ON THE CONTRARY, IT IS THE U.S. PRESENCE, THE U.S. MEDDLING IN EL SALVADOR THAT IS JEOPARDIZING ITS STAFF. THEY CANNOT ASK US TO GET OUT OF SAN SALVADOR SO THAT THE AMERICANS WILL NOT BE TRAPPED IN THE CROSSFIRE. IT IS THE U.S. INTERVENTION IN THE COUNTRY THAT MUST COME TO AN END, SO THAT WE SALVADORANS WILL BE ABLE TO SETTLE OUR PROBLEMS AMONG OURSELVES. THIS IS OUR LAND, OUR FATHERLAND. THE WAR WAS IMPOSED BY THE INJUSTICES, THE SLAUGHTERS, THE DICTATORSHIPS, AND TO A GREAT EXTENT, BY THE AMERICANS WHO SPEND $1.4 MILLION DAILY IN THIS WAR. THIS IS A CRUCIAL MOMENT FOR EL SALVADOR. THAT IS WHY WE DEMAND THAT THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION, THAT IS, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, THE U.S. CONGRESS, AND THE U.S. PEOPLE CAREFULLY THINK THIS OVER AND ACT SENSIBLY SO THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO PUT AN END TO THIS WAR. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT -- THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION -- THINK THIS OVER AND PROMOTE CHANGES IN ITS POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR, AND THUS MAKE FEASIBLE A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT. WE HAVE PUBLICLY AND OFFICIALLY SAID, AS ONE OF OUR MANY GESTURES OF GOOD WILL, THAT THE FMLN WILL NOT ATTACK U.S. DIPLOMATIC INSTALLATIONS OR PERSONNEL IN EL SALVADOR. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE INSTRUCTED OUR UNITS, OUR FIGHTERS, AND COMMANDO GROUPS NOT TO ATTACK DIPLOMATIC SITES, BECAUSE NATURALLY THEY ARE NOT MILITARY TARGETS FOR THE FMLN. WE HOPE THAT IN THE SAME MANNER, BOTH THE U.S. EMBASSY AS WELL AS THE OTHER DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATIVES WILL INSTRUCT THEIR SECURITY GUARDS SO THEY WILL NOT BECOME INVOLVED IN THE FIGHTING, THUS PREVENTING CONFUSION THAT WE WOULD ALL REGRET. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CAN PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE IN DEFINING THE CONFLICT. THE U.S. CONGRESS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE OAS, ARE ALREADY DISCUSSING THE TRUE SITUATION OF OUR COUNTRY. WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE MOMENT TO CHANGE POLICIES. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CANNOT CONTINUE TO FINANCE AND SUPPORT A REGIME WHICH IS BOMBING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN THE CITIES, A REGIME WHICH MURDERS PRIESTS, WHICH PUBLICLY THREATENS THE BISHOPS. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MUST USE ITS GOOD JUDGMENT AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE END OF THE WAR, AND NOT CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A FASCIST REGIME THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE IN OUR FATHERLAND, EL SALVADOR.
DEV-MUC3-0901	SAN SALVADOR, 29 NOV 89 -- THE SALVADORAN ARMY GAVE ASSURANCES TONIGHT THAT THE SITUATION "HAS BEEN CONTROLLED" IN THE VICINITY OF THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF, WHERE TODAY ONCE AGAIN THE REBELS AND THE MILITARY CLASHED. NEVERTHELESS, ARMED FORCES SPOKESMAN MAJOR MAURICIO CHAVEZ SAID ON A RADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK THAT IN THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD "THE SITUATION REMAINS DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE TERRORISTS HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL CIVILIANS AS HOSTAGES." THE SOURCE SAID THAT AN UNSPECIFIED NUMBER OF CIVILIANS ARE BEING HELD HOSTAGE BY GUERRILLAS IN ESCALON, AN EXCLUSIVE NEIGHBORHOOD IN THE NORTHEN PART OF SAN SALVADOR, WHERE CLASHES RESUMED AT DAWN ON 29 NOVEMBER. THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT TODAY ALSO ATTACKED THE GENERAL STAFF, A RESIDENCE FOR U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS, AND PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S RESIDENCE. THE REBELS HAVE OCCUPIED SEVERAL MANSIONS FROM WHICH THEY ARE ATTACKING THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS IN AN AREA POPULATED BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, DIPLOMATS, AND WHERE THE UN OFFICE IN EL SALVADOR IS LOCATED. ACCORDING TO THE OFFICER, THE ARMY HAS BESIEGED THE AREA AND "EXPECTS TO CONTROL THE SITUATION WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS." MAJOR CHAVEZ CACERES REASSERTED THE "ARMY'S IRREVOCABLE WILL TO DEFEND THE CIVILIAN POPULATION" IN THAT AREA, WHILE THE SALVADORAN GREEN CROSS REPORTED THAT IT HAS EVACUATED SEVERAL FAMILIES FROM THE SECTOR.
DEV-MUC3-0902	SAN SALVADOR, 29 NOV 89 -- NATIONAL GUARD PERSONNEL STATIONED IN SAN MIGUEL HAVE CAPTURED THE FMLN TERRORIST COMMANDER WHO GOES BY THE PSEUDONYM ARISTIDES IN A NEIGHBORHOOD IN THAT TOWN. ARISTIDES HAD BEEN OPERATING IN A LARGE SECTOR OF THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY FOR SOME TIME, AND HAD COMMITTED ALL TYPES OF CRIMES AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. COMMANDER ARISTIDES HAS PROVIDED THE ARMED FORCES WITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION DIRECTLY LINKING THE CYNICAL NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA'S GOVERNMENT TO THE FMLN.
DEV-MUC3-0903	MOSCOW , 29 NOV 89 -- SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED LAST SUNDAY THAT THE REPUBLIC OF EL SALVADOR HAS BROKEN DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH NICARAGUA. ANALYST ALEKSEY PAVLOV DISCUSSES THIS SUBJECT: FOR THOSE WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH CENTRAL AMERICAN ISSUES, THIS NEWS IS NO SURPRISE. GIVEN THE FAILURE OF THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS AS WELL AS THE RESUMPTION OF THE WAR, THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION WAS PRESSURED BY CERTAIN U.S. CIRCLES TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA. THE MEDIA ARE CONDUCTING A CRUSADE TO CONVINCE THE PUBLIC THAT CUBA, NICARAGUA, AND CERTAINLY THE USSR, ARE PROVIDING WEAPONS TO THE REVOLUTIONARIES. THE UNITED STATES CERTAINLY PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS CAMPAIGN, AND SO HAS PRESIDENT CRISTIANI BY DECLARING THAT HE WILL NOT ATTEND THE REGIONAL PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT SCHEDULED FOR DECEMBER IN MANAGUA. APPARENTLY, CRISTIANI NEEDED TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA IN ORDER NOT TO ATTEND TO THE SUMMIT. THIS IS COMPREHENSIBLE BECAUSE THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS THE COMPLIANCE WITH THE TELA AGREEMENTS, THE DISMANTLING OF THE CONTRAS, AND THE CONTINUATION OF PEACE TALKS IN EL SALVADOR. IN FACT, CRISTIANI WAS UNABLE TO JUSTIFY HIS REFUSAL TO ATTEND THIS SUMMIT. THERE ARE OTHER REASONS WHY CRISTIANI WISHES TO USE THE BREAK WITH NICARAGUA AS A MASK. HE IS TRYING TO DISTRACT PUBLIC ATTENTION FROM THE SALVADORAN ARMY'S HEAVY BOMBINGS OF HEAVILY POPULATED AREAS, INCLUDING THE CAPITAL, AND THE REPRESSION AGAINST SALVADORAN RELIGIOUS AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS. IN OTHER TERMS, CRISTIANI WANTS TO CONCEAL THE FACT THAT HE CANNOT CONTROL THE EXCESSES COMMITTED BY HIS GENERALS; THAT IS, THE GENOCIDE THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMY IS PERPETRATING AGAINST ITS OWN PEOPLE. THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO UNABLE TO CONTROL THE DEATH SQUADS WHICH ARE MURDERING PEOPLE WITH IMPUNITY. IT IS REVEALING THAT SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE CRISTIANI DECLARED THE BREAK OF DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH NICARAGUA, NICARAGUAN EMBASSY STAFF IN SAN SALVADOR WERE EVACUATED HOME IN FACE OF THE DEATH THREATS BY THE DEATH SQUADS. IS THIS MERE COINCIDENCE? OF COURSE NOT. MOST PROBABLY THESE DEATH SQUADS RECEIVED ORDERS TO MAKE SUCH THREATS WITH A VIEW TOWARD THE DIPLOMATIC BREAK. BY WHAT CAN BE SEEN, THE ACTION OF DEATH SQUADS IS COMMON PRACTICE FOR THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER, THIS DIPLOMATIC BREAK IS A SERIOUS ACT FOR WHICH CRISTIANI IS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE. HONDURAN PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA HOYO CONSIDERS THIS ACTION A GREAT DANGER TO PEACE IN THE ISTHMUS. THIS IS AN UNQUESTIONABLE FACT.
DEV-MUC3-0904	CLANDESTINE, 30 NOV 89 -- REGARDING THE INTERNATIONAL SCANDAL THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS MADE OVER AN ALLEGED SHIPMENT OF SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES FOUND INSIDE A WRECKED LIGHT AIRCRAFT, THE FMLN EXPRESSES THE FOLLOWING: 1. IN VIEW OF A POSSIBLE INTENSIFICATION OF THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT, IT IS NECESSARY TO NOTE THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES WERE THE FIRST ONES TO ESCALATE THE WAR BY LAUNCHING INDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS AND AIR BOMBINGS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN DENSELY POPULATED URBAN AREAS. THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAD BEEN DOING THIS FOR SEVERAL YEARS IN OUR COUNTRY'S RURAL AREAS. IN VIEW OF THE DAMAGE THAT THIS CAUSES THE POPULATION, SINCE 1987 THE FMLN HAS MADE PROPOSALS TO SCALE DOWN THE WAR AND SUSPEND THE USE OF AIRCRAFT AND AVIATION EQUIPMENT. THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT'S CHARGES ARE HYPOCRITICAL, AS THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF HAS TURNED AIRCRAFT INTO REAL INSTRUMENTS OF GENOCIDE AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. 2. THE POLICY OF THE PREVIOUS U.S. ADMINISTRATION HAS TURNED CENTRAL AMERICA INTO A HUGE ARMS MARKET WHEREBY THOUSANDS OF TONS OF SOVIET AND U.S. WEAPONS, INCLUDING SURFACE-TO AIR MISSILES, HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED INTO THE AREA. THIS HAS CREATED A FLOURISHING BLACK MARKET FOR WEAPONS, WHERE SALVADORAN AND HONDURAN MILITARY MEN AND NICARAGUAN CONTRAS PARTICIPATE AS BIG-TIME SMUGGLERS. 3. THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN A CAMPAIGN OF ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WITH THE INTENTION OF PUTTING UP A SMOKE SCREEN TO COVER THE GENOCIDE IT HAS UNLEASHED AND TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, WHICH HAS BEEN DEMANDING: A) THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT STOP THE MASSIVE AND INDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS IN DENSELY POPULATED URBAN AREAS AND THE PERSECUTION AGAINST THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION AND GRASS ROOTS MOVEMENTS; B) AN INVESTIGATION TO CLEAR UP THE MURDER OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO DOMESTIC WORKERS, ALONG WITH THE PUNISHMENT OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE AND SIMILAR CRIMES; AND, C) THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT ACCEPT THE CEASE-FIRE IT HAS HERETOFORE REJECTED AND JUSTIFY ITS INTRANSIGENT AND IRRATIONAL POSITION. 4. CRISTIANI'S DECISION TO SUSPEND RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA BASED ON AN ALLEGED SHIPMENT OF MISSILES FOR THE FMLN IS NOT REASONABLE, NOT EVEN BY SAYING THAT THIS REPRESENTS AN ESCALATION OF THE SALVADORAN WAR. IN FACT, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS ESCALATED THE WAR BY SENDING $4 BILLION IN AID TO STRENGTHEN THE ARMY AND PROVIDE IT WITH A POWERFUL AIR FORCE. THE JUSTIFICATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN NICARAGUA'S SUPPORT TO THE FMLN, THUS REFUSING TO ADMIT THE INTERNAL CAUSES OF THE CONFLICT AND ALSO KEEPING THE DOORS CLOSED TO ANY NEGOTIATIONS. THIS HAS UNNECESSARILY PROLONGED THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S SUFFERING AND HAS MADE MORE DRAMATIC THEIR LEGITIMATE STRUGGLE FOR A TRUE DEMOCRATIC, PLURALIST, AND NON-ALIGNED GOVERNMENT. BASED ON THE ABOVE, WE REITERATE: 1. THAT WE CONSIDER ABSOLUTELY LEGITIMATE OUR RIGHT TO OBTAIN ALL TYPES OF WEAPONS TO GUARANTEE OUR DEFENSE AND TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE FROM THE MILITARY ESCALATION PROMOTED BY THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WITH THE FIRM SUPPORT OF THE PREVIOUS AND PRESENT U.S. GOVERNMENTS. THIS INCLUDES THE RIGHT TO OBTAIN WEAPONS FROM VARIOUS SOURCES AND TO GUARANTEE THEIR ARRIVAL AT OUR WAR FRONTS THROUGH ANY MEANS AVAILABLE. 2. WE MAINTAIN OUR TOTAL WILLINGNESS TO DE-ESCALATE THE WAR. WE BEGIN BY EXPRESSING THAT WE ARE TOTALLY WILLING TO AGREE ON A CEASE-FIRE WITH INTERNATIONAL SUPERVISION AND TO BEGIN REAL NEGOTIATIONS TO END THE WAR WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL THE NATION'S POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES. 3. WE ARE WILLING TO REFRAIN FROM USING THE SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES IF THE AIR FORCE CALLS A COMPLETE HALT TO ITS BOMBINGS, STRAFING, AND MACHINEGUNNING THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL TERRITORY. FMLN GENERAL COMMAND COMMANDERS JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, SHAFIK JORGE HANDAL, EDUARDO SANCHO, SALVADOR SANCHEZ SEREN, AND FRANCISCO JOVEL EL SALVADOR, 29 NOVEMBER 1989
DEV-MUC3-0905	SAN SALVADOR, 30 NOV 89 -- THERE IS A TENSE CALM, INTERRUPTED BY SPORADIC SHOOTING, IN THE EXCLUSIVE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL TODAY. AT THE SAME TIME, MANY FOREIGNERS ARE LEAVING THE NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH WAS THE SITE OF HEAVY FIGHTING BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES AND GUERRILLAS YESTERDAY. AN OFFICIAL OF THE UN OFFICE, WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE AREA OF FIGHTING, TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT "ALL THE PERSONNEL ARE FINE AND WE ARE NOW EVACUATING SOME EMPLOYEES AND FOREIGNERS LIVING IN THE AREA, TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE CEASE-FIRE" THAT WAS ORDERED BY THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS FOR SEVERAL HOURS. "WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY GUERRILLAS. THE SOLDIERS ARE IN THE AREA AND ENTRANCE IS RESTRICTED. THEY ARE ONLY PERMITTING THE EVACUATION," THE OFFICIAL SAID OVER THE TELEPHONE. A SPOKESMAN OF THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE SAID THIS MORNING THAT THE ELITE COUNTERINSURGENCY BELLOSO AND ATLACATL BATTALIONS AND TROOPS WITH ARTILLERY ARE CARRYING OUT A SPECIAL OPERATION IN ESCALON TO DISLODGE THE REBELS. THE SPOKESMAN SAID THE OPERATION WILL INCLUDE ALL OF NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR. HOWEVER, HE SAID HE COULD NOT PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION BECAUSE "WE ARE STILL COMPILING INFORMATION." THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT ON 29 NOVEMBER RESUMED ITS ATTACKS IN SAN SALVADOR, ESPECIALLY IN THE UPPER CLASS NEIGHBORHOODS OF ESCALON, SAN BENITO, AND MAQUILISHUAT AND THE MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOODS OF JARDIN GUADALUPE, LA CIMA, AND LOMAS DE SAN FRANCISCO. AFTER SEVERAL HOURS OF FIGHTING IN THE STREETS OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS, THE ARMY SAID IT HAD THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL. HOWEVER, IT ADMITTED THAT THE REBELS HAD ENTRENCHED THEMSELVES IN ESCALON AND HAD SEIZED "THE RESIDENTS AS HOSTAGES." THE GUERRILLAS ANNOUNCED LAST NIGHT THAT FROM 0600 TO 1200 TODAY, 30 NOVEMBER, THEY "WILL UNDERTAKE THE EVACUATION OF FOREIGN PERSONNEL" IN THE ESCALON AND SAN BENITO NEIGHBORHOODS IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR. THE FMLN SAID THE MEASURE, WHICH IS BEING HEEDED BY THE FOREIGNERS LIVING IN THOSE AREAS, IS TO GUARANTEE THE LIVES OF THE RESIDENTS OF ESCALON. VARIOUS SOURCES SAID THE REBELS HAVE LEFT ESCALON, BUT THIS INFORMATION HAS YET TO BE CONFIRMED.
DEV-MUC3-0906	SAN SALVADOR, 30 NOV 89 -- THE CLANDESTINE AND LIAR RADIO STATIONS OF THE FMLN TERRORISTS CONTINUE TO CONDUCT A DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN AT AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL WITH THE PURPOSE OF DISTORTING THE TRUTH REGARDING THE AGGRESSION THESE BANDITS HAVE LAUNCHED AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. VERY FREQUENTLY THEY BROADCAST REPORTS OF UNIMAGINABLE MILITARY VICTORIES OF THE FMLN. THEIR LIAR RADIO STATIONS SAY THEY HAVE OCCUPIED THE MUNICIPALITIES OF SOYAPANGO, MEJICANOS, AYUTUXTEPEQUE, CIUDAD DELGADO, AND OTHERS, WHICH, DESPITE THE TRAGEDY WE ARE SUFFERING, MAKES PEOPLE BURST OUT LAUGHING BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS THESE ARE BIG LIES. THESE CLAIMS ARE ABSOLUTELY FALSE. THE RESIDENTS OF THOSE MUNICIPALITIES ARE GOING TO THEIR JOBS, BUSES ARE OPERATING, AND EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES ARE BEING CONDUCTED IN A NORMAL MANNER. THE LIAR RADIO STATIONS OF THE FMLN THINK THEY CAN CONFUSE THE PUBLIC OPINION WITH THEIR FALSE INFORMATION. THESE STATIONS ARE USED FOR PROPAGANDISTIC AND DISINFORMATION PURPOSES TO MAKE IT APPEAR AS IF THE FMLN IS WINNING MILITARY VICTORIES, WHICH THEY HAVE NEVER ATTAINED AND WHICH ARE ONLY IN THE MINDS OF ORTEGA'S PUPPETS, WHO BROADCAST FROM MANAGUA. THE PEOPLE ARE ASKING THEMSELVES: WHERE ARE THE COWARDLY TERRORIST AND MURDEROUS CHIEFS OF THE FMLN, SHAFIK HANDAL, JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, AND OTHER COWARDS, WHO ARE IN MANAGUA ENJOYING A LUXURIOUS LIFE AND GOOD FOOD? THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE FULLY AWARE OF THE VICTORIOUS ACTIONS OF OUR ARMED FORCES, WHO SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS GENOCIDAL AND TERRORIST FMLN OFFENSIVE HAVE FACED THE AGGRESSIVE MERCENARIES BY REDUCING THEM TO SMALL TERRORIST GROUPS, WHICH ARE LOST AND ARE IRRATIONALLY ATTACKING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. THE FMLN HAS RIDICULOUSLY CLAIMED TO COMPLETELY CONTROL CERTAIN MUNICIPALITIES. ALL OF THESE LIES SHOW THAT THE MURDEROUS FMLN LEADERS DO NOT HAVE ANY ARGUMENTS WITH WHICH TO CONCEAL THEIR UNSUCCESSFUL REBEL OFFENSIVE. THEIR GREATEST FAILURE HAS BEEN THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S REJECTION OF THE REBEL ACTIONS. DESPITE SO MANY THREATS MADE BY THE FMLN TERRORISTS, OUR PEOPLE HAVE NEVER SUPPORTED THEM, LET ALONE AGREED TO ACCEPT THE WEAPONS THAT THE FMLN WERE OFFERING THEM IF THEY JOINED THE REBELLION. THE FMLN AND ITS TERRORIST OFFENSIVE, WHICH WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE WEAPONS THAT DICTATOR ORTEGA HAS GIVEN TO THE FMLN PUPPETS, HAS FAILED, AND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE EXPECT THE NATIONS OF THE FREE WORLD TO CONDEMN THIS GENOCIDAL AGGRESSION OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM.
DEV-MUC3-0907	MOSCOW , 1 DEC 89 -- JUDGING BY NEWS AGENCY REPORTS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVENTS IN EL SALVADOR HAS REACHED AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS POINT. PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S REFUSAL TO RESPOND TO THE INSURGENTS' RECENT CEASE- FIRE PROPOSAL HAS RESULTED IN A FRESH OUTBREAK OF BLOODSHED. HAVING REJECTED OUT OF HAND LAST WEEK THE VERY IDEA OF THE RESUMPTION OF TALKS WITH THE FARABUNDO MARTI LIBERATION MOVEMENT, THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE NO SECRET OF ITS INTENTION OF QUICKLY DRIVING THE GUERRILLAS BACK INTO THE MOUNTAINS USING U.S. MILITARY SUPPLIES. "ELITE" ARMY BATTALIONS HAD ALREADY PREPARED FOR PUNITIVE ASSAULTS. BUT WHAT HAPPENED? THE REGIME'S GAMBLE ON MILITARY FORCE PROVED FUTILE. THE INSURGENTS REGROUPED THEIR FORCES, BROUGHT UP RESERVES, AND STRUCK A POWERFUL NEW BLOW. THE SALVADORAN DRAMA IS INCREASINGLY SHARPLY AT VARIANCE WITH THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE. REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED NATIONS, THE OAS, THE EEC, THE VATICAN, FRANCE, AND A NUMBER OF OTHER COUNTRIES AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOW STRESSING THE ACUTE NEED TO URGE THE WARRING SIDES IN EL SALVADOR TO REACH A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT BASED ON MUTUAL COMPROMISE. AND IT IS A VERY GREAT PITY THAT SUCH AN APPEAL HAS NOT COME FROM THAT CAPITAL WHICH THE SALVADORAN AUTHORITIES HEED ABOVE ALL OTHERS -- WASHINGTON. ATTENTION IS DRAWN TO THE URGENT EVACUATION OF U.S. CITIZENS FROM EL SALVADOR THAT WAS ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY. I RECOGNIZE THAT IN THE CONDITIONS OF AN ARMED CONFLICT THIS IS A NECESSARY STEP. BUT IT IS NO SECRET THAT IN THE RECENT PAST SUCH ACTIONS BY THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION WERE AN OMINOUS SYMPTOM OF THE PREPARATION OF OVERTLY INTERVENTIONIST PLANS. END THE BLOODSHED -- THAT IS THE PRIORITY TASK TODAY. AND THE RESTORATION OF THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE INSURGENTS THAT WAS BROKEN OFF SHOULD BE THE FIRST STEP TOWARD THAT.
DEV-MUC3-0908	SAN SALVADOR, 30 NOV 89 -- FOLLOWING A SOVIET ORDER, DANIEL ORTEGA HAS BEEN FORCED TO EXPELL FROM NICARAGUA THE FMLN TERRORIST LEADERS WHO FOR YEARS HAVE KEPT THEIR GENERAL COMMAND POST IN MANAGUA, WITH ORTEGA'S SUPPORT AND PROTECTION. WHEN THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT CONFIRMED THAT ORTEGA HAD SUPPLIED ARMS TO THE FMLN, WHICH WERE SECRETLY INTENDED FOR THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF THE SANDINIST ARMY -- AS WAS THE CASE OF THE SAM-7 MISSILES -- THEY ORDERED HIM TO STOP SUPPORTING THE FMLN TERRORISTS BECAUSE THIS IS ENDANGERING USSR AND U.S. RAPPROCHEMENT POLICIES. THE KREMLIN HAS REACTED WITH NOTICEABLE ANNOYANCE FOLLOWING FIDEL CASTRO AND DANIEL ORTEGA'S DIRECT MEDDLING, WHICH IS CAUSING SERIOUS DIVISIONS WITHIN THE LEADERSHIP OF THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT BECAUSE SOME OF THE COMMANDERS DID NOT AGREE ON SUPPORTING THE FMLN TERRORIST UPSURGE. THE EXPULSION ORDER FOR JORGE SHAFIK HANDAL, JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, AND OTHER FMLN LEADERS IS EXPECTED ANY MOMENT NOW. THIS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE FMLN'S POLITICAL CLOUT. AT THE SUMMIT MEETING BETWEEN THE SOVIET AND U.S. PRESIDENTS, CASTRO AND ORTEGA'S AGGRESSION, USING THE FMLN AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WILL BE REVIEWED FOLLOWING PRESIDENT ARIAS OF COSTA RICA'S INITIATIVE.
DEV-MUC3-0909	SAN SALVADOR, 30 NOV 89 -- IMMIGRATION DIRECTOR COLONEL MAXIMILIANO LEIVA REPORTED TODAY THAT 7 FOREIGNERS HAVE BEEN DEPORTED FROM EL SALVADOR AND 14 WILL HAVE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS AFTER BEING DECLARED "PERSONA NON GRATA" FOR ALLEGEDLY COLLABORATING WITH THE GUERRILLAS. LEIVA TOLD ACAN - EFE THAT AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF FOREIGNERS HAVE BEEN REMANDED TO THE COURTS, CHARGED WITH ARMS POSSESSION OR FOR TAKING PART IN ARMED ACTIONS IN COMPLICITY WITH THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT . LEIVA SAID THAT THE SEVEN DEPORTEES WILL BE "PERMANENTLY" BANNED SO THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RETURN TO EL SALVADOR. AMONG THE DEPORTED ARE U.S. CITIZENS, DUTCH, GERMANS, AND JAPANESE, ADDED LEIVA. THE SALVADORAN OFFICIAL DID NOT RELEASE THE NAMES OF THE DEPORTEES OR THE FOREIGNERS WHO WILL HAVE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS. JENNIFER CASOLO, A U.S. CITIZEN, WAS ARRESTED BY THE SECURITY CORPS AND ACCUSED OF "ARMS POSSESSION." GRABRIELA TORNAGO, AN ITALIAN, WAS ARRESTED AND ACCUSED OF "FINANCING, RECRUITING, AND BEING INVOLVED WITH TERRORIST GROUPS." ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SOURCES, CASOLA WAS ARRESTED AT DAYBREAK ON 26 NOVEMBER AT A HOUSE LOCATED IN THE "MIRAVALLE" NEIGHBORHOOD, WHERE THE ARMY CLAIMS TO HAVE FOUND A GREAT AMOUNT OF WEAPONS. TORNAGO WAS ARRESTED MORE THAN A WEEK AGO IN THE "PRADOS DE VENECIA" NEIGHBORHOOD. POLICE SOURCES SAID THAT THE ITALIAN WAS PREPARING A FAKE WEDDING AT HER RESIDENCE TO GATHER PEOPLE LINKED WITH THE GUERRILLAS, WHO ON 11 NOVEMBER STARTED AN ALLEGED "INSURRECTION." LEIVA ASSURED THAT THE FOREIGNERS WHO ARE LINKED TO THE GUERRILLAS WILL BE REMANDED TO THE COURTS BY THE SECURITY FORCE THAT MAKES THE ARREST.
DEV-MUC3-0910	CARACAS , 30 NOV 89 -- VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ REFERRED TODAY TO THE MURDER OF SIX JESUITS AND TWO WOMEN IN SAN SALVADOR AND SAID THAT "THERE IS A GENERALIZED SUSPICION THAT NO ONE CAN HIDE, AND IT IS THAT THE EXTREME RIGHT AND NOT THE EXTREME LEFT COMMITTED THESE MURDERS." PEREZ, WHO EXPRESSED HIS VIEWPOINTS ABOUT THE SALVADORAN SITUATION DURING HIS NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE MIRAFLORES PALACE, SAID THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THESE CRIMES BE INVESTIGATED AND THAT THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES BE PUNISHED. HE ADDED THAT HE HAS TELEPHONED SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH AND TOLD THEM ABOUT THIS. THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT SAID THAT IN SPITE OF THE FACT THE EVIDENCE POINTS IN ONE DIRECTION TO THE AUTHORS OF THE CRIMES COMMITTED ON 16 NOVEMBER, "WE CANNOT TAKE ANY SIDES IN THIS ISSUE, PARTICULARLY WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO FIND A SOLUTION, AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE DONE." CONCERNING THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO SUSPEND COOPERATION WITH THE GOVERNMENTS OF EL SALVADOR AND NICARAGUA, PEREZ POINTED OUT THAT THIS ACTION IS ONE WAY OF MAINTAINING AN ACTIVE NEUTRALITY. ACCORDING TO THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT, THE SPANISH STAND IS ONE OF COOPERATION SO THAT THERE WILL BE PEACE AND UNDERSTANDING IN CENTRAL AMERICA, BECAUSE IT IS WITHDRAWING THE AID AS LONG AS IT IS UNCLEAR HOW SERIOUS THE CONFLICTING PARTIES ARE ABOUT REACHING AN AGREEMENT.
DEV-MUC3-0911	SAN SALVADOR, 30 NOV 89 -- THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES STATED THIS EVENING THAT THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE "HAS FAILED AND HAS NOT REPRESENTED A MILITARY THREAT" TO THE ARMY FOLLOWING 19 DAYS OF STRONG REBEL ATTACKS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF 10 YEARS OF WAR. ARMY SPOKESMAN MAJOR MAURICIO CHAVEZ CACERES SAID THAT "FOLLOWING THE FAILURE OF THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE WHICH HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR OVER A YEAR, WHAT WE CAN EXPECT FROM THEM IS ATTACKS ON PROMINENT PEOPLE AND ON THE ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE, AND ACTIONS TO SCARE THE POPULATION." THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT RENEWED ITS ATTACKS EARLY ON 29 NOVEMBER WHEN IT ATTACKED THE COUNTRY'S MOST IMPORTANT MILITARY INSTALLATION AND SET FIRE TO A RESIDENCE OF U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS AND CONFRONTED THE ARMY IN EXCLUSIVE NEIGHBORHOODS IN NORTHWEST SAN SALVADOR. FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER AND PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE FRANCISCO JOSE GUERRERO DIED ON 28 NOVEMBER WHEN HE WAS STRAFFED BY GUERRILLAS, ACCORDING TO MILITARY SOURCES. THIS TOOK PLACE HOURS BEFORE THE RENEWED FIGHTING WHICH PRODUCED 40 CASUALTIES AMONG GUERRILLAS AND SOLDIERS. IN AN OFFICIAL RADIO AND TELEVISION BROADCAST, CHAVEZ CACERES TODAY ACCUSED THE FMLN OF DESTROYING SOME RESIDENCES IN THE EXCLUSIVE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD WITH DYNAMITE, IN NORTHWEST SAN SALVADOR, AND OF FIRING ON PRIVATE VEHICLES IN HIGH- AND MIDDLE-CLASS SAN SALVADOR NEIGHBORHOODS. THE MILITARY SPOKESMAN SAID: "THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DEAL A MILITARY BLOW; THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PUT UP A FIGHT WITH A SINGLE ARMY BATTALION OR COMPANY." THE FMLN GUERRILLAS TODAY VACATED THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD AFTER HOLDING, FOR OVER 24 HOURS, SEVERAL HOUSES THERE, FROM WHICH THEY CONFRONTED THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS. THE FMLN ANNOUNCED A TRUCE FROM 0600 TO 1200 TODAY TO EVACUATE FOREIGNERS, DIPLOMATS, AND CIVILIAN RESIDENTS FROM ESCALON. OVER 200 U.S. CITIZENS LEFT TODAY FOR THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF THE FIGHTING, PARTICULARLY IN ESCALON, A RESIDENTIAL AREA IN WHICH DIPLOMATS, HIGH-RANKING GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND POWERFUL BUSINESSMEN LIVE. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE ON 11 NOVEMBER, APPROXIMATELY 2,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND HUNDREDS HAVE BEEN WOUNDED IN THE FIGHTING BETWEEN SOLDIERS AND REBELS, WHICH HAS ALSO RESULTED IN SEVERE ECONOMIC LOSSES.
DEV-MUC3-0912	MANAGUA , 1 DEC 89 -- DOMINICAN ORDER SUPERIOR JUAN CARLOS FERNANDEZ CID REPORTED IN MANAGUA TODAY THAT A SPANISH PRIEST AND FOUR WORKERS OF THE DOMINICAN ORDER -- THREE SALVADORANS AND ONE U.S. CITIZEN -- WERE ARRESTED IN SAN SALVADOR ON 30 NOVEMBER. THE DOMINICAN SUPERIOR TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT THE SPANISH PRIEST CARLOS DIEZ ROJO; SALVADORANS JOSE SANTANA, THE DRIVER; ESTELA CRUZ BUSTAMANTE, DIRECTOR OF THE ORDER'S CHILD CARE CENTER; AND SANTIAGO DE JESUS VASQUEZ, DIRECTOR OF THE "22 APRIL" NEIGHBORHOOD CHOIR; AS WELL AS A U.S. VOLUNTEER CALLED SCOTT, WERE STILL UNDER ARREST IN SAN SALVADOR TODAY. HE STATED THAT HE HAD CONTACTED SPANISH EMBASSY OFFICIALS IN SAN SALVADOR THIS MORNING, AND THEY CONFIRMED THAT THE SAN SALVADOR TREASURY POLICE HAD ARRESTED THE PRIEST DIEZ ROJO AND THE FOUR WORKERS. ACCORDING TO FERNANDEZ CID, A GROUP OF POLICEMEN RAIDED THE PARISH CENTER IN CIUDAD CREDISA, A SAN SALVADOR NEIGHBORHOOD, AND ARRESTED THE FIVE PERSONS AFTER CONDUCTING A SEARCH. THE PRIEST WAS VISITING SAN SALVADOR AND HAD ARRIVED IN THE CITY 2 DAYS BEFORE THE GUERRILLAS LAUNCHED THEIR OFFENSIVE ON 11 NOVEMBER. A SPANISH EMBASSY OFFICIAL IN SAN SALVADOR IS PRESENTLY MAKING EFFORTS TO VISIT CARLOS DIEZ AND THE OTHER PERSONS ARRESTED, IN THE PRESENCE OF SALVADORAN OFFICIALS. WITHOUT ANY OFFICIAL EXPLANATIONS, TWO PRIESTS OF THE DOMINICAN ORDER -- SPANISH CITIZEN MIGUEL ANDUEZ AND THE U.S. CITIZEN JAIME BARNEE -- WERE EXPELLED FROM EL SALVADOR 5 DAYS AGO. ON 16 NOVEMBER, SIX JESUIT PRIESTS -- FIVE SPANIARDS AND ONE SALVADORAN -- AND TWO WOMEN WERE MURDERED BY 30 MEN IN UNIFORMS WHO WERE HEAVILY ARMED.
DEV-MUC3-0913	SAN SALVADOR, 30 NOV 89 -- SALVADORAN ATTORNEY GENERAL MAURICIO EDUARDO COLORADO HAS SAID THAT THE CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF WILL BE SUMMONED TO TESTIFY IN THE CASE OF THE MURDERED JESUIT PRIESTS. THE SALVADORAN OFFICIAL SAID THAT COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE MUST SAY WHAT MILITARY UNIT OF THE SECURITY CORPS WAS GUARDING THE AREA AROUND THE UCA THE DAY THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED. AT THIS TIME WE CONSIDER IT NECESSARY FOR US TO SUMMON COL PONCE AND FOR HIM TO TELL US THE NAME OF THE PERSON, SECURITY CORPS, OR HEADQUARTERS RESPONSIBLE FOR PATROLLING THE AREA WHERE THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED. ONCE WE KNOW WHO WAS IN THE AREA, WE WILL ALSO SUMMON THEM TO SEE WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY. MEANWHILE, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID THAT THE AMENDMENTS TO THE PENAL AND PENAL PROCEDURAL CODES APPROVED LAST WEEK BY THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY WILL CONTRIBUTE TOWARD THE LEGAL STRUGGLE AGAINST THE FMLN THAT THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY IS FULFILLING ITS HISTORIC TASK AT THIS MOMENT IS OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE. THE SALVADORAN SOLDIER WHO GIVES HIS LIFE FOR FREEDOM IS FULFILLING HIS MISSION AND THE LEGALLY APPOINTED AUTHORITIES ARE FULFILLING THEIR MISSION. ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, AT SUCH TIMES OF UNCERTAINTY CREATED BY THE INCREASE IN VIOLENCE, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE MUST REMAIN CALM AND NOT LOSE HOPE.
DEV-MUC3-0914	SAN SALVADOR, 1 DEC 89 -- FMLN GUERRILLAS FIRED A SAM-7 MISSILE ON 29 NOVEMBER FROM ZACATECOLUCA AND ON 30 NOVEMBER FIRED A SIMILAR MISSILE, ALSO FROM ZACATECOLUCA. BOTH MISSED THEIR TARGETS. THE AIR FORCES OFFICERS INVOLVED REPORTED THAT IN BOTH CASES THE SAM-7 MISSILES WERE DETECTED BY OBSERVER PLANES, WHICH IN TURN WARNED THE TWO SALVADORAN AIR FORCE A-37 PLANES THAT THE MISSILES WERE HEADED TOWARD THEM. THE TWO PLANES WERE FLYING PATROL MISSIONS IN THE ZACATECOLUCA AREA. BOTH SAM-7 MISSILES FAILED TO STRIKE THEIR TARGETS THANKS TO THE PROFESSIONALISM OF THE PILOTS, WHO MANEUVERED TO PREVENT THE FMLN MISSILES FROM HITTING THEM. THE FMLN CONTINUES TO RECEIVE SOVIET ARMS SUPPLIES THROUGH CUBA AND NICARAGUA, AN ACTION WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN OFFICIALLY DENOUNCED TO THE ENTIRE WORLD AND WHICH THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE FULLY REPUDIATE. THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT HAS SUPPLIED THE FMLN TERRORISTS WITH THIS TYPE OF SOPHISTICATED WEAPONRY OF SOVIET MANUFACTURE, WHICH CONFIRMS THAT THE FMLN, APART FROM HAVING ITS GENERAL COMMAND INSIDE NICARAGUAN TERRITORY, HAS THE MILITARY SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE OF THE SANDINIST REGIME. OFFICIAL SOURCES BELIEVE THAT THE SAM-7 MISSILES FIRED BY THE FMLN AGAINST THE AIR FORCE PLANES COULD BE AMONG THE WEAPONS THAT WERE ONBOARD THE OTHER SMALL PLANE THAT WAS SET ON FIRE BY THE TERRORISTS AFTER THEY HAD UNLOADED IT. AS SOON AS THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT LEARNED OF THE SAM-7 SHIPMENTS TO THE FMLN, THEY REPORTED IT TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. IN RESPONSE TO THIS REPORT, THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT, SHOWING GREAT ANNOYANCE, ORDERED A FREEZE ON ALL ARMS SHIPMENTS TO THE ORTEGA GOVERNMENT, WHICH, FOLLOWING ORDERS FROM FIDEL CASTRO, SUPPLIES MILITARY EQUIPMENT TO THE FMLN TERRORISTS. IT HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED THAT AN INVESTIGATION IS UNDER WAY ON THE PARTICIPATION OF MERCENARIES FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WHO ARE FIGHTING ALONGSIDE THE FMLN, CAUSING THE GENOCIDE OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.
DEV-MUC3-0915	MADRID , 1 DEC 89 -- NICARAGUA, WHICH WAS ACCUSED BY EL SALVADOR AT THE SECURITY COUNCIL ON 30 NOVEMBER OF WORSENING THE TENSION IN CENTRAL AMERICA, HAS ASKED THE SECURITY COUNCIL TO ISSUE A CALL FOR AN "IMMEDIATE" CEASE-FIRE AND FOR THE RESUMPTION OF NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS. ALEJANDRO SERRANO CALDERA, NICARAGUAN AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS, ALSO REQUESTED THAT THE COUNCIL ASK UN SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR "TO UNDERTAKE SPECIAL EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE AND SUPERVISE" A CEASE-FIRE IN EL SALVADOR. WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE DRAFT RESOLUTION PRESENTED BY NICARAGUA AND RELEASED TODAY, THE SECURITY COUNCIL LAST NIGHT SUSPENDED ITS MEETING, WHICH HAD BEEN REQUESTED BY EL SALVADOR TO REPORT NICARAGUAN SHIPMENTS OF WEAPONS, INCLUDING SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES, TO THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS. IN THE DRAFT RESOLUTION, NICARAGUA ASKED THE COUNCIL TO "VIGOROUSLY" CONDEMN THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS "BY A GROUP WEARING UNIFORMS" AS WELL AS "OTHER INDISCRIMINATE ACTS OF VIOLENCE, ESPECIALLY BOMBINGS" BY THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES DURING THE OFFENSIVE BEGUN BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT ON 11 NOVEMBER. IT ALSO URGED THE COUNCIL TO WORK FOR AN IMMEDIATE CEASE-FIRE IN EL SALVADOR AND FOR THE RESUMPTION OF NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN AS "THE ONLY WAY TO SOLVE" THE SALVADORAN CRISIS AND AS AN "UNPOSTPONABLE STEP" TO CONSOLIDATE THE REGIONAL PEACE PROCESS. THE DRAFT RESOLUTION REITERATED THE COUNCIL'S SUPPORT FOR THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE AGREEMENTS AND, IN CLEAR REFERENCE TO THE UNITED STATES, IT URGED THE COUNTRIES WITH LINKS OR INTERESTS IN THE REGION NOT TO INTERVENE IN THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT. ACCORDING TO NICARAGUA, THE SECURITY COUNCIL SHOULD ALSO EXPRESS ITS SATISFACTION WITH THE FORTHCOMING DEPLOYMENT OF THE UN OBSERVER GROUP IN CENTRAL AMERICA . THE FIRST GROUP FROM ONUCA IS SCHEDULED TO ARRIVE ON SUNDAY IN TEGUCIGALPA, WHERE ITS HEADQUARTERS WILL BE LOCATED.
DEV-MUC3-0916	SAN SALVADOR, 1 DEC 89 -- SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI TODAY SAID THAT THE SALVADORAN REBELS HAVE FIRED TWO SOVIET - MADE SURFACE - TO - AIR MISSILES SINCE THEY STARTED THEIR OFFENSIVE ON 11 NOVEMBER. ACCORDING TO CRISTIANI, THE MISSILES, WHICH "MISSED," WERE FIRED BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT IN ZACATECOLUCA, IN THE REGION'S CENTER, WHERE CLASHES BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE REBELS CONTINUED TODAY. CRISTIANI ADMITTED HE IS CONCERNED OVER "THE FMLN'S PLANS FOR STRICTLY TERRORIST ACTIONS," SUCH AS "KILLING PERSONALITIES, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND RELATIVES OF ARMED FORCES OFFICERS." HE ALSO SAID HIS GOVERNMENT HAS NOT REQUESTED ANY INTERNATIONAL MILITARY AID BECAUSE THE ARMED FORCES "CAN COUNTERACT THE FMLN ATTACKS" AND BECAUSE "THE GUERRILLA THREAT OF TAKING POWER IN THE COUNTRY BY FORCE IS NOT REAL." CRISTIANI ALSO SAID HE IS WILLING TO TALK WITH THE GUERRILLAS ONLY "IF HOSTILITIES CEASE." HE ASSERTED THAT THE FMLN ACTIONS "ARE LINKED TO DOMESTIC EVENTS IN NICARAGUA AND CUBA." THE PRESIDENT SAID HE IS "COMPLETELY SURE THE ARMED FORCES CAN CONTROL THE SITUATION BECAUSE THE GUERRILLAS ARE UNABLE TO SEIZE POWER BY FORCE AND DO NOT HAVE EVEN THE LEAST SUPPORT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE." CRISTIANI POINTED OUT: "WE CANNOT GIVE THE FMLN ANY CHANCES BECAUSE IT IS A MINORITY ARMED GROUP AIDED BY NICARAGUA AND CUBA, A GROUP WHUICH INTENDS TO SEIZE SOMETHING THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO." "IF THE GUERRILLAS WANT TO DIALOGUE, LET THEM STOP THEIR ARMED ACTIONS. IT IS HIGH TIME FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE PEOPLE WANT PEACE," THE PRESIDENT SAID. HE ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT "THE COFFEE, SUGAR, AND COTTON CROPS," THE COUNTRY'S MAIN EXPORT PRODUCTS, "WILL BE HARVESTED WITH ARMY RESERVISTS." THE GOVERNMENT HEADED BY CRISTIANI, WHICH TODAY COMPLETED 6 MONTHS, HAS ESTIMATED APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION IN ECONOMIC LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE BLOODY CLASHES BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE REBELS SINCE 11 NOVEMBER.
DEV-MUC3-0917	SAN SALVADOR, 30 NOV 89 -- COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE HAS SAID THAT IN LIGHT OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE USE OF MISSILES BY THE FMLN , THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE IS TAKING PRECAUTIONS AND HAS CHANGED ITS FLIGHT TACTICS OR ADOPTED NEW ONES. "THE ARMED FORCES IS DETERMINED TO CONFRONT THEM, AND TO ACHIEVE THEIR GOAL THE REBELS WILL HAVE TO STEP OVER THE BODIES OF EVERY SINGLE SOLDIER," COL PONCE SAID. COL PONCE ALSO SAID THAT THE ARREST OF U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER JEAN CASOLO, WHO WAS COVERING UP AN FMLN SAFEHOUSE, IS A HARD BLOW TO THE TERRORISTS BECAUSE CASOLO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR BRINGING CONGRESSIONAL STAFF AND REPRESENTATIVES OF CHURCHES AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS INTO THE COUNTRY. THESE PEOPLE APPARENTLY CAME TO THE COUNTRY TO PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN AID TO THE DISPLACED. PONCE ALSO SAID THAT MANY INTERNATIONALISTS JOIN THE TERRORIST GROUPS, THUS VIOLATING THE RIGHTS OF ALL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. PONCE SAID THAT THE LEADERS OF THE FRONT GROUPS DEFINED THEIR POSITIONS WHEN THEY JOINED THE FMLN TO CARRY OUT THE SO-CALLED FINAL OFFENSIVE, WHICH HAS PROVEN TO BE A TOTAL FAILURE BECAUSE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE BELIEVE IN DEMOCRACY AND NOT COMMUNISM. THE CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF ALSO MET WITH FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS. HE SAID THAT THE FMLN CURRENTLY HAS THE SUPPORT OF ONLY NICARAGUA, CUBA, AND RUSSIA , BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE THE ESSENTIAL SUPPORT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE; THEREFORE, THYE ARE DOOMED TO POLITICAL-MILITARY FAILURE. ALL THE FMLN HAS LEFT IS ITS PROPAGANDA TACTICS AT THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. COL PONCE TALKED ABOUT THE CASUALTIES INFLICTED ON THE FMLN TERRORISTS THROUGH 0600 ON 28 NOVEMBER. PONCE SAID THAT 1,680 REBELS HAD BEEN KILLED AND MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT NUMBER WOUNDED. COL PONCE ADDED THAT THE ARMY REGRETS THE HEROIC DEATHS OF 398 SOLDIERS AND APPROXIMATELY 800 WOUNDED IN CLASHES SINCE 11 NOVEMBER.
DEV-MUC3-0918	SAN SALVADOR, 1 DEC 89 -- SALVADORAN PEOPLE. IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT LABOR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE UNTS , CRIPDES , FECMASAN, AND OTHERS ARE SIMPLY POLITIAL FRONTS OF THE FMLN BECAUSE THEIR LEADERS HAVE DIRECTLY PARTICIPATED IN THE TERRORIST OFFENSIVE AGAINST HONEST AND HARD-WORKING CITIZENS. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS UNTS TERRORIST GUILLERMO ROJAS, WHO LED TO THEIR DEATHS MANY YOUTHS WHO WERE DECEIVED WITH FALSE COMMUNIST MOTTOS. THESE PEOPLE WILL HAVE ON THEIR CONSCIENCES -- IF THEY HAVE ANY -- THE SPILLED BLOOD OF CHILDREN, YOUNG PEOPLE, ELDERLY PEOPLE, AND WOMEN WHO FELL VICTIM TO THE ABUSES OF THESE VILE MURDERERS. SAY NO TO THE FALSE UNION LEADERS. SAY YES TO PEACE AND DEMOCRACY!
DEV-MUC3-0919	SAN SALVADOR, 1 DEC 89 -- THE NATIONAL GUARD HAS CAPTURED THE ACTUAL PERPETRATORS, AS WELL AS ACCOMPLICES AND HARBORERS, IN THE CASE OF THE ATTACK ON THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF ON 30 OCTOBER. THE NATIONAL GUARD REPORTED THAT IT ARRESTED 15 PEOPLE LAST WEEK AT VARIOUS PLACES IN HERE IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER PERSONS AT THE OFFICES OF THE SO-CALLED AWARENESS FOR SPIRITUAL AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY OF MAN , AT THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH ON 63 SOUTH AVENUE AND OLIMPICA AVENUE IN SAN SALVADOR. SEVERAL PERSONS WHO WERE HELD HOSTAGE THERE ON 30 OCTOBER LATER APPEARED AT THE CENTRAL POLICE HEADQUARTERS TO REPORT THE ABUSE. WHEN NATIONAL GUARD PERSONNEL BEGAN THE SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION THAT SAME DAY, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE ARRESTED PERSONS HAD COMMITTED OTHER ACTIONS IN VIOLATION OF OUR LAWS AND AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S SECURITY. AFTER DETERMINING THAT THIS EPISCOPAL CHURCH WAS VISITED BY PERSONS INVOLVED IN SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES AND THAT IT HARBORED A GROUP THAT IS AN FMLN FRONT, THE PLACE WAS SEARCH AND IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT, IN ADDITION TO THE CHURCH, OFFICES OF CREDHO ALSO OPERATED THERE -- CREDHO IS AN AFFILIATE OF AN ORGANIZATION THEY CALL DIACOMIAS; THAT 60 PERSONS ARE EMPLOYED THERE; THAT MOST OF THOSE PERSONS ARE NOT PARISHIONERS, BUT CREDHO EMPLOYEES; THAT CREDHO'S DIRECTOR IS A PRIEST OF SPANISH ORIGIN NAMED LUIS SERRANO LORENTE; AND THAT THIS PRIEST IS NOW A NATURALIZED SALVADORAN. THERE THE NATIONAL GUARD PERSONNEL ARRESTED JOSE HORACIO GUZMAN RIVAS, JOSE EDUARDO SANCHEZ CASTILLO, LUIS GUSTAVO LOPEZ MAGANA, JOSE VIDAL ENAMORADO DIAZ, ELBA RUTH ALFARO VALENCIA, ALEX ANTONIO TOVAR FLORES, JOSE CANDELARIO AGUILAR ALVAREZ, AND RANDOLFO CAMPO BENAVIDES. IN CONNECTION WITH THE SAME CASE, THEY ALSO ARRESTED JUAN ANTONIO VERSICO NUNEZ, ANA JULIO RODRIGUEZ, AND JOSE FRANCISCO PASTORANGES AT VARIOUS PLACES IN THE CIUDAD SATELITE NEIGHBORHOOD. LATER ON, LUIS SERRANO LORENTE, PASTOR OF THIS ANGLICAN CHURCH, WAS ARRESTED IN THE LOMAS VERDES NEIGHBORHOOD. JULIO CESAR CASTRO RAMIREZ AND JULIO EUGENIA AGUILERA ESCOBAR WERE LATER ARRESTED IN SANTA ANA, AND, LASTLY, AIDA MARGARITA GOMEZ DE LEON WAS ARRESTED IN THE DON BOSCO RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD IN SANTA TECLA. SERRANO SAID HE IS THE DIRECTOR OF CREDHO AND RESPONSIBLE FOR THE AFOREMENTIONED CHURCH. HE ASSERTED THAT HE LEARNED ON 29 OCTOBER THAT IN THE CHURCHYARD TWO TRUCKS WERE LOADED WITH EXPLOSIVES, WHICH WERE HURLED THE NEXT DAY AT THE MILITARY COMPLEX OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF. HE DECIDED TO REMAIN SILENT ABOUT THIS, THEREBY COVERING FOR THE TERRORIST CRIMINALS WHO MURDER HUMBLE WORKING PEOPLE. SERRANO ALSO SAID THAT CREDHO IS FINANCED BY A FRONT GROUP CALLED DIACOMIAS, WHICH HAS NO LEGAL STATUS, BUT IS THE CHANNEL FOR AID THAT IS SENT IN CASH BY SO-CALLED SOLIDARITY CHURCHES AND ASSOCIATIONS ORGANIZED IN SWEDEN, BRITAIN, NETHERLANDS, CANADA, THE UNITED STATES, AND AUSTRALIA. THIS MONEY IS DISTRIBUTED TO LUTHERAN, CATHOLIC, EMANUEL BAPTIST, AND EPISCOPAL CHURCHES, AS WELL AS TO THE FOUNDATION FOR PROMOTION OF COOPERATIVES AND THE FEDERATION OF COOPERATIVES FOR DEVELOPMENT . THESE GROUPS COMPRISE DIACOMIAS AND TWICE A MONTH, ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM EACH GROUP MEETS AT THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH TO DISCUSS DISTRIBUTION OF THESE LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY, MOST OF WHICH, HE SAID, IS DELIVERED TO LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THEY HAVE ORGANIZED THAT ARE DIRECTED BY THE FMLN FRONT GROUPS.
DEV-MUC3-0920	BOGOTA, 1 DEC 89 -- FELLOW PATRIOTS, I AM ADDRESSING THE NATION TODAY TO EXPLAIN THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION CONCERNING THE ISSUE OF EXTRADITION, WHICH WAS THE SUBJECT OF A VERY INTENSE DEBATE LAST NIGHT AT THE CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES' FIRST COMMISSION. A PROPOSAL WAS PUT FORWARD TO THE EFFECT THAT IN THE EXTRAORDINARY REFERENDUM SCHEDULED FOR 21 JANUARY -- WHICH IS CONTEMPLATED IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM THAT IS CURRENTLY IN ITS FINAL STAGES -- AN ADDITIONAL QUESTION BE INCLUDED WITH REGARD TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU, THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE, WANT COLOMBIAN CRIMINALS TO BE EXTRADITED. THIS QUESTION WOULD JOIN FOUR OTHER ISSUES THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN APPROVED FOR SUBMISSION TO POPULAR CONSULTATION ON 21 JANUARY. ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER IMMEDIATELY EXPRESSED THE DISADVANTAGES OF APPROVING THAT PROPOSAL. I HAVE CONSULTED WITH FORMER PRESIDENTS ALBERTO LLERAS, CARLOS LLERAS RESTREPO, ALFONSO LOPEZ, AND JULIO CESAR TURBAY ABOUT INCLUDING THE EXTRADITION ISSUE IN THE REFERENDUM, AND THEY FEEL THAT WITH THE CURRENT PUBLIC ORDER SITUATION, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN DEALING SUCCESSFULLY WITH THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, IT WOULD BE DISADVANTAGEOUS TO USE THE REFERENDUM TO DECIDE ON EXTRADITION. THE COUNTRY MUST NOT DECEIVE ITSELF AS TO WHERE WE WOULD BE HEADED IF WE HELD A REFERENDUM ON THE ISSUE OF EXTRADITION, AND AS TO THE FATAL CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH AN ACTION ON THE COUNTRY'S MORALE AND ON DEMOCRACY'S SURVIVAL. INITIALLY, I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT EXTRADITING COLOMBIAN CRIMINALS FOR THEM TO STAND TRIAL IN OTHER COUNTRIES, BUT OF EXTRADITING DRUG TRAFFICKERS WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES ABROAD. EXTRADITION IS NOT PUNISHMENT FOR SOCIETY BECAUSE IT REFERS ONLY TO DRUG TRAFFICKERS, NEITHER IS IT AN AFFRONT TO SOVEREIGNTY, AS SOME PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO PORTRAY IT. EXTRADITION HAS BEEN DEALT WITH IN COLOMBIAN INTERNATIONAL TREATIES. THE DIRECTION OF INTERNATIONAL POLICY LIES WITHIN THE EXCLUSIVE REALM OF THE PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC, ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION. CONGRESS CANNOT TAKE THE INITIATIVE OF ABOLISHING PUBLIC EXTRADITION TREATIES BY RESORTING TO LEGISLATIVE OR CONSTITUENT PROVISIONS. THIS IS CLEAR IN LIGHT OF COLOMBIAN PUBLIC LAW, AND IT IS IMPERATIVE ACCORDING TO THE VIENNA CONVENTION, WHICH COLOMBIA RECENTLY APPROVED. ACCORDING TO THIS CONVENTION, THE EXTRADITION TREATY WILL PREVAIL OVER INTERNAL PROVISIONS. IN OTHER WORDS, THE TREATIES THAT COLOMBIA HAS SIGNED WITH REGARD TO EXTRADITION CANNOT BE DISREGARDED THROUGH INTERNAL LEGISLATION. THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE THROUGH DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS SUCH AS DENOUNCING THE TREATIES AND DIRECTLY INFORMING THE COUNTERPART. FOR 100 YEARS COLOMBIAN LAW HAS AUTHORIZED THE EXTRADITION OF CRIMINALS. I REPEAT, 100 YEARS, SINCE 1888, AND ONLY NOW, WHEN EXTRADITION IS APPLIED TO DRUG TRAFFICKERS, ARE THERE OBJECTIONS TO ITS ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF SOVEREIGNTY. PRACTICALLY ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTION, HAVE AND APPLY TREATIES TO EXTRADITE TERRORISTS OR WHOMEVER COMMITS CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY, SUCH AS DRUG TRAFFICKING. OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS, NO MORE THAN 30 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EXTRADITED TO SEVERAL COUNTRIES THAT REQUESTED THE EXTRADITIONS AND COMPLIED WITH THE NECESSARY LAWS. THEREFORE, EXTRADITION IS NOT A GENERAL THREAT AGAINST ALL COLOMBIANS. IT ONLY AFFECTS THOSE WHO HAVE COMMITTED THE CRIME OF DRUG TRAFFICKING ABROAD. SECONDLY, SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT EXTRADITION HAS CREATED VIOLENCE AND, THEREFORE, WITH ITS ELIMINATION, VIOLENCE WOULD DISAPPEAR. NEITHER IS TRUE. THE VIOLENCE PERPETRATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAD BEEN SUFFERED PRIOR TO THE 1979 EXTRADITION TREATY. AFTER THE TREATY WENT INTO EFFECT, HUNDREDS OF COLOMBIANS WERE MURDERED, INCLUDING JUSTICE MINISTER RODRIGO LARA BONILLA. IN DECEMBER 1986, A SUPREME COURT DECISION LEFT THE EXTRADITION TREATY INAPPLICABLE. IN OTHER WORDS, AFTER THIS, WHILE EXTRADITION WAS INAPPLICABLE, ATTORNEY GENERAL CARLOS MAURO HOYOS WAS SLAIN, BOGOTA MAYOR ANDRES PASTRANA WAS KIDNAPPED, AND NEWSMAN GUILLERMO CANO, POLITICAL LEADER JAIME PARDO LEAL, AND HUNDREDS OF COLOMBIANS WERE SACRIFICED.
DEV-MUC3-0921	BOGOTA, 1 DEC 89 -- LAST YEAR, WITHOUT EXTRADITION IN EFFECT, OVER 600 ANONYMOUS COLOMBIAN PEASANTS WERE MURDERED IN MORE THAN 40 MASSACRES BY HIRED ASSASSINS PAID BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS. THERE IS EVEN MORE: LET US NOT FORGET ANTIOQUIA GOVERNOR ANTONIO ROLDAN BETANCUR, MAGISTRATE CARLOS VALENCIA, COLONEL FRANKLYN QUINTERO, AND SENATOR LUIS CARLOS GALAN WHO WERE MURDERED WHEN EXTRADITION WAS NOT IN EFFECT. LET US NOT SAY THAT EXTRADITION HAS BROUGHT US VIOLENCE. A POSTER FOUND AT THE FARM RAIDED LAST WEEK, FROM WHERE PABLO ESCOBAR ESCAPED READ: EXTRADITION IS VIOLENCE. LET US NOT BE FOOLED; VIOLENCE HAS BEEN USED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS BY MURDERING, WHILE FLEEING FROM THE REACTION OF JUSTICE, AND INTIMIDATING COLOMBIAN SOCIETY. IT HAS ALSO BEEN SAID THAT EXTRADITION IS UNDIGNIFIED BECAUSE IT SENDS COLOMBIANS ABROAD TO BE TRIED, AND THAT IT IS MORE DIGNIFIED FOR THEM TO BE TRIED AND CONDEMNED IN THE COUNTRY BY OUR OWN JUDGES. THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, HOWEVER, HAVE SENT MORE THAN 200 COLOMBIAN JUDGES AND JUDICIAL BRANCH OFFICIALS TO THEIR GRAVE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE MURDER OF DR GUILLERMO CANO HAS MEANT THE DEATH OF WITNESSES, JUDICIAL OFFICIALS, AND LAWYERS AND INTIMIDATION AND THREATS TO ALL THOSE WHO WANT TO COOPERATE WITH JUSTICE TO RESOLVE A CRIME. HOW THEN CAN WE BELIEVE THESE DRUG TRAFFICKERS? CAN WE BELIEVE THAT EXTRADITION HAS CAUSED THIS VIOLENCE? CAN WE HAVE A FREE AND DIGNIFIED COUNTRY WITH THESE BANDS OF MULTIMILLIONAIRE MURDERERS? I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY THE GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS IT HARMFUL AND DANGEROUS TO SUBMIT EXTRADITION TO A REFERENDUM. WE KNOW THAT EXTRADITION IS ONLY FOR DRUG TRAFFICKERS. WE KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE DONE AND WHAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF DOING. WE HAVE SUFFERED FROM THEIR TERRORIST ACTIONS. MANY BRAVE COLOMBIANS HAVE BEEN MURDERED FOR THE SIMPLE REASON OF NOT AGREEING WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT ON THIS TOPIC OF EXTRADITION THERE COULD BE A CLEAN ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN, FREE FROM INTIMIDATION? DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO ARE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING CAN, WITHOUT FEAR, GIVE THEIR OPINION? IT WOULD BE A CAMPAIGN SLANTED BY TERRORISM, INTIMIDATION, AND DRUG TRAFFICKERS' MONEY. THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT SUBJECT CITIZENS TO AN ELECTORAL PROCESS THAT WOULD NOT BE TO CONVINCE COLOMBIANS, BUT TO INTIMIDATE THEM. A REFERENDUM IS FOR PEOPLE TO EXPRESS THEIR FREE AND SOVEREIGN DECISION ON A TOPIC OF GENERAL INTEREST. TO INCLUDE EXTRADITION IN THE REFERENDUM WOULD ONLY SERVE SO THAT A HANDFUL -- LESS THAN 100 -- DRUG TRAFFICKERS CAN, BY USING THEIR MONEY AND TERROR, INTIMIDATE PUBLIC OPINION, THE MEDIA, AND ALL COLOMBIANS, SO AS TO AVOID BEING TRIED AND CONDEMNED FOR CRIMES THAT THEY HAD COMMITTED ABROAD. CONDITIONS OF TERRORISM DO NOT ALLOW THIS TOPIC TO BE DECIDED FREELY. I CALL FOR GOOD SENSE, FOR SENSIBLENESS, SO THAT THE DARK INTERESTS OF A FEW PRIVATE PEOPLE ARE NOT CONFUSED WITH THE GENERAL INTEREST OF ALL COLOMBIANS. I CALL FOR COLOMBIANS NOT TO ALLOW THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS THAT ARE IN THE FINAL DISCUSSION, OR THE FIRST REFERENDUM IN OVER 30 YEARS, TO BE USED IN AN OPPORTUNISTIC WAY TO SERVE SELFISH INTERESTS. THE GOVERNMENT IS CONVINCED THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS AND THE EXTRAORDINARY REFERENDUM WILL BE AN IMPORTANT ADVANCEMENT FOR THE INSTITUTIONS. THEY WILL ALLOW GREATER PARTICIPATION BY THE PEOPLE IN STATE DECISIONS, IN CONGRESS, AND ARE WITHOUT DOUBT A STEP TOWARD PEACE. I KNOW THERE ARE SOME WHO SAY THAT DRUG TRAFFICKERS WANT PEACE AND TRANQUILITY. I WANT TO SAY THAT ELIMINATING EXTRADITION WILL NOT BRING TRANQUILITY, BUT IMPUNITY AND MORE VIOLENCE. THIS IS WHY IT IS ADVISABLE THAT PARLIAMENTARIANS NOT ALLOW INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES TO BE ENDANGERED OR THE PEACE ACCORDS BE PUT TO SERIOUS RISK DUE TO THE INCLUSION IN THE REFERENDUM OF A TOPIC THAT NOT ONLY WOULD NOT BE GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY, BUT WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO ALL COLOMBIANS. AS IS PUBLICLY KNOWN, I WILL TRAVEL ON 3 DECEMBER AT THE OFFICIAL INVITATION OF THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT. THIS IS PART OF COLOMBIA'S OPENING TO THE PACIFIC. THERE, I SHALL MEET WITH EMPEROR AKIHITO; WITH PRIME MINISTER TOSHIKI KAIFU; WITH THE LEGISLATIVE CHAMBERS; WITH INDUSTRIAL, POLITICAL, AND ACADEMIC LEADERS; AND WITH JAPANESE GOVERNMENT LENDING AND TRADE ENTITIES. THERE, I SHALL PRESENT A TRUE PICTURE OF COLOMBIA -- A COUNTRY WITH DIFFICULTIES, BUT WITH THE NATIONAL RESOLVE TO OVERCOME THEM. WE ARE A COUNTRY WITH A PROMISING FUTURE, WITH HARD-WORKING PEOPLE, AND WITH VAST NATURAL RESOURCES. A FEW CRIMINALS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SNATCH THAT FUTURE FROM US. GOOD NIGHT, AND SEE YOU SOON.
DEV-MUC3-0922	HAVANA , 2 DEC 89 -- OSCAR ORAMAS, THE CUBAN AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS, HAS STATED THAT THE ARMS SUPPLIED BY THE UNITED STATES AND THE HUNDREDS OF U.S. ADVISERS SENT TO EL SALVADOR ARE THE CAUSE OF THE TERROR THAT SALVADORANS HAVE HAD TO ENDURE FOR MORE THAN 10 YEARS. ORAMAS CHARGED THAT THE U.S. ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN THE MAIN CAUSE OF THE TORTURE, MURDERS, AND DISAPPEARANCES THAT HAVE BECOME A DAILY OCCURRENCE IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN NATION. ORAMAS ADDED THAT DESPITE THE GREAT EFFORT MADE BY THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION TO CONCEAL ITS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE VIOLENCE PREVAILING IN EL SALVADOR, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WILL NOT BE DECEIVED AND THE FACTS THAT WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY WILL SHOW THAT THE PEOPLES HAVE POINTED THEIR ACCUSING FINGERS AT THE UNITED STATES. THE CUBAN DIPLOMAT REBUTTED THE U.S. CHARGES AIMED AT SHIFTING RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR COUNTRY FOR THE SALVADORAN SITUATION. THE U.S. CHARGES WERE TO BE EXPECTED, ORAMAS SAID.
DEV-MUC3-0923	GUATEMALA CITY, 3 DEC 89 -- CENTRAL AMERICAN BISHOPS ARE "VERY WORRIED" OVER THE SITUATION OF THE CHURCH AND THE PEOPLE IN EL SALVADOR AND PANAMA, "WHO ARE ENDURING A DIFFICULT TRIAL," ACCORDING TO A DOCUMENT ISSUED BY THE EPISCOPAL SECRETARIAT OF CENTRAL AMERICA AND PANAMA . IN THE DOCUMENT, SIGNED BY 42 AREA BISHOPS, THE BISHOPS "EXPRESS APPRECIATION FOR THE COURAGEOUS, EVANGELIC, AND PATRIOTIC ATTITUDE OF THE PANAMANIAN CHURCH, GUIDED BY ITS TRUE CLERGYMEN, IN FACING THE DOUBLE AGGRESSION THEY ARE ENDURING." PANAMA IS ENDURING "EXTERNAL SANCTIONS THAT IMPOVERISH THE COUNTRY, ALONG WITH THE OPEN DENIAL OF FUNDAMENTAL GUARANTEES AND RIGHTS TO THOSE WHO DISAGREE WITH THE POLICY OF THE CURRENT PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT," THE DOCUMENT ADDS. REGARDING EL SALVADOR, "WE ARE HURT" BY THE SUFFERING, DEATH, AND DESTRUCTION CAUSED BY THE ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE EL SALVADOR HAS BEEN ENDURING FOR A DECADE. "THE USE OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION FOR THE PROTECTION OF ARMED GROUPS, THE INTENSE BOMBINGS OVER DENSELY POPULATED AREAS , AND THE USE OF THE MEDIA TO STIR UP PEOPLE'S FEELINGS AND INCREASE HATRED AMONG BROTHERS ARE ALL REPULSIVE," THE SEDAC DOCUMENT STATES. THE SEDAC RECALLS THAT AMONG THE WAR VICTIMS ARE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS, WHO, FROM THEIR TEACHING PODIUMS, TRIED TO SHAPE MORAL AND JUST CONSCIENCES AMONG THE FUTURE BUILDERS OF SOCIETY. IT ALSO CONDEMNS THE "BRUTAL WAY IN WHICH THEY WERE MASSACRED, WHICH PROVES HOW FAR DOWN THE MORAL SENSE AND HUMAN QUALITY OF THOSE WHO PERPETRATED THE CRIME HAS FALLEN." REGARDING PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, THE HIGHEST RANKING LEADERS OF THE CHURCH IN THE AREA POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE MANY FACTORS PREVENTING OR HAMPERING EFFORTS TO BUILD A LONG LASTING PEACE. AMONG THE FACTORS THE BISHOPS MENTION IS "THE PERSISTENCE OF SERIOUS SOCIAL PROBLEMS -- HUNGER, UNEMPLOYMENT, THE HIGH COST OF LIVING, AND THE REALITY OF AN UNDERPRIVILEGED CLASS -- YET MOST RULERS AND OTHER BODIES HOLDING POWER DO NOT SHOW ANY DESIRE TO ELIMINATE THESE FACTORS." IN ADDITION, THE "CRIMINAL STUBBORNNESS" OF SEARCHING FOR A MILITARY AND ARMED SOLUTION TO THE SITUATION OF VIOLENCE HAS GENERATED "THE DEEPLY ROOTED UNJUSTICE IN OUR REALITY, WHICH IS AGGRAVATED BY THE OUTRAGEOUS MEDDLING OF FOREIGN SUPERPOWERS." "THE INTEREST OF A GROUP OR IDEOLOGIES PREVAIL OVER THE NEEDS AND RIGHTS OF CITIZENS," THE SEDAC DOCUMENTS STATES. THE HEADS OF THE CHURCHES OF THE SIX ISTHMIAN COUNTRIES ADD THAT THIS HASTENS THE "CRIMINAL AND IMMORAL" ARMS BUILDUP, WHICH, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF COSTA RICA, HAS LED PEOPLE IN THE AREA INTO INCREASING IMPOVERISHMENT AND A RISE IN THEIR FOREIGN DEBT. "THE SMUGGLING OF WEAPONS TO STRENGTHEN SUBVERSIVE MOVEMENTS OF VARIOUS TENDENCIES IS NO LESS OUTRAGEOUS AND CRIMINAL THAN THE EXISTENCE OF DEATH SQUADS OR PARAMILITARY GROUPS," THE SEDAC DOCUMENT ADDS. IT IS WORRYING TO SEE HOW SOME NATIONS IN THE AREA PROMOTE CAMPAIGNS SUCH AS "AN EYE FOR AN EYE AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH" , OR PROMOTE "ANTITERRORIST" LAWS THAT CAN BE USED FOR THE OUTRAGEOUS ABUSE OF POWER IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE ADVERSARIES, THE BISHOPS POINTED OUT. TO ALL THESE EVILS ONE MUST ADD THE FLIGHT OF CAPITAL, THE INCREASING DRUG TRAFFICKING, AND THE RESULTING CORRUPTION, VIOLENCE, AND DEATH.
DEV-MUC3-0924	CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- NOW THEY ARE STILL DOING THE SAME THING, EXCEPT THAT THE KILLINGS ARE THOSE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE PLACES BURNED ARE HOMES IN THE DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE UN HEADQUARTERS, AND THOSE ACCUSED OF COLLABORATING WITH THE FMLN ARE THE EPISCOPAL CHURCHES. THE STRATEGY IS THE SAME. THE FMLN CONTINUES TO STRIKE AT AND MOCK THE ARMED FORCES. FAR FROM DIMINISHING IN NUMBER, IT HAS INCREASED IN NUMBER. THE PERSECUTION OF THE CHURCH, THE INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS, THE PRESS CENSORSHIP, AND, ABOVE ALL, THE APPARENT DIRECTION TAKEN BY THE SITUATION AS A RESULT OF THE ARMED FORCES' LEADERSHIP HAVE SHOWN THE WORLD THAT NOTHING HAS CHANGED. THE MILITARY CONTINUES TO BE IN COMMAND, AND CRISTIANI'S MODERATION WAS BUT A COSTLY MAKEOVER. THE U.S. ANALYSTS ARE BEGINNING TO REACT. AFTER 9 YEARS OF INVESTING AT ALL LEVELS TO PUT AN END TO THE CAPITAL AND THE PRINCIPAL CITIES OF THE COUNTRY WITH A STRATEGIC SIEGE, WITH THE THEATER OF OPERATIONS IN THE TROUBLE SPOTS, AND WITHOUT ANY PROSPECT OF CONTROLLING THE SITUATION, THE ORDER OF THE DAY IN THE HALLS OF CONGRESS IS A CHANGE OF POLICY AND THE PROMOTION OF NEGOTIATION. ALL THE WORLD IS SUFFERING DEEPLY, WITHOUT THE HOPE OF A CHANGE OF POLICY. WHAT THE U.S. CONGRESS IS STUDYING IS WHETHER IT WILL CONTINUE WITH THAT POLICY WHICH DOES NOT CHANGE AT ALL, WHICH PROTECTS THE ASSASSINS OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO, THE FOUR U.S. NUNS, IGNACIO ELLACURIA, AND FIVE MORE JESUITS. IT IS STUDYING WHETHER IT IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A FASCIST PARTY AND A CRIMINAL-RIDDEN ARMED FORCES AND THUS CONDEMN THIS PART OF THE WORLD SO CLOSE TO THEIR BORDERS TO TERRIBLE SUFFERING, OR WHETHER THE TIME OF CHANGE HAS ARRIVED IN THE UNITED STATES. THE POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR MUST BE CHANGED TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF DEMOCRACY SO THAT PLURALISM WILL GIVE WAY TO DEMOCRACY, JUSTICE, AND PEACE. THE UNITED STATES CAN CONTRIBUTE TO PEACE IN EL SALVADOR, BUT IN ORDER TO DO SO IT MUST CHANGE ITS POLICY.
DEV-MUC3-0925	SAN SALVADOR, 4 DEC 89 -- OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT TROOPS FROM THE THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE AND THE ATONAL BATTALION HAVE ENGAGED IN HEAVY FIGHTING WITH THE FMLN TERRORIST CRIMINALS ON THREE OCCASIONS AS THE LATTER HAVE TRIED TO ENTER THE CITY OF USULUTAN. SPOKESMEN FOR THE ATONAL BATTALION HAVE ASSERTED THAT THEIR BATTALION INFLICTED A LARGE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES ON THE COMMUNIST MURDERERS AND SEIZED SOVIET WEAPONS DURING THE LATEST FIGHTING. MEANWHILE, TROOPS OF THE LEON BATTALION REPORTED THAT THEY KILLED TWO TERRORIST CRIMINALS DURING A SKIRMISH IN LAS DELICIAS, SAN MIGUEL JURISDICTION. THE SOURCES SAID THAT THE SOLDIERS SEIZED ONE 60 MM MORTAR, ONE GRENADE OF THE TYPE LAUNCHED WITH CATAPULTS, AND OTHER WAR SUPPLIES. THEY ADDED THAT THE TROOPS FOUND 1 M-16 RIFLE, 1,500 ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION, AND VARIOUS TYPES OF EXPLOSIVES ABANDONED IN EL TULAR VILLAGE, ALSO IN SAN MIGUEL. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE CONGRATULATE THE BRAVE ARMED FORCES SOLDIERS AND URGE THEM TO CONTINUE THEIR STRUGGLE AGAINST THE FMLN'S MURDEROUS TERRORISTS.
DEV-MUC3-0926	LA PAZ, 4 DEC 89 -- THE POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS THAT RESULTED IN JAIME PAZ ZAMORA'S INSTALLATION AS PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC WILL AGAIN TAKE PLACE IN THE NEXT WEEKS TO DECIDE WHO WILL BE INSTALLED AS MAYOR OF LA PAZ. THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS HELD YESTERDAY DID NOT CLEARLY INDICATE WHO WILL BE THE MAYOR OF THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST CITY, WHERE THE CANDIDATES OF THE POPULIST NEW POLITICAL GROUPS AND THOSE OF THE TRADITIONAL PARTIES RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY THE SAME NUMBER OF VOTES. ACCORDING TO UNOFFICIAL RETURNS RELEASED BY THE PRIVATE TELEVISION CHANNELS, WHICH IN PREVIOUS ELECTIONS HAVE PROVEN TO BE VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COURT, CARLOS PALENQUE, 45, A RADIO AND TELEVISION BUSINESSMAN AND THE LEADER OF THE CONSCIENCE OF THE FATHERLAND , HAS RECEIVED MOST OF THE VOTES. PALENQUE RECEIVED 39.9 PERCENT OF THE VOTES CAST IN LA PAZ, THEREBY GIVING CONDEPA 5 OF THE 13 SEATS ON THE TOWN COUNCIL, WHICH WILL ELECT THE MAYOR OF LA PAZ ON 2 JANUARY. THE ALLIANCE OF THE RIGHT WING NATIONALIST DEMOCRATIC ACTION AND THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY LEFT HAS ALSO WON FIVE TOWN COUNCIL SEATS. RONALD MACLEAN, 40 AND OF SCOTTISH ANCESTRY, THE MAYORAL CANDIDATE OF THE ADN-MIR ALLIANCE, HAS OBTAINED 36.8 PERCENT OF THE VOTES IN LA PAZ, WHERE HE HAS BEEN THE MAYOR SINCE L985. FAR BEHIND WERE THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION'S PARTY, THE NATIONALIST REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT , WHICH RECEIVED TWO SEATS, AND THE POPULIST SOLIDARITY CIVIC UNION , LED BY BREWERY OWNER MAX FERNANDEZ, WITH ONE TOWN COUNCIL SEAT. THE DECISION AS TO WHO WILL BE THE NEW LA PAZ MAYOR ON 2 JANUARY IS NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE MNR, BUT ITS LEADERS DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THEIR POSITION LAST NIGHT. GONZALO SANCHEZ DE LOSADA, THE LEADER OF THE MNR, LAST NIGHT SAID ON TELEVISION: "WE MUST BE EXTREMELY SERIOUS IN SEARCHING FOR A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM, OR THE PEOPLE WILL TURN THEIR BACKS ON POPULISM." HE SAID HIS DECISION WILL BE "A CHRISTMAS PRESENT." HE INSISTED, HOWEVER, THAT IN HIS OPINION THE GOVERNING ADN-MIR ALLIANCE "WILL EASILY FIX THINGS BETWEEN THEM" BECAUSE "THEY ARE TWO OF A KIND." ALTHOUGH THE MNR WAS THE PARTY TO RECEIVE MOST OF THE VOTES IN THE 7 MAY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, IT WAS DUE TO AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN TWO OLD POLITICAL ENEMIES -- THE ADN AND MIR -- THAT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA, WHO HAD COME THIRD IN THE ELECTIONS, WAS INSTALLED AS PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC. "IF WE APPLIED THIS SAME RULE TO THE CURRENT PROBLEM," SANCHEZ DE LOSADA SAID JOKINGLY, "GUIDO CAPRA WOULD BE ELECTED." SANCHEZ DE LOSADA POINTED OUT THAT PALENQUE WAS ONE OF THE SUPPORTERS OF THE ADN-MIR GOVERNING ALLIANCE, WHICH PREVENTED SANCHEZ DE LOSADA FROM BECOMING PRESIDENT. ACCORDING TO THE OPPOSITION, PALENQUE'S PARTY GAINED THE LA PAZ DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION AND "HALF A MINISTRY" AS A RESULT OF THE ALLIANCE. SANCHEZ DE LOSADA WARNED THE BOLIVIAN POLITICIANS THAT PALENQUE'S POPULIST GROUP, WHICH IS GROWING VERY FAST, HAS ITS EYES SET "ON THE L993 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, NOT ONLY ON THE LA PAZ MAYORSHIP." WHILE RESPECT WAS SHOWN TOWARD RONALD MACLEAN, THE CANDIDATE MOST CRITICIZED BY THE MNR DURING THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS CAMPAIGN WAS PALENQUE. PALENQUE STATED, HOWEVER, THAT THE COUNCILMEN WHO ON 2 JANUARY WILL ELECT THE NEXT MAYOR OF LA PAZ MUST "RESPECT THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY." "WE HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE NO NEGOTIATION AND THAT THE DESIRE OF THE MAJORITY WILL BE RESPECTED," PALENQUE STATED. HE IS WELL KNOWN, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE BEARD HE WEARS, WHICH MAKES HIM LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT ABRAHAM LINCOLN. PALENQUE, WHO IS CERTAIN OF THE SUPPORT HE WILL RECEIVE FROM THE ONLY UCS COUNCILMAN IN LA PAZ, FEARS THAT A PACT BETWEEN THE ADN-MIR COALITION AND THE MNR WILL PREVENT HIM FROM OBTAINING THE MAYORSHIP OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CITY IN THE COUNTRY. SUCH AN ALLIANCE, HOWEVER, WITH A GREATER IDEOLOGICAL BASIS THAN ANY OTHER, WILL HAVE TO OVERCOME THE GRUDGE THAT THE MNR BEARS BECAUSE THE ADN AND THE MIR "HAD STOLEN FROM IT" THE PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC DURING THE LAST ELECTIONS, ACCORDING TO COMMENTATORS. "WE ARE GOING TO BE VERY RESPONSIBLE, AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE MOTIVATED BY PERSONAL INTERESTS OR BY ANY VENGEANCE," SANCHEZ DE LOSADA STATED, COMMENTING ON THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT WILL TAKE PLACE TO DESIGNATE THE MAYOR OF LA PAZ. LIKE IN LA PAZ, THE GOVERNMENT ALLIANCE WILL HAVE TO NEGOTIATE SUPPORT IN THE OTHER MAJOR BOLIVIAN CITIES, WHERE THE COALITION CAME IN FIRST BUT FAILED TO WIN ABSOLUTE MAJORITIES. THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS SUCRE, WHERE THE CANDIDATE OF THE UNITED LEFT COALITION, RADIO REPORTER OMAR MONTALVO, OBTAINED 57.3 PERCENT OF THE VOTES, WHICH IS SUFFICIENT TO OBTAIN THE MAYORSHIP. THE MOST OUTSTANDING POINTS ABOUT THE ELECTIONS WERE THE ABSTENTION OF BETWEEN 30 AND 50 PERCENT OF THE VOTERS AND THE ALMOST ABSOLUTE NORMALCY DURING THE ELECTIONS. THE STATE OF SIEGE DECREED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY ON 15 NOVEMBER DUE TO STREET CONFRONTATIONS CAUSED BY SOCIAL DISTURBANCES DID NOT HAMPER THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. THE TRADITIONAL RESTRICTIONS, HOWEVER, AFFECTED TRAFFIC AND HAMPERED PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, KEEPING VOTERS FROM CASTING THEIR VOTES. THE ABSTENTION WAS ALSO CAUSED BY THE WEARINESS OF THE VOTERS, WHO ARE VOTING FOR THE FOURTH TIME IN 4 YEARS.
DEV-MUC3-0927	LIMA, 28 NOV 89 -- DELEGATES TO A LATIN AMERICAN CONGRESS THAT IS BEING HELD IN LIMA ON MISSING DETAINEES IN LATIN AMERICA TODAY EXPRESSED THEIR "CONCERN" THAT THE LARGEST NUMBER OF DETAINEES AND MISSING PEOPLE ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS. "WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE GROUPS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DISAPPEARANCES. THESE GROUPS ARE ORGANIZED BY THE STATE ITSELF TO GET RID OF ITS POLITICAL OPPONENTS AND THESE GROUPS ARE EQUIPPED WITH ALL THE RESOURCES REQUIRED TO ENGAGE IN ACTS OF IMPUNITY," SAID THE CONGRESS SPOKESPERSON. ABOUT 200 DELEGATES FROM 12 LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND FROM EUROPEAN AND U.S. HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE IX CONGRESS OF THE LATIN AMERICAN FEDERATION OF ASSOCIATIONS OF RELATIVES OF MISSING DETAINEES THAT BEGAN TODAY AND WILL END ON 30 NOVEMBER IN LIMA. SOLA SIERRA, A MEMBER OF THE FEDERATION, HAS TOLD EFE THAT "THE ON THE ESCALATION OF THESE PRACTICES, AND ON THE IMPUNITY PREVAILING IN ALL COUNTRIES WHERE THIS METHOD OF REPRESSION PREVAILS." SIERRA, A CHILEAN CITIZEN, SAID THAT THIS YEAR THE COUNTRIES WITH THE LARGEST NUMBER OF MISSING DETAINEES ARE COLOMBIA, EL SALVADOR, GUATEMALA, AND PERU, "WHERE POLITICAL VIOLENCE HAS INCREASED." HOWEVER, SHE FAILED TO MENTION THE NUMBER OF MISSING DETAINEES. SIERRA, THE CHILEAN DELEGATE AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE CHILEAN ASSOCIATION OF RELATIVES OF MISSING PEOPLE, SAID THAT THERE IS NO TOTAL NUMBER OF MISSING PEOPLE, BUT THAT MORE THAN 100,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN REPORTED MISSING THROUGHOUT LATIN AMERICA SINCE 1981. "THIS FIGURE HAS INCREASED AT A FRIGHTENING RATE, AND WE REGRET THAT THE LARGEST NUMBERS OF CASES HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN COUNTRIES WITH DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS," SHE ADDED. SHE SAID THAT "NEITHER UNDER A DICTATORSHIP NOR UNDER A DEMOCRACY" HAS THE PROBLEM OF THE MISSING DETAINEES BEEN RESOLVED BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT "ALWAYS MANAGE TO TALK ITS WAY OUT OF INVESTIGATING OR PUNISHING. " ARGUE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO FORGET THE PAST IN ORDER TO BUILD THE PRESENT AND THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO RECONCILE IF PEACE IS TO PREVAIL. BUT HOW CAN THERE BE PEACE AND RECONCILIATION WHILE EXTREMELY SERIOUS EVENTS LIKE THE MASSIVE KILLING OF HUMAN BEINGS CONTINUE," SHE ADDED. SIERRA REGRETTED THAT "THERE IS VERY STRONG PRESS CENSORSHIP, AND, WHAT IS WORSE, A SELF-IMPOSED CENSORSHIP " IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE MOST MISSING DETAINEES HAVE BEEN REPORTED. THESE SITUATIONS ALWAYS LEAD US TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS THE STATE THAT PROMOTES THIS ENTIRE POLICY, THAT IS TO SAY, THE USE OF STATE TERRORISM IN COUNTRIES WHERE A STATE OF LAW, COURTS, AND ESTABLISHED LEGAL PRACTICES PREVAIL, SIERRA COMMENTED. IN TODAY'S SESSION, A MEMBER OF THE PERUVIAN DELEGATION SAID THAT OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS AT LEAST 4,000 PEOPLE, MOSTLY PEASANTS AND ANDEAN COMMUNITY LEADERS, WHO WERE "ARRESTED BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO LATER DENIED IT," HAVE DISAPPEARED. THE MEMBER OF THE PERUVIAN DELEGATION SAID THAT, ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL FIGURES, ABOUT 15,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED AS A RESULT OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN PERU, AND THAT A "NEGLIGIBLE NUMBER" HAS BEEN KILLED IN CLASHES.
DEV-MUC3-0928	SAN SALVADOR, 4 DEC 89 -- THE GUERRILLA ATTACK LAUNCHED ON 11 NOVEMBER HAS INFLICTED 4,834 CASUALTIES ON THE SALVADORAN TROOPS AND GUERRILLAS, ACCORDING TO A REPORT ISSUED TODAY BY THE GOVERNMENT ARMED FORCES. THE REPORT NOTES THAT, IN THE LAST 24 DAYS, 1,853 FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GUERRILLAS AND 457 SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN KILLED, WHILE 1,183 REBELS AND 1,341 SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN WOUNDED. OVER THE SAME PERIOD, THE MILITARY REPORT ADDS, THE ARMY SEIZED 900 RIFLES OF VARIOUS TYPES AND CALIBERS, INCLUDING 300 AK-47'S AND DRAGONOVS, 140 GRENADE LAUNCHERS, AND ABUNDANT MATERIAL TO MAKE EXPLOSIVES. MILITARY SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT FMLN GROUPS CLASHED WITH ARMY TROOPS NEAR ZACATECOLUCA, A DEPARTMENT CAPITAL LOCATED 54 KM SOUTH OF SAN SALVADOR. THEY SAID THAT THE CLASHES LASTED SEVERAL HOURS AND THAT THE AIR FORCE MOVED IN TO ROUT OUT THE GUERRILLAS. MEANWHILE, THE FMLN CLAIMED CREDIT THROUGH ITS CLANDESTINE RADIO FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF AN ARMORED VEHICLE IN EL PUENTE JURISDICTION OF SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. HOWEVER, THIS REPORT HAS NOT BEEN CONFIRMED BY THE GOVERNMENT.
DEV-MUC3-0929	SAN SALVADOR, 4 DEC 89 -- SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI TONIGHT CONFIRMED THAT HE WILL ATTEND THE SPECIAL SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS IN COSTA RICA ON 10-11 DECEMBER. CRISTIANI SAID OVER RADIO AND TELEVISION THAT HE WILL ATTEND THE SUMMIT "IN DEFENSE OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE" AND TO TELL NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA THAT "UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS HIS SENDING THE FMLN PUPPETS TO KILL SALVADORANS JUSTIFIED." CRISTIANI SAID TODAY THAT EL SALVADOR "HAS ALWAYS BEEN WILLING TO FIND A SOLUTION THROUGH PEACEFUL MEANS" BUT IN ALLUSION TO NICARAGUA, HE ADDED THAT "THOSE WHO SEEK TO SIGN COMMITMENTS WITH THE REST OF THE PRESIDENTS SHOULD ALSO FULFILL THEM." MEANWHILE, HONDURAN PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA SAID TODAY IN TEGUCIGALPA THAT HE WAS WILLING TO ATTEND THE SUMMIT. HOWEVER, COSTA RICAN FOREIGN MINISTER RODRIGO MADRIGAL SAID IN HIS COUNTRY THAT EL SALVADOR AND HONDURAS HAD NOT OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED THEIR ATTENDANCE. ACCORDING TO CRISTIANI, HE WILL CONFIRM HIS ATTENDANCE ON 5 DECEMBER. MADRIGAL PREDICTED THAT THE SUMMIT "WILL NOT BE EASY" DUE TO THE TOPICS THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED AND BECAUSE THE AGENDA WILL SURELY INCLUDE THE ALLEGED NICARAGUAN ASSISTANCE TO THE FMLN AND THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE CONTRAS AS REQUESTED BY NICARAGUA. HOWEVER, THE AGENDA IS BEING PROCESSED AND ALTHOUGH COSTA RICA OFFERED TO HOST THE MEETING, "IT IS NOT INTERESTED IN FORCING THE ISSUE," HE EMPHASIZED. MADRIGAL ADDED THAT WHAT INTERESTS COSTA RICA IS TO SERVE AS A "BRIDGE" FOR SOLVING THE CONFLICT BETWEEN NICARAGUA AND EL SALVADOR, AND FINDING SOME FORMULA SO THAT THE SALVADORAN AND NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENTS WILL ESTABLISH A DIALOGUE WITH THE REBELS. HE ADDED THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF THE FIVE COUNTRIES WILL MEET IN SAN JOSE ON THE EVE OF THE LONG-AWAITED MEETING TO PREPARE FOR IT. THE COSTA RICAN FOREIGN MINISTER REPORTED THAT THEY ARE ALSO CONSIDERING THE POSSIBILITY OF INVITING FOREIGN MINISTERS FROM OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UN OBSERVER GROUP IN CENTRAL AMERICA .
DEV-MUC3-0930	SAN SALVADOR, 5 DEC 89 -- VIOLENT CLASHES BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA FORCES AND THE ARMY TODAY AGAIN SHOOK THE NORTHWEST SECTOR OF SAN SALVADOR, AFTER A FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT COLUMN RAIDED THE TOWN OF SAN ANTONIO ABAD. AT LEAST FIVE MILITARY AND REBEL DEATHS, THREE STORES PARTIALLY DESTROYED, AND ONE ELECTRIC POLE BLOWN UP ARE THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF THE CLASHES IN SAN ANTONIO ABAD, BETWEEN 2100 ON 4 DECEMBER AND 0200 5 DECEMBER. THE FMLN GUERRILLA FORCES TODAY ALSO ATTACKED ARMY POSITIONS IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE, A WORKERS' NEIGHBORHOOD NORTH OF THE CAPITAL, AND LA CIMA NEIGHBORHOOD, SOUTHEAST OF THE CAPITAL, WHERE THE CLASHES WERE STILL UNDERWAY AT MID-MORNING. THE ARMY ADMITTED THAT ONE SOLDIER DIED AND FIVE WERE WOUNDED DURING THE CLASHES IN SAN ANTONIO ABAD, A MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD LOCATED BESIDE THE ESCALON RESIDENTIAL AREA; AND AT LEAST FOUR REBELS WERE RIPPED TO PIECES BY A LAW ROUND. LOTS OF BLOOD AND PIECES OF FLESH STUCK TO BACKPACKS AND MILITARY UNIFORM FRAGMENTS WERE SCATTERED IN A-30 METER AREA WITHIN AN EMPTY LOT IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA OF THE TOWN. AN OFFICER OF THE NATIONAL POLICE'S ELITE PANTERA BATTALION, WHICH PARTICIPATED IN THE FIGHTING, TOLD AFP: "THE ROUND FELL EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE. AT LEAST FOUR DIED ON THE SPOT AND MANY WERE WOUNDED." THE REBELS BLEW UP A GROCERY STORE AND AN ELECTRIC POLE IN DOWNTOWN SAN ANTONIO ABAD; AND ONE DRUGSTORE AND OTHER STORES ALSO SUSTAINED CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE DURING THE FIGHTING. TENSION AND NERVOUSNESS PREVAILED THIS MORNING IN SAN ANTONIO ABAD, WHERE MANY PERSONS WERE LOOKING FOR EXPLOSIVES AND TNT LEFT BEHIND BY THE REBELS. ARMY SPOKESMEN HAVE YET TO ISSUE A REPORT ON THE FIGHTING AT LA CIMA AND AYUTUXTEPEQUE, BUT THE PEOPLE OF AYUTUXTEPEQUE SAID THERE WAS FIERCE FIGHTING IN THE SECTOR, ADDING THAT THE REBELS ENTRENCHED THEMSELVES INSIDE THE LOCAL CHURCH TO FIRE AT THE GOVERNMENT'S TROOPS. MEANWHILE, REPORTS FROM THE INTERIOR INDICATE THAT THE FIGHTING DIMINISHED TODAY IN THE REGION OF ZACATECOLUCA, USULUTAN, AND SAN MIGUEL, WHERE THE MILITARY SITUATION WAS EXTRAORDINARILY TENSE UNTIL THE NIGHT OF 4 DECEMBER. NEVERTHELESS, THE GOVERNMENT TODAY EXPLAINED THAT THE REDUCTION IN CURFEW HOURS, FROM 2100 TO 0500 EFFECTIVE LAST NIGHT, DOES NOT APPLY FOR THE CITY OF ZACATECOLUCA, CAPITAL OF LA PAZ DEPARTMENT -- LOCATED IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY -- WHICH THE GUERRILLA FORCES HAVE BEEN CONSTANTLY HARASSING THROUGHOUT THE WEEK. MEANWHILE, THE FMLN WARNED THE OWNERS OF COMMERCIAL AND CROP DUSTING AIRPLANES TO ABSTAIN FROM USING THEIR PLANMES FOR THE ARMY TO CONDUCTRE RECONAISSANCE FLIGHTS IN THE REGION OF ZACATECOLUCA AND USULUTAN, "BECAUSE THEY WILL BE CONSIDERED MILITARY TARGETS."
DEV-MUC3-0931	VATICAN CITY , 5 DEC 89 -- IN AN INTERVIEW PUBLISHED IN THE RELIGIOUS MONTHLY MAGAZINE "30 GIORNI" , SAN SALVADOR ARCHBISHOP ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS HAS ONCE AGAIN BLAMED THE SALVADORAN ARMY FOR THE MURDER OF SIX JESUITS FROM THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY . RIVERA Y DAMAS SAID THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS WHY "ONLY THE MILITARY COULD BE AT THE SITE." THE ARCHBISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR UNDERLINED THAT THE SITE OF THE INCIDENT "IS AN AREA HIGHLY CONTROLLED BY THE MILITARY," THAT ON THE DAY IN QUESTION "THE CURFEW OR, IN OTHER WORDS, MARTIAL LAW WAS IN EFFECT," AND THAT "THERE IS A MILITARY NEIGHBORHOOD NEAR THE UCA." "ALL OF THIS LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE GUERRILLAS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE. THE OPERATION LASTED 1/2 HOUR AND THE UNIFORMED INDIVIDUALS STAYED THERE FOR A GOOD WHILE, 2 OR PERHAPS 3 HOURS. HAD THEY BEEN GUERRILLAS, THEY WOULD HAVE ATTACKED AND FLED IMMEDIATELY," HE ADDED. ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS ALSO UNDERSCORED THAT "THEY TOOK THE PRIESTS OUT TO THE GARDEN, MURDERED THEM, EXPLODED DEVICES, BURNED THE HOUSE, AND STAYED AT THE SITE FOR A LONG TIME," WHICH "MEANS THAT THEY FELT SURE OF THEMSELVES." THE ARCHBISHOP SAID DURING THE INTERVIEW THAT "IT HAS BEEN FULLY PROVEN" THAT THERE ARE TWO POLITICAL LINES WITHIN THE RULING ARENA PARTY: "ONE HEADED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI, AND ANOTHER MORE RADICAL SECTOR." RIVERA Y DAMAS SAID THAT HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE GUERRILLAS HAVE BEEN "ELIMINATED" BY THE ARMY. " THEY HAVE NOT ACCOMPLISHED WHAT THEY WANTED, BUT, HE SAID, THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ELIMINATED, AND THAT IS WHY I STILL BELIEVE THAT THE BEST COURSE IS THAT OF NEGOTIATION." REGARDING THE LETTER SENT TO THE POPE BY EL SALVADOR'S ATTORNEY GENERAL, IN WHICH HE ADVISES THE DEPARTURE OF A FEW BISHOPS FROM EL SALVADOR, RIVERA Y DAMAS COMMENTED THAT IN A WAY IT WAS BENEFICIAL BECAUSE "WE HAVE NEVER RECEIVED AS MUCH SOLIDARITY OR SUPPORT AS WE ARE RECEIVING NOW FROM THE SUPREME PONTIFF TO THE EPISCOPAL CONFERENCES." RIVERA Y DAMAS ALSO POINTED OUT THAT HE HAS BEEN THREATENED, NOT ONLY BY PHONE BUT BY RADIO.
DEV-MUC3-0932	BOGOTA, 5 DEC 89 -- COLOMBIAN JUDGE BERNARDO JARAMILLO URIBE WAS ASSASSINATED AT NOON TODAY IN MEDELLIN, LOCATED 500 KM NORTHWEST OF BOGOTA, IT WAS REPORTED TODAY BY THE NATIONAL POLICE. THIS IS THE FOURTH JUDGE RIDDLED WITH BULLETS BY UNIDENTIFIED GUNMEN -- APPARENTLY PAID ASSASSINS AT THE SERVICE OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKING MAFIAS -- IN MEDELLIN WITHIN 5 MONTHS. JUDGE MARIA HELENA DIAZ WAS ASSASSINATED ON 28 JULY; MEDELLIN HIGHER COURT MAGISTRATE HECTOR JIMENEZ WAS KILLED ON 17 OCTOBER; AND MAGISTRATE MARIELA ESPINOZA WAS KILLED ON 1 NOVEMBER. JARAMILLO URIBE WORKED AS JUDGE OF THE 13TH CRIMINAL COURT IN MEDELLIN, THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE MEDELLIN DRUG CARTEL. A POLICE REPORT INDICATES THAT JARAMILLO URIBE WAS SHOT AT FROM TWO AUTOMOBILES IN THE WESTERN SECTOR OF ANTIOQUIA PROVINCE'S CAPITAL, WHEN HE WAS LEAVING HIS OFFICE. THE CRIMES HAVE LED TO PROTESTS AND STRIKES BY COLOMBIAN JUDGES AND JUDICIAL BRANCH OFFICIALS, WHO HAVE DEMANDED BETTER PROTECTION FROM PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S LIBERAL PARTY GOVERNMENT. JUDGE JARAMILLO URIBE WAS INVESTIGATING THE MASSACRE OF 43 PERSONS IN THE TOWN OF SEGOVIA BY A PARAMILITARY GROUP; AND THE MURDER OF COLONEL WALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO, COMMANDER OF THE ANTIOQUIA POLICE.
DEV-MUC3-0933	CLANDESTINE, 5 DEC 89 -- THE PEOPLE'S ANTI-AIRCRAFT POWER HAS BEGUN TO BECOME EFFECTIVE. SALVADORANS, THIS AFTERNOON WE DOWNED AN O-2 AIRPLANE IN THE AREA OF THE CITY OF USULUTAN. RADIO VENCEREMOS REPORTS THAT THE ANTI-AIRCRAFT FIRE OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT DOWNED A PUSH-PULL AIRPLANE THIS AFTERNOON. AT 1615, THE FMLN'S ANTI-AIRCRAFT FIRE DOWNED A PUSH-PULL AIRPLANE OVER THE CITY OF USULUTAN. LATER IN THIS PROGRAM WE WILL PROVIDE DETAILS OF THE DOWNING OF THE PUSH-PULL AIRPLANE DOWNED IN THE CITY OF USULUTAN. ITS CREW DIED WHEN THE PLANE CRASHED. IT IS A PLANE THAT CRASHED JUST AS THE REGIME OF 50 YEARS OF INJUSTICE IS CRASHING. WE HAVE DOWNED ONE OF THE PLANES THAT HAD BEEN BOMBING THE ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD. WE HAVE DOWNED A PLANE PILOTED BY THOSE WHO HAD BEEN BRINGING DEATH AND DESTRUCTION TO MEJICANOS, SOYAPANGO, AND SAN MIGUEL. WITH THE DOWNING OF THIS PLANE, OUR PEOPLE AVENGE THE BLOOD SPILLED BY THE GENOCIDE. THIS SHOWS THAT THE FMLN'S ANTI-AIRCRAFT FIRE HAS BEGUN TO BECOME EFFECTIVE.
DEV-MUC3-0934	LA PAZ, 27 NOV 89 -- CHIMORE, COCHABAMBA, 26 NOV -- THE SPECIAL ANTINARCOTICS FORCE, HEADQUARTERED IN THE CHAPARE REGION, IS CONFISCATING A MONTHLY AVERAGE OF 500 KG OF COCAINE AS A RESULT OF "STRICT CONTROLS AND THE SUCCESS OF ITS AGENTS." COLONEL MARIO VELASCO, COMMANDER OF THE MOBILE UNITS FOR RURAL AREAS , HAS SAID THAT, DESPITE EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL LIMITATIONS, "OUR EFFORTS ARE STRONG AND RESOLVED" AND THEY HAVE ALLOWED US TO DEAL "HARSH BLOWS TO DRUG TRAFFICKING." REGARDING THE PRESENCE OF COLOMBIAN "DRUG TRAFFICKERS" IN THIS AREA, COL VELASCO SAID THAT THERE IS INFORMATION ON THEIR PRESENCE, BUT "WE HAVE NOT ACTUALLY HAD ANY CONTACTS WITH THEM OR DETAINED ANY OF THEM." COL VELASCO POINTED OUT THAT INVESTIGATIONS BASED ON INTELLIGENCE DATA ARE UNDER WAY. THESE INVESTIGATIONS WILL ALLOW US TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THEM AND, IF POSSIBLE, MAKE SOME ARRESTS, HE SAID. COL VELASCO SAID: "ANYBODY WHO DOES NOT HAVE LEGAL DOCUMENTS, ESPECIALLY FOREIGNERS, IS BEING INVESTIGATED. WE ARE MAINTAINING STRICT CONTROL AT OUR CHECKPOINTS. WE DO INDEED HAVE INFORMATION , BUT, I REPEAT, WE HAVE NOT HAD ANY TYPE OF CONTACT WITH THEM."
DEV-MUC3-0935	TEGUCIGALPA, 5 DEC 89 -- GUATEMALA, WHERE ARMED GROUPS HAVE CONTINUED TO RUN RAMPANT, HAS BEEN THE VICTIM OF THIS INTERCONTINENTAL INTEREST. NICARAGUA HAS BEEN TAKEN OVER BY THE SANDINIST FORCES, WHICH RECEIVE ARMS OF ALL KINDS. MORE ARMS THAN FOOD, MORE INSTRUCTORS THAN AGRICULTURAL EXPERTS, AND MORE ARMS THAN FINANCE ASSISTANCE FOR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT KEEP REACHING NICARAGUA. NICARAGUA HAS BECOME A DISTRIBUTION CENTER FOR OTHER COUNTRIES WHO RAISE PIRATE FLAGS, COUNTRIES WHOSE LEADERS KNOW THAT THE SOVIET UNION IS INTERESTED IN THE FIVE COUNTRIES OF THE ISTHMUS. THIS IS WHY THE SOVIET UNION CONTINUALLY AIDS THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS. THE INTERRUPTION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND ARMS WOULD ENTAIL FAILURE OF THE STRUGGLE FOR POWER IN CENTRAL AMERICA. OVER THE COURSE OF THE TALKS ABOARD SOVIET AND U.S. SHIPS OFF MALTA, BUSH'S POSITION REMAINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERESTS OF BOTH THE U.S. AND OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES. MANY OF THESE LATTER COUNTRIES ARE THREATENED BY RADICAL AND CLANDESTINE MOVEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE U.S. PRESIDENT HAS JUST TAKEN FIRM STEPS TOWARD A DIRECT UNDERSTANDING WITH THE SOVIET UNION. THIS MEANS THAT THE GUERRILLAS MOVEMENTS IN SEVERAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES WILL HAVE TO CONSENT TO CIVILIZED DIALOGUE SO THEY CAN COEXIST WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION, WHO DESIRE TO LIVE IN PEACE, WITH WORK AND DIGNITY. EL SALVADOR REPRESENTS THE MOST DANGEROUS EXAMPLE OF THIS INTERCONTINENTAL PENETRATION. IN THIS COUNTRY OPERATES A GUERRILLA MOVEMENT HEAVILY SUPPLIED WITH ARMS AND AMMUNITION. THESE REBELS ARE MILITARILY AND OTHERWISE TRAINED FOR CLANDESTINE OPERATIONS THAT SOW TERROR IN THE THREATENED TOWNS AND VILLAGES. THE SOVIET UNION SUPPLIES THESE ARMS THROUGH CUBA. SALVADORAN PRESIDENT CRISTIANI EXPECTS THE ACCORDS REACHED BY THE TWO WORLD LEADERS TO CUT THE SUPPLY OF WAR MATERIEL TO THE FMLN. THIS MATERIEL HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO KILL THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS. WE WILL HAVE WAITED FOR THE PASSAGE OF TIME TO SEE IF IT IS TRUE THAT THE SUPPLY OF ARMS HAS CEASED AND THAT NICARAGUA HAS STOPPED ASSISTING THE FMLN. WE ONLY HOPE THE FMLN WILL NOT COME TO HONDURAS. THE CABINETS THAT DRAFT WAR PLANS ARE NOW CURRENTLY DISCUSSING THE FMLN'S MOVING INTO HONDURAS.
DEV-MUC3-0936	BOGOTA, 6 DEC 89 -- JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO TWO VERY STRONG EXPLOSIONS OCCURRED IN THE CENTER OF BOGOTA. WE FELT THESE EXPLOSIONS HERE AT THE RCN BUILDING. ONE OF THE EXPLOSIONS OCCURRED IN THE VICINITY OF THE COURTS IN THE PALO QUEMADO SECTOR, WHERE ALL THE BOGOTA JUDICIAL BRANCH OFFICES ARE LOCATED. APPARENTLY THE OTHER EXPLOSION OCCURRED IN A STREET NEAR THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE. THERE WERE TWO EXPLOSIONS OCCURRING CONSECUTIVELY BUT VERY CLOSE TOGETHER, WHICH IS WHY IT WAS FELT SO STRONGLY. IT INITIALLY FELT LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE: FIRST THE WAVE AND THEN THE EXPLOSION. ALL THE RESIDENTS IN THIS CENTRAL AREA OF BOGOTA FELT IT. IT IS ALSO SAID THAT THE EXPLOSION COULD HAVE OCCURRED CLOSER TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY, DAS, WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE SAME AREA. THE DAS HEADQUARTERS ARE JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM THE JUDICIAL BRANCH OFFICES IN PALO QUEMADO. THE STRONG EXPLOSION THAT WAS FELT BY ALL OF US WHO WORK AT THIS HOUR IN THE CENTRAL BOGOTA AREA TOOK PLACE AT 19TH CARRERA AND 25TH STREET IN PALO QUEMADO. I REPEAT, TWO CONSECUTIVE EXPLOSIONS OCCURRED AT 0735 IN THE CENTER OF BOGOTA. HERE IS SOME UPDATED INFORMATION: IT WAS NOT TWO EXPLOSIONS, AS WE HAD INTIALLY BELIEVED, BUT THREE EXPLOSIONS THAT OCCURRED A FEW MINUTES AGO IN BOGOTA. ONE OF THEM WAS IN THE PALO QUEMADO SECTOR, AS WE HAVE ALREADY REPORTED, IN THE AREA WHERE BOTH THE BOGOTA COURTS AND DAS ARE LOCATED. ANOTHER EXPLOSION OCCURRED IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF BOGOTA AT 14TH CARRERA AND 28TH STREET SOUTH, APPARENTLY NEAR AN AGRARIAN TRUST BRANCH IN THE BARRIO GUSTAVO RESTREPO NEIGHBORHOOD. A THIRD EXPLOSION OCCURRED IN THE CENTRAL AREA OF BOGOTA. THESE THREE EXPLOSIONS IN BOGOTA TOOK PLACE ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY, JUST A FEW SECONDS APART. WE NOW HAVE OFFICIAL FIGURES OF THE EXPLOSION NEAR THE DAS HEADQUARTERS: SEVEN PERSONS WERE KILLED, MORE THAN 50 WERE WOUNDED, AND APPROXIMATELY 25 VEHICLES AND AT LEAST 15 BUILDINGS -- INCLUDING THE DAS OFFICES THAT WERE PARTIALLY DESTROYED -- WERE DAMAGED. INITIALLY, DAS OFFICIALS HAVE ESTIMATED THAT A POWERFUL BOMB OF MORE THAN 100 KG OF DYNAMITE PLACED IN A TRUCK WAS ACTIVATED. THE HUGE EXPLOSION CAUSED THE INITIAL DESTRUCTION OF THE FRONT PART OF THE DAS HEADQUARTERS, AS WELL AS A BUILDING WHERE THERE WAS A HARDWARE STORE, AND THE TOTAL DESTRUCTION OF SIX OR SEVEN OTHER BUILDINGS. A CRATER 15 METERS WIDE AND 6 METERS DEEP WAS CREATED IN 27TH CARRERA. MOST OF THE VICTIMS OF THE EXPLOSION WERE IN PRIVATE VEHICLES AND TAXIS, AND ONLY FOUR WERE WALKING IN THE AREA WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED AT ALMOST 0740. OFFICIALS SAY INITIALLY THAT THERE WERE 50 PERSONS, HIT BY GLASS SHARDS AND FLYING PIECES OF VEHICLES, INJURED IN THE EXPLOSION. OFFICIALS HAVE INDICATED THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS WILL INCREASE, AS THE ATTACK AGAINST THE DAS HEADQUARTERS WAS VERY STRONG. WE REPEAT: OFFICIALLY, SEVEN PERSONS WERE KILLED HERE IN FRONT OF THE DAS HEADQUARTERS.
DEV-MUC3-0937	SANTIAGO, 5 DEC 89 -- ADMIRAL JOSE TORIBIO MERINO CASTRO TODAY STATED THAT THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT JUNTA HAS DECIDED TO MEET TWICE A WEEK, TUESDAYS AND THURSDAYS, IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE THE HANDLING OF DRAFT LAWS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSIDERATION. ASKED ABOUT THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN CHILE, MERINO SAID THAT EVERYTHING IS CALM. THE POLITICAL SITUATION IS CALM, EXCEPT FOR THE LEFTISTS, THAT IS, NOT THE LEFTISTS IN GENERAL BUT THOSE WHO LIKE THROWING BOMBS AND KILLING PEOPLE. THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE MARRING AN EXTRAORDINARILY PERFECT DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. THIS SITUATION IS UNIQUE IN THE WORLD, BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT ALL THOSE WHO CAN VOTE HAVE BEEN REGISTERED, AT LEAST 99 PERCENT OF THEM. ADM MERINO ADDED THAT THE PREVAILING CALM MUST CONTINUE UNDER THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION. THE PEACEFUL ATMOSPHERE MUST CONTINUE IF WE ARE TO LIVE IN A DEMOCRACY RESPECTFUL OF THE PEOPLE AND THEIR RIGHTS. WHAT I MEAN IS THAT AS LONG AS THERE IS RESPECT, THERE WILL BE TRANQUILLITY. ADM MERINO STATED THAT THE NEW CENTRAL BANK EXECUTIVE BOARD WILL ENSURE GREATER STABILITY, ESPECIALLY IN THE EXCHANGE RATE FOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES. ASKED ABOUT FIDEL CASTRO'S RECENT OFFER TO MEDIATE BETWEEN CHILE AND BOLIVIA, MERINO SAID THAT THE CUBAN DICTATOR HAS NO BUSINESS MEDDLING IN CHILE. FIDEL CASTRO. THIS SCARECROW WOULD DO BETTER TO KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT BECAUSE HE HAS NO BUSINESS MEDDLING IN CHILE. A CLEAR IDEA OF PERESTROYKA AND THE OTHER LESSONS THAT GORBACHEV IS TEACHING . HE IS PROBABLY THINKING THAT BOLIVIA IS ABOUT TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE COMMUNISTS BECAUSE THOSE IN THE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE LEANING TO THE LEFT, AND THAT CHILE WILL FOLLOW SUIT. SO HE FIGURES THAT HE, AS A LEFTIST, WILL HAVE THE CHANCE TO MEDDLE IN CHILEAN AFFAIRS. NOT SO. NOBODY EXCEPT WE CHILEANS WILL HANDLE OUR AFFAIRS. THE BEST THING THIS CASTRO CAN DO IS STAY HOME. HE ALREADY VISITED CHILE; I MET HIM AND SO DID OTHERS. HE SPENT A WHOLE NIGHT TALKING TO IN PUNTA ARENAS WHEN I MET HIM. SO HE HAS NOTHING TO DO HERE. ADM MERINO CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT ON THE DAY OF THE ELECTION HE WILL STAY IN HIS OFFICE, JUST IN CASE.
DEV-MUC3-0938	BOGOTA, 6 DEC 89 -- COLOMBIA'S ACTING PRESIDENT CARLOS LEMOS HAS SAID THAT THE NARCOTERRORISTS WHO PERPETRATED AN ATTACK IN BOGOTA TODAY THAT LEFT 31 DEAD AND MORE THAN 1,000 INJURED "DESERVE NO MERCY FROM GOD." LEMOS ADMITTED THAT THE CAR BOMB ATTACK ON THE HEADQUARTERS OF COLOMBIA'S SECRET SECURITY POLICE IN BOGOTA "IS THE MOST SERIOUS AND THE BLOODIEST" ATTACK EVER COMMITTED IN THE COUNTRY. LEMOS, FILLING IN FOR PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO WHO IS ON AN OFFICIAL VISIT TO JAPAN, TOLD AFP THAT CONTROLLING THE TERRORISTS "IS VERY DIFFICULT" BECAUSE "THEY ENJOY THE ADVANTAGE OF SURPRISE." THE ACTING PRESIDENT POINTED OUT THAT "THE AUTHORITIES CANNOT GUARD EVERY METER OF THE CITY STREETS." LEMOS SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS STEPPED UP SECURITY THROUGHOUT THE CAPITAL, AND ADDED THAT A "HEAD-ON" STRUGGLE WILL BE WAGED AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKING MAFIAS THAT ARE OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY. "THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY FOR A TRUCE WITH DRUG TRAFFICKERS," THE ACTING MINISTER SAID. HE POINTED OUT THAT "THE SLAUGHTER," WHICH HE HAD WARNED ABOUT LAST WEEK BEFORE THE CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES, IS NOW UNDER WAY. LEMOS HAS OPPOSED THE INCLUSION OF THE EXTRADICTION TO THE UNITED STATES OF COLOMBIANS CHARGED WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING IN A REFERENDUM SCHEDULED FOR 21 JANUARY. LEMOS SEIZED THAT OPPORTUNITY TO URGE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO KEEP EXTRADICTION AS A TOOL TO PUNISH DRUG TRAFFICKERS. A GROUP OF PARLIAMENTARIANS HAVE INSISTED ON INTRODUCING THE EXTRADICTION ISSUE IN THE REFERENDUM. THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT THIS IS A PERNICIOUS ACTION, BECAUSE IT COULD INCREASE THE TERRORISM THAT IS SCORCHING THE COUNTRY. "THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT CANNOT BE DEPRIVED OF A TOOL SUCH AS EXTRADICTION," LEMOS CONCLUDED. LAST NIGHT THE CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES SURPRISINGLY APPROVED A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO INCLUDE THE EXTRADICTION ISSUE IN THE REFERENDUM.
DEV-MUC3-0939	LA PAZ, 27 NOV 89 -- ACCORDING TO A REPORT ISSUED BY THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS COMMISSION, DRUG TRAFFICKING IS ONE OF THE MAIN FACTORS IN BOLIVIA PREVENTING A SOCIAL EXPLOSION BECAUSE IT CONTRIBUTES 20 PERCENT OF THE JOB OPPORTUNITIES. "THE BOLIVIAN LABOR FORCE IS OFFICIALLY MADE UP OF 1.7 MILLION PEOPLE. THE DRUG BUSINESS PROVIDES ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE OR FOUR JOBS," THE REPORT STATES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT DATA OBTAINED FROM GOVERNMENT CIRCLES. IT ADDS THAT THE COCAINE "BOOM" IN BOLIVIA COINCIDED WITH THE TOUGH ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT HAS BEEN EXPERIENCED SINCE 1981 AND THAT THE "COCA-DOLLARS" HAVE CUSHIONED THE SOCIAL EXPLOSION. "LIKE ANY OTHER BUSINESS, COCAINE TRAFFICKING ACQUIRES SYSTEMS OF CAPITAL AND DISTRIBUTION. IT ALSO HAS FIXED EXPENDITURES. THESE "INVESTMENTS" INCLUDE RAW MATERIAL , CHEMICAL PRODUCTS AND LABORATORIES, CHEMISTS, TRANSPORTATION, SERVICES , AND SECURITY, WHICH INCLUDES PAYMENTS OF TIPS TO PUBLIC OFFICIALS, POLITICIANS, JUDGES, AND POLICEMEN. IN SOME COUNTRIES THE GUERRILLAS ARE PAID TO PROVIDE PROTECTION," THE COMMISSION'S REPORT STATES. THE COMMISSION REPORTS THAT SANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA HAS BECOME A PROSPEROUS TOWN PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE DRUG TRADE. "ONE OF THE CLEAREST EFFECTS RECORDED IN THE THREE COCAINE AREAS IS THAT IT PROVIDES JOB OPPORTUNITIES," THE REPORT STATES. IT ADDS THAT BETWEEN 750,000 AND 1.1 MILLION PEOPLE ARE DIRECTLY EMPLOYED IN THE DRUG BUSINESS IN BOLIVIA. IT STATES THAT COCA LEAF PRODUCTION IS WHAT PROVIDES MOST OF THE JOB OPPORTUNTIES IN THIS BUSINESS. ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, 500,000 PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED EXCLUSIVELY IN COCA LEAF PRODUCTION. THE NUMBER OF PRODUCERS IN THE CHAPARE REGION IS ESTIMATED AT 36,864, AND THEY ARE LINKED IN 6 FEDERATIONS, 54 ASSOCIATIONS , AND 610 UNIONS. IN THE YUNGAS ZONE OF LA PAZ, THE NUMBER OF PRODUCERS IS ESTIMATED AT 26,280, ORGANIZED INTO 4 FEDERATIONS, 14 ASSOCIATIONS, AND 650 COLONIES OR COMMUNITIES. THE COCA CROP IS ESTIMATED TO BE 45,100 HECTARES IN THE CHAPARE ZONE AND 19,695 HECTARES IN THE YUNGAS AREA OF LA PAZ. THE ESTIMATED COCA PRODUCTION IN THE CHAPARE AND YUNGAS REGIONS AMOUNTS TO 117,486 AND 73,634 TONS PER YEAR, RESPECTIVELY. THE OFFICIAL REPORT ADDS THAT 12,381 TONS OF COCA WERE EARMARKED FOR CHEWING AND THAT 132,038.3 TONS WERE USED TO PRODUCE COCAINE.
DEV-MUC3-0940	SANTIAGO, NO DATE -- RELATIONS BETWEEN CHILE AND BOLIVIA HAVE BEEN BROKEN. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE BEST WAY TO FACE BOLIVIA'S DEMAND FOR A SEA OUTLET? FIRST, CHILE MAINTAINS A FIRM STAND ON THIS SUBJECT, A FACT THAT MUST BE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD BY THE CHILEAN PEOPLE AND THE REST OF THE WORLD. CHILE DOES NOT HAVE ANY BORDER CONFLICTS WITH BOLIVIA. OUR BORDER WITH BOLIVIA HAS BEEN RATIFIED BY AN INTERNATIONAL TREATY THAT WAS FREELY APPROVED BY OUR TWO COUNTRIES. THIS TREATY CONSTITUTES AN OBLIGATORY NORM FOR CHILE AND BOLIVIA. SECOND, ACCORDING TO THIS TREATY, CHILE HAS ALWAYS BEEN WILLING TO GRANT BOLIVIA TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES TO PORTS ON THE PACIFIC COAST. THIRD, IN FACE OF THE BOLIVIAN ASPIRATIONS TO OBTAIN GREATER FACILITIES OR A NEW TRANSIT SYSTEM, THE FIRST THING TO BE DONE IS TO REESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. THIS IS A BILATERAL ISSUE BETWEEN BOLIVIA AND CHILE. IT IS NOT AN HEMISPHERIC MATTER OR A MATTER TO BE DECIDED BY INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. I TRUST THAT BOLIVIA AND CHILE WILL REESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION. WE MUST BE AWARE THAT THE WORLD IS HEADING TOWARD INTEGRATION AND THAT IT IS MORE CONVENIENT FOR ALL OF US TO ATTAIN THE BEST AND MOST INTEGRATED RELATIONS POSSIBLE. WE MUST SEEK SOLUTIONS AND, AS THE BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT RECENTLY STATED, WE MUST SEEK IMAGINATIVE SOLUTIONS WITH A 21ST CENTURY AND NOT A 19TH CENTURY VIEW. I HOPE THAT WITHIN THIS SPIRIT WE WILL MANAGE NOT ONLY TO REESTABLISH RELATIONS WITH BOLIVIA, BUT TO ESTABLISH SATISFACTORY RELATIONS FOR THE TWO COUNTRIES. CHILEAN RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES HAVE NOT BEEN EXCELLENT OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, AND THE MURDER OF ORLANDO LETELIER IS TIED INTO THIS SITUATION. WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON THIS SUBJECT, CONSIDERING THAT A U.S. COURT HAS REQUESTED THE EXTRADITION OF GENERAL CONTRERAS AND COLONEL ESPINOZA? WELL, I HOPE THAT CHILE WILL MAINTAIN THE BEST RELATIONS POSSIBLE WITH ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, A COUNTRY WITH WHICH WE ARE LINKED FOR MANY REASONS. I DISCUSSED THIS SUBJECT WITH PEOPLE FROM U.S. DIPLOMATIC, POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC CIRCLES, AND I HAVE NOTED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO IMPROVE RELATIONS AND SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY SEPARATING US AS SOON AS A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT IS REESTABLISHED. I DO NOT THINK THAT AN EXTRADITION WILL SOLVE THE LETELIER CASE BECAUSE IT HAS ALREADY BEEN RULED ON BY THE SUPREME COURT. IT IS WHAT WE LAWYERS REFER TO AS AN ADJUDGED MATTER. I THINK THAT CHILE CAN DEMONSTRATE ITS WILLINGNESS TO HELP CLARIFY THE CASE AND GUARANTEE JUSTICE, AS IT IS OUR PURPOSE IN ALL HUMAN RIGHTS PROBLEMS, SO AS TO SATISFY THE MOST DEMANDING CONSCIENCES OF THE WORLD.
DEV-MUC3-0941	SAN SALVADOR, 6 DEC 89 -- ...THE OFFENSIVE OF THE FMLN AS OF 11 NOVEMBER HAS BEEN MILITARILY DEFEATED HERE IN THE CITY OF SAN SALVADOR, AS WELL AS IN SAN MIGUEL, USULUTAN, AND ZACATECOLUCA, WHERE THERE WAS GREATER ACTIVITY BY THE SUBVERSIVES. LOGICALLY, AFTER BEING REJECTED SO MUCH, AFTER HAVING LOST SO MANY FIGTHERS AND WAR MATERIEL, THEY DO NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO AGAIN LAUNCH AN OPERATION LIKE THEY DID ON 11 NOVEMBER. THEY WILL CONTINUE WITH INDISCRIMINATE TERRORISM AND SELECTIVE TERRORISM. WE HAVE HERE SOME OF THE FIRST EVIDENCE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE MURDER OF A PERSON USEFUL TO SALVADORAN SOCIETY LIKE DR GUERRERO, THE ACTS OF SABOTAGE AGAINST THE ELECTRICITY SYSTEM, THE DESTRUCTION OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. WE CAN ALSO MENTION THE DESTRUCTION OF SOME GASOLINE STATIONS. BASICALLY, WHAT THEY SEEK IS TO SYSTEMATICALLY DESTROY THE ECONOMY OF THE COUNTRY, TO PROVOKE THE CLOSING OF SOME INDUSTRIAL CENTERS, AND TO BRING ABOUT ECONOMIC CHAOS. THAT IS WHY, EVEN THOUGH WE BELIEVED WE WERE TAKING RISKS IN THE MILITARY FIELD OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, THE ARMED FORCES CHANGED THE CURFEW HOURS, SO THAT CURFEW HOURS ARE NOW FROM 2300 TO 0500. WE DID THIS BELIEVING THAT THE ECONOMIC ASPECT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTRY, AND THAT IS WHY WE WANT TO BENEFIT THE INDUSTRIAL, BUSINESS, AND FARMING SECTORS, SO THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT THEIR ACTIVITIES UNDER ALMOST NORMAL CONDITIONS. WE ALSO CONSIDERED THAT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR WE ARE PICKING COFFEE AND COTTON AND HARVESTING SUGARCANE, AND THESE ARE THE THREE MAIN STAPLES OF OUR ECONOMY. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE MAINLY CARRIED OUT IN THE EVENING, AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE CHANGED THE CURFEW HOURS TO BENEFIT BUSINESSMEN, WORKERS, AND FARMERS SO THEY CAN SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES. COLONEL, DOES THE PRESIDENT THINK THAT DURING THE COSTA RICAN MEETING ENOUGH PRESSURE CAN BE EXERTED ON NICARAGUA SO THAT IT WILL SUSPEND ASSISTANCE TO THE FMLN AND THE WAR WILL DIMINISH IN THE COUNTRY? THE CYNICISM OF THE DICTATOR ORTEGA OF THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN FULLY PROVEN. IN THE PREVIOUS MEETINGS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF ESQUIPULAS II, HE COMMITTED HIMSELF TO DISCONTINUING SUPPORT FOR THE FMLN. THIS TOTAL WAR OFFENSIVE THAT HAS BEEN INFLICTED UPON THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SHOULD BE SUSPENDED, BECAUSE WE ARE SURE THAT THE MOMENT NICARAGUA AND CUBA -- IT IS THROUGH THOSE COUNTRIES, RATHER THOSE GOVERNMENTS THAT THE COMMUNIST BLOC HAS BEEN HELPING THE FMLN -- THE FMLN WOULD WEAKEN TREMENDOUSLY. AS A MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES, AS A MEMBER OF THE HIGH COMMAND, I FEEL VERY PROUD ABOUT THE PROFESSIONAL, DETERMINED, AND COURAGEOUS ATTITUDE WITH WHICH THE OFFICERS, NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND TROOPS OF OUR ARMED FORCES HAVE NEUTRALIZED AND DEFEATED THE FMLN OFFENSIVE. IN THIS REGARD, I BELIEVE THAT THE OPINIONS VOICED BY GENERAL THURMAN ARE NOT REALLY IN LINE WITH WHAT WE HAVE LIVED HERE INSIDE THE COUNTRY.
DEV-MUC3-0942	BOGOTA, 6 DEC 89 -- COMPATRIOTS, AS YOU KNOW, I CAME TO JAPAN TO FULFILL A MISSION IN THIS COUNTRY, WHICH HAS ALWAYS EXPRESSED ITS SOLIDARITY WITH COLOMBIA. I HAVE BEEN, HOWEVER, CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE COUNTRY'S SITUATION WITH DEEP SADNESS AND INDIGNATION AFTER THE CRIMINAL ATTACK ON THE DAS FACILITIES, WHICH DEEPLY SHOOK ALL COLOMBIANS. I HAVE BEEN IN CONSTANT TOUCH WITH CARLOS LEMOS SIMMONS, THE MINISTER DESIGNATED TO ACT ON MY BEHALF AND WITH MY CLOSEST ASSISTANTS. IN THE PAST FEW DAYS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN THE VILE ATTACKS CARRIED OUT BY THE DRUG TRAFFICKING CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION. THOSE ATTACKS HAVE TAKEN THE LIFE OF MANY INNOCENT COLOMBIANS. MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN, WHO WERE IN THE PRIME OF THEIR LIVES, HAVE BEEN SACRIFICED BY MAD ACTIONS CARRIED OUT BY CRIMINALS, WHO INTEND TO CONTROL AN ENTIRE PEOPLE, GOVERNMENT, AND COUNTRY THROUGH TERROR AND DESTRUCTION. THEY WILL NOT DEFEAT US. WE ARE AND WILL CONTINUE STRUGGLING. THE WAR HAS BEEN DECLARED ON THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AND ON DEMOCRACY. WE WILL NOT FALL UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE NARCOTERRORISTS' BLOODY TYRANNY. LAST NIGHT, THE COUNTRY LEARNED ABOUT THE COLOMBIAN CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES'S DECISION TO APPROVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS WITH THE INCLUSION OF THE EXTRADITION ISSUE IN THE REFERENDUM. THE CONFIRMATION THAT THE AVIANCA PLANE CRASH WAS CAUSED BY A BOMB; THE MURDER OF BERNARDO JARAMILLO URIBE, ROVING 13TH JUDGE OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION; AND THIS MORNING'S ATROCIOUS ATTACK ON THE DAS FACILITIES FURTHER PROVES THAT THE DECISION MADE BY THE CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES IS HIGHLY UNSUITABLE FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. WE ABSOLUTELY CANNOT ACCEPT DRUG TRAFFICKERS TRYING TO FORCE OUR LEGISLATORS TO ADOPT A DECISION THAT WOULD ONLY BRING MORE DESTRUCTION AND DEATH TO COLOMBIA, BECAUSE IF THE INCLUSION OF THE EXTRADITION ISSUE IS APPROVED IN THE REFERENDUM, IT WOULD NOT BE A DECISION MADE BY THE SOVEREIGN WILL OF THE PEOPLE, BUT BY THE FORCE OF BULLETS AND TERROR. COLOMBIANS HAVE UNFORTUNATELY PAID TOO HIGH A PRICE TO FIND OUT WHAT THESE CRIMINALS REALLY THINK. THEY SPOKE ABOUT A TRUCE AND THEN THEY MURDERED A JUDGE. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES APPROVED THE INCLUSION OF THE EXTRADITION ISSUE INTO THE REFERENDUM AND, IN GOOD FAITH, MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT WAS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD PEACE WITH THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS. THEY WERE WRONG. THE NEXT DAY THE DAS FACILITIES WERE ATTACKED. THOSE ACTIONS PROVE WHAT THOSE CRIMINALS ARE CAPABLE OF DOING TO OBTAIN A FAVORABLE DECISION IN THE REFERENDUM. THEY DO NOT CONDUCT AN ELECTION CAMPAIGN, BUT A CAMPAIGN OF TERROR TO ATTAIN THEIR GOALS. I NOW REITERATE WHAT I SAID IN MY SPEECH BEFORE LEAVING FOR JAPAN. I SAID THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS WITH THE INCLUSION OF THE REFERENDUM IS HIGHLY UNSUITABLE. I SHARE THE SORROW AND SADNESS OF ALL MY COMPATRIOTS, ESPECIALLY VICTIMS' RELATIVES. OUR INDIGNATION MUST REPRESENT ALL COLOMBIANS' INTENTION TO JOIN EFFORTS AND DROP PERSONAL INTERESTS. COMPATRIOTS, WE MUST NEVER, WE WILL NEVER SUCCUMB TO THE NARCOTERRORISTS. THE STABLE DEMOCRACY WE HAVE BUILT AND DEFENDED WITH GREAT EFFORT FOR OVER 1 CENTURY IS ENDANGERED. THROUGHOUT ITS HISTORY, COLOMBIA HAS OVERCOME MORE DIFFICULT TIMES. LET US ALL STAND UP WITH FAITH, COURAGE, AND FIRMNESS TO DEFEND OUR HOMELAND AND FREEDOM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
DEV-MUC3-0943	CLANDESTINE, 7 DEC 89 -- ATTENTION. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION. FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT TROOPS STARTED TO ATTACK ENEMY POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR AT 2200 ON 6 DECEMBER, ENTERING THE CITY FROM THE NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, AND WEST. ATTENTION. REPORT FROM SOYAPANGO, SAN SALVADOR. FMLN ANTIAIRCRAFT UNITS HAVE DOWNED AN ARMED FORCES HELICOPTER GUNSHIP DURING THE BATTLES THAT HAVE BEEN ONGOING IN SOYPANGO. WE AWAIT THE OFFICIAL MILITARY REPORT ON THIS ACTION IN SAN SALVADOR. WE ARE NO LONGER ONLY DOWNING AIRPLANES AND HELICOPTERS IN THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY. THOUSANDS OF SAN SALVADOR RESIDENTS WERE ABLE TO SEE THE DOWNING OF A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP IN THE METROPOLITAN AREA. WE DOWNED A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP THAT WAS SHOOTING AT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN SOYAPANGO, SAN SALVADOR. WE HAD ALREADY WARNED BUSTILLO. WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW WOMEN, CHILDREN, AND RESIDENTS OF SAN SALVADOR TO BE BOMBED AGAIN. WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW MORE GENOCIDIAL ACTIONS IN SAN SALVADOR. ONCE AND FOR ALL, WE REAFFIRM TO THE FASCIST COMMAND STAFF THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW MORE BOMBING IN SAN SALVADOR. STARTING RIGHT NOW, GENTLEMEN, THE PEOPLE FORBID THAT YOU BOMB THE CITY. WE FORBID YOU TO DO SO, AND FOR THAT PURPOSE WE WILL DOWN YOUR AIRPLANES AND HELICOPTERS. OUR PEOPLE KNOW THAT AN A-37 AIRCRAFT WAS DOWNED IN SAN MIGUEL, A HELICOPTER WAS DOWNED IN SAN MIGUEL AT THE BEGINNING OF THE OFFENSIVE, A PUSH-PULL PLANE WAS DOWNED IN USULUTAN, AND NOW THIS HELICOPTER IN SOYAPANGO. WE AWAIT A REPORT ON THE POSSIBLE DEATH OF THE HELICOPTER'S CREW. WE AWAIT AN OFFICIAL REPORT FROM OUR COMRADES IN SOYAPANGO. MEANWHILE, WE ALSO HAVE REPORTS THAT FIGHTING CONTINUES AT THIS TIME IN THE NORTHEASTERN AREA OF SAN SALVADOR. WE AWAIT AN OFFICIAL REPORT ON THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES THAT HAVE BEEN INFLICTED ON THE ENEMY. OUR MEN HAVE INFLICTED MANY CASUALTIES ON SOLDIERS FROM THE ATCATL BATTALION, BELLOSO BATTALION, PARATROOPERS BATTALION, NATIONAL POLICE, TREASURY POLICE, 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE, SONSONATE MILITARY DETACHMENT NO 6, AND 5TH INFANTRY BRIGADE DURING THE CLASHES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE LAST NIGHT.
DEV-MUC3-0944	BOGOTA, 7 DEC 89 -- COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO HAS BROUGHT FORWARD HIS RETURN TO THE COUNTRY BY 10 HOURS, MEANING HE HAS CANCELLED SOME EVENTS HE WAS SCHEDULED TO ATTEND IN TOKYO, AND WILL RETURN TO THE COUNTRY AROUND NOON ON 9 DECEMBER. HE WAS INITIALLY SCHEDULED TO RETURN AROUND MIDNIGHT ON SATURDAY. PRESIDENT BARCO TOLD THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TODAY THAT IN NO WAY WILL COLOMBIA ACCEPT THE INTERVENTION OF FOREIGN TROOPS TO FIGHT TERRORISM, VIOLENCE, AND ORGANIZED CRIME. DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE WITH JAPANESE AND FOREIGN MEDIA REPRESENTATIVES IN TOKYO, PRESIDENT BARCO ALSO SAID THAT THE LIBERAL PARTY WILL PROBABLY WIN THE 1990 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS BECAUSE IT HAS CAPABLE PEOPLE AND IT IS THE MAJORITY PARTY. HE ALSO REFERRED TO A MID-AIR PLANE EXPLOSION -- A TERRORIST ACTION, IN HIS WORDS -- AND THE ATTACK PERPETRATED AGAINST THE DAS HEADQUARTERS IN BOGOTA WITH APPROXIMATELY 500 KG OF EXPLOSIVES. PRESIDENT BARCO WILL RETURN TO BOGOTA AT 0900 ON 9 DECEMBER. HE WILL DEPART FROM NARITA AIRPORT, LOCATED 2 HOURS FROM TOKYO, MEETING WITH JAPANESE INVESTORS AND POSSIBLE BUYERS OF COLOMBIAN COFFEE. THE EVENT WAS ORGANIZED BY THE COLOMBIAN COFFEE GROWERS ASSOCIATION AND THE GRAN COLOMBIAN MERCHANT FLEET'S REPRESENTATIVES IN THE FAR EAST. APPROXIMATELY 2 WEEKS AGO AN AIRPLANE EXPLODED WHEN TAKING OFF FROM BOGOTA, AND EXPERTS WHO CAME FROM MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD HAVE DISCOVERED THAT IT WAS CAUSED BY A BOMB PLACED ON BOARD RATHER THAN A PROBLEM OF PRESSURIZATION. THE OTHER CASE IS THE ATTACK WHICH WAS PERPETRATED LAST NIGHT, 2 NIGHTS AGO, AGAINST THE INTELLIGENCE HEADQUARTERS OF THE NATIONAL POLICE. YOU HAVE READ OR REPORTED THAT A LARGE AMOUNT... ABOUT 500 KG OF DYNAMITE PLACED IN A TRUCK EXPLODED AND CAUSED THE COLLAPSE OR CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE OF THE GENERAL HEADQUARTERS OF THE COLOMBIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES. THE TERRORIST ATTACK WAS PERPETRATED AGAINST THE OFFICES OF THE DAS, WHICH IS -- AS I SAID BEFORE -- WHERE THE MOST IMPORTANT INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES AGAINST ORGANIZED CRIME AND DRUG TRAFFICKING ARE CARRIED OUT.
DEV-MUC3-0945	TOKYO , 7 DEC 89 -- COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS SAID HERE ON THURSDAY HIS GOVERNMENT WILL NOT BOW TO TERRORIST THREATS EXEMPLIFIED BY WEDNESDAY'S BOMB EXPLOSION IN BOGOTA. BARCO, WHO IS ON A FOUR-DAY VISIT TO JAPAN THROUGH FRIDAY, SAID THAT SUCH SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES ARE BASED ON THE MISTAKEN BELIEF OF TERRORISTS THAT VIOLENCE CAN TOPPLE THE GOVERNMENT. HE SAID HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD FIGHT OFF SUCH CHALLENGES. A TRUCK, PACKED WITH DYNAMITE, EXPLODED IN FRONT OF THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE SECURITY, COLOMBIA'S FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS POLICE, ON WEDNESDAY. AT LEAST 35 PEOPLE DIED AND 350 PEOPLE WERE WOUNDED IN THE BLAST, WHICH IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN RELATED TO THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT'S ATTEMPTS TO ELIMINATE THE DRUG TRADE. COLOMBIA IS SAID TO BE THE LARGEST EXPORTER OF THE ILLICIT DRUG, COCAINE, TO THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES. THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS INTENSIFIED ITS CRACKDOWN ON THE COCAINE SMUGGLERS SINCE THE ASSASSINATION OF A LEADING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ON AUGUST 18. BARCO, SPEAKING AT THE JAPAN NATIONAL PRESS CLUB EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT AN INCREASE OF COCAINE CONSUMPTION IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, AND CALLED FOR WESTERN INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS TO HELP STABILIZE THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN COLOMBIA, WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON MORE ECONOMIC SUPPORT. ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY COLOMBIA WOULD CALL ON THE UNITED STATES TO HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH ARMED FORCES, THE PRESIDENT EMPHASIZED HE HAS NO INTENTION OF ALLOWING ANY INTERFERENCE BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN HIS NATION. BARCO IS SCHEDULED TO LEAVE JAPAN FOR COLOMBIA FRIDAY.
DEV-MUC3-0946	CLANDESTINE, 7 DEC 89 -- ATTENTION, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PRESS. THIS IS A REPORT FROM SAN SALVADOR. THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT REPORTS THAT AS OF 2200 ON 6 DECEMBER, FMLN COLUMNS INSIDE THE CAPITAL CITY, STAGED ATTACKS ON MILITARY GARRISONS, AND CARRIED OUT SABOTAGE ACTIVITIES IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. AFTER BREAKING UP THE ENEMY'S DEFENSIVE POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR, THE FMLN OCCUPIED VARIOUS AREAS IN THE CAPITAL. THE GENERAL STAFF INSTALLATIONS WERE ATTACKED WITH 60-MM MORTARS. AND AIR SUPPORT AGAINST OUR POSITIONS. WE ARE AWAITING DETAILED REPORTS OF THIS ATTACK ON THE GENERAL STAFF WITH 60-MM MORTARS. SIMULTANEOUSLY, OUR GUERRILLA COLUMNS IN SAN SALVADOR ESTABLISHED POSITIONS IN SAN BENITO, ESCALON, LA MASCOTA, AND MAQUILIGUAT NEIGHBORHOODS, AND ALSO IN SAN ANTONIO ABAD AND THE NORTHERN PERIPHERY OF THE GENERAL STAFF INSTALLATIONS, BATTLING WITH MARINES, MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 7 FROM AGUACHAPAN, THE ELITE BATTALIONS STATIONED THERE, NATIONAL POLICE FORCES, AND UNITS FROM THE SAN BENITO BATTALION, WHICH IS IN CHARGE OF GUARDING THE GENERAL STAFF INSTALLATIONS. IT IS REPORTED THAT ONE M-16 RIFLE, PISTOLS, MILITARY EQUIPMENT, AND A LARGE QUANTITY OF AMMUNITION WERE SEIZED FROM THE ARMY. AT 0100, OUR ANTIAIRCRAFT UNITS OPENED FIRE ON TWO HELICOPTERS IN ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD. ONE OF THEM WAS A TRANSPORT HELICOPTER AND THE OTHER A GUNSHIP. BOTH WERE DAMAGED. MEANWHILE, OUR GUERRILLAS ALSO USED MORTARS DURING AN ATTACK ON THE SAN BENITO BATTALION'S POSITIONS NEAR ZONA ROSA. AT THE SAME TIME, AN ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT AGAINST THE CETIPOL POLICE ACADEMY IN SANTA TECLA, USING 81-MM MORTARS. ATTACKS WERE STAGED AGAINST THE CETIPOL'S PERIPHERAL DEFENSE FROM ANOTHER DIRECTION UNTIL LATE THIS MORNING. MEANWHILE, AN ATTACK CARRIED OUT FROM THE NORTHERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR LED TO INCURSIONS IN SOYAPANGO, MEJICANOS, AND AYUTUXTEPEQUE. IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE THE FMLN CARRIED OUT ANNIHILATION MANEUVERS AGAINST THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE'S SORIANO BATTALION, WHICH WAS STATIONED ON EL CARMEN HILL WHERE WE KILLED 15 SOLDIERS AND WOUNDED 30. AMONG THESE CASUALTIES IS AN OFFICER FROM THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE. THE FMLN SEIZED FIVE M-16 RIFLES, ONE GRENADE LAUNCHER, , FOUR M-60 MACHINEGUNS FROM THE ANNIHILATED TROOPS. A MILITARY VEHICLE WAS PARTIALLY DESTROYED, AND AN ENEMY PATROL WAS TOTALLY DESTROYED. PRAL REINFORCEMENT UNITS ATTEMPTED TO SUPPORT THE ARMY TROOPS UNDER ATTACK BUT THEY WERE REPELLED BY THE FMLN. THE ELECTRICITY SYSTEM IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CAPITAL CITY WAS SABOTAGED, LEAVING 90 PERCENT OF THE CITY WITHOUT POWER. ATTENTION. HERE IS THE REPORT ON THE HELICOPTER DOWNED IN SOYAPANGO. ATTENTION. ON 6 DECEMBER THERE WERE CLASHES IN SAN JOSE CORTEZ, JURISDICTION OF SOYAPANGO, WITH THE BELLOSO BATTALION WHICH RECEIVED STRONG AERIAL SUPPORT UP UNTIL THE AFTERNOON HOURS. HELICOPTERS MACHINEGUNNED AND ROCKETED THIS DENSELY POPULATED AREA. OUR ANTIAIRCRAFT UNITS, REAFFIRMING OUR DETERMINATION TO DEFEND THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AGAINST AERIAL ATTACKS, OPENED FIRE AND HIT A GUNSHIP. THE GUNSHIP FELL TO THE GROUND AT THE MORAZAN TOBACCO COMPANY. GUERRILLA UNITS SIMULTANEOUSLY ATTACKED PARAMILITARY FORCES IN TONACATEPEQUE DURING THE EARLY HOURS OF 7 DECEMBER, WHICH PROMPTED AERIAL SUPPORT BECAUSE THIS AREA IS ON THE AIR FORCE'S SECURITY PERIMETER, BUT CALLS FROM THE BATTALION THAT WAS BEING ANNIHILATED ON THE EL CARMEN HILL IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE WENT UNHEEDED. THESE ARE THE FIRST REPORTS ON ALL THE ACTIVITIES UNDER WAY IN SAN SALVADOR, WHERE AT 2200 ON 6 DECEMBER OUR GUERRILLA UNITS BEGAN TO FORCE AND BREAK THE DAM THAT THE HIGH COMMAND BUILT AT THE GENERAL STAFF'S BUNKER OUR COLUMNS, UNTIL THEY PENETRATED THE AFOREMENTIONED AREAS, FIGHTING IN THE ESCALON AND SAN BENITO NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THE OLIGARCHS LIVE. ACTIONS HAVE ALSO TAKEN PLACE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. FACTORIES HAVE BEEN SABOTAGED, STRATEGIC HIGHWAYS HAVE BEEN CONTROLLED, POSITIONS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED, AND TOWNS HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED. WE WILL FURNISH FURTHER INFORMATION LATER.
DEV-MUC3-0947	CARACAS , 7 DEC 89 -- VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ PREDICTED A SERIOUS CRISIS ON THE CONTINENT IF A SOLUTION FOR THE CENTRAL AMERICAN CONFLICT IS NOT FOUND. HE APPEALED TO "THE FOREIGN POWERS" TO HALT THEIR INTERVENTION IN THE SUBREGION. IN A NEWS CONFERENCE BROADCAST OVER TELEVISION FOR ALL THE COUNTRY, PEREZ TODAY PREDICTED THAT THE COMING CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS SUMMIT TO BE HELD IN SAN JOSE WILL FAIL IF WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS "FOREIGN POWERS" DO NOT HALT MILITARY AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE VARIOUS FACTIONS FIGHTING IN THE CONVULSED REGION. THE COSTA RICAN, NICARAGUAN, GUATEMALAN, SALVADORAN, AND HONDURAN PRESIDENTS WILL MEET IN SAN JOSE SHORTLY TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT AND REACTIVATE THE ESQUIPULAS II AND TELA PACIFICATION ACCORDS. "IF THE FOREIGN POWERS, BE THEY THE UNITED STATES, CUBA, THE SOVIET UNION, OR WHATEVER, PERSIST ON DISTURBING A DIRECT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTING A FRIENDLY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, THIS SUMMIT WILL COME TO NOTHING," PEREZ POINTED OUT. PEREZ SAID THAT THE RECENT FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT OFFENSIVE IN EL SALVADOR INTERFERED SERIOUSLY WITH THE REGIONAL PACIFICATION PROCESS. HE REQUESTED THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT CLARIFY THE DEATH OF SIX JESUITS WHO WERE MURDERED BY THE DEATH SQUADS. "THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE SALVADORAN CRISIS OCCURRED AT AN UNTIMELY MOMENT, WHEN THINGS WERE GOING SO WELL. THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS, HOWEVER, RESTS HEAVILY WITH THE FMLN AND THOSE WHO GAVE ARMS TO THE REBELS SO THEY COULD CARRY OUT SO MAJOR A MILITARY OPERATION," HE SAID. HE ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT "THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SIX JESUITS, WHO WERE MURDERED IN A LOWLY AND WICKED MANNER. THIS MUST BE CLARIFIED ALSO," HE SAID. THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT, WHO OFFERED TO MEDIATE IN THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT, SAID HE REPORTED TO COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS, THE SUMMIT'S HOST, THE CONTENTS OF A LETTER THAT THE FMLN SENT TO PEREZ, IN WHICH THE ORGANIZATION PROPOSES A CEASE-FIRE WITH INTERNATIONAL VERIFICATION. PEREZ ASKED THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE BECAUSE "THE FATE OF ALL OF LATIN AMERICA IS AT STAKE." REFERRING DIRECTLY TO THE SAN JOSE SUMMIT -- HE SAID HE WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN CHOOSING COSTA RICA AS SITE FOR THE MEETING -- PEREZ ASSUMED AN "OPTIMISTIC YET CONCERNED" STANCE WITH REGARD TO THE MEETING'S RESULTS. HE FINALLY SAID: "THIS SAN JOSE SUMMIT WILL MAKE THINGS CONFORM TO ESQUIPULAS II AND TELA IF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ARE LEFT ALONE AND PARTICULARLY IF THEY KNOW THAT NONE OF THEM WILL BE BACKED BY ANY ONE POWER WITH ARMS OR MONEY."
DEV-MUC3-0948	BOGOTA, 7 DEC 89 -- INVESTIGATIONS CONTINUE TO DETERMINE WHO PLACED A CAR BOMB IN FRONT OF THE DAS FACILITIES. ACCORDING TO THE DAS DIRECTOR, A SPANISH TERRORIST AND ETA MEMBER WHO COULD HAVE ADVISED THE COLOMBIANS ON THE PREPARATION OF THE CAR BOMB HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED. DAS DIRECTOR GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ ATTENDED THE FUNERAL OF HIS SUBORDINATES AND FELLOW WORKERS WHO WERE KILLED AS A RESULT OF AN EXPLOSION IN FRONT OF THE DAS FACILITIES. AT THE END OF THE RELIGIOUS CEREMONY, GEN MAZA SAID THAT HE DOES NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT FOREIGN TERRORISTS PARTICIPATED IN THE ATTEMPT ON HIS LIFE. THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT THIS COULD BE SO, BECAUSE THE METHODS AND SYSTEM USED TO FABRICATE THE CAR BOMB LEAD US TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE EXPERTS IN THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY. GEN MAZA, WITH SADNESS IN HIS EYES, ADDED THAT HE WILL CONTINUE WORKING IN THE SAME OFFICE WHERE THE ATTACK OCCURRED.
DEV-MUC3-0949	LIMA, 7 DEC 89 -- PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA ANNOUNCED THAT THE BORDERS WILL BE REOPENED. HE SAID THAT THE RESULTS OF THE MEASURES ADOPTED 15 DAYS AGO ARE POSITIVE. THE PRESIDENT CALLED ON ALL BUSINESSMEN AND INDUSTRIALISTS NOT TO SPECULATE ON PRICES. HE ALSO REITERATED HIS SUPPORT FOR ECONOMY AND FINANCE MINISTER CESAR VASQUEZ BAZAN, WHO HE SAID IS MAKING GREAT EFFORTS TO FACE THE PERUVIAN ECONOMIC SITUATION. GARCIA MADE THESE STATEMENTS AFTER A MEETING WITH THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS. THE BORDER CLOSURE MEASURE EXPIRES TODAY. WILL IT BE EXTENDED? NO, THE BORDERS WERE NEVER CLOSED. WE ONLY ESTABLISHED SOME RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF TRANSIT PERMITS IN TACNA TO PREVENT AN INCREASE OF SMUGGLING BEFORE THE YEAR-END FESTIVITIES. THE 15-DAY TERM OF THAT MEASURE HAS EXPIRED, AND IT WILL NOT BE EXTENDED. APPARENTLY, THAT MEASURE HAS NOT HAD GOOD RESULTS. I THINK THAT IN GENERAL IT HAS YIELDED POSITIVE RESULTS BECAUSE SMUGGLING HAS PROBABLY DECREASED SOMEWHAT. AS YOU KNOW, A FEW YEARS AGO CHILE ESTABLISHED THE IQUIQUE FREE ZONE WHERE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD TO PERU AND BOLIVIA. THUS A STABLE MARKET OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHICH DAILY PASS THOROUGH THE TACNA BORDER WITH SMALL PACKAGES HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. WE SIMPLY RESTRICTED THE PERMITS THEY USE TO BRING IN A TAPE RECORDER OR LASER DISC PLAYERS. I UNDERSTAND THAT SMUGGLING DECREASED FOR A FEW DAYS. HOWEVER, THAT MERCHANDISE ENTERED THE COUNTRY BY OTHER MEANS. WE CANNOT IMPOSE TOO MANY RESTRICTIONS, BUT WE CAN ASK THE CUSTOMS OFFICE AND THE POLICE TO INCREASE THEIR EFFORTS TO CONTROL EXCESSIVE SMUGGLING INTO THE COUNTRY. DO YOU THINK THAT THE FREE-MARKET DOLLAR WILL DROP BY JANUARY? I AM SURE IT WILL. LAST YEAR, LIKE NOW, THE FREE- MARKET DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE INCREASED SHARPLY BECAUSE COMPANIES ARE PAYING YEAR-END BONUSES AND THEY ARE CONVERTING THEIR PROFITS INTO DOLLARS. PEOPLE ARE TAKING HOLIDAY TRIPS AND BUYING MORE GOODS AND HOME APPLIANCES. THEREFORE, THE DOLLAR DEMAND AND PRICES HAVE INCREASED. LAST YEAR, WHEN THE MUC DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE WAS AT 500 INTIS TO A DOLLAR, THE FREE-MARKET DOLLAR CLIMBED TO 2,000 INTIS. LATER IT DROPPED TO 1,000 INTIS IN JANUARY. I THINK THAT THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN THIS YEAR. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME RUMORS IN THE PAST FEW DAYS THAT THE ECONOMY MINISTER IS ABOUT TO RESIGN OR IS BEING PRESSURED TO RESIGN. IS THIS TRUE? THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD PRESSURE HIM IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC, AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT I AM NOT PRESSURING HIM. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE CURRENT DIFFICULTIES OF THE PERUVIAN ECONOMY AS WELL AS THE EFFORTS OF THE ECONOMY MINISTER. I EXPRESS MY RECOGNITION OF AND SUPPORT FOR THE ECONOMY MINISTER BECAUSE HE IS YOUNG, WELL-INTENTIONED, AND VERY HONEST; HE HAS PROGRESSIVE IDEAS. HE IS MAKING EVERY EFFORT POSSIBLE TO STABILIZE THE ECONOMY AS WELL AS POSSIBLE, AND HE SPONSORED A DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION AFTER THE ELECTIONS. TODAY DID THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS DISCUSS A WAGE INCREASE FOR THIS MONTH? THAT POINT MUST BE DEFINED BY THE ECONOMY AND LABOR MINISTERS. TODAY, IN ADDITION TO THE BORDER ISSUE, WE DISCUSSED A SUBJECT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT A FEW WEEKS AGO. ON THAT OCCASION I LISTENED TO A REPORT FROM THE SO-CALLED COMMANDER HUAIHUACU. HE IS CHIEF OF SOME 85 PEASANT COMMUNITIES ALONG THE APURIMAC RIVER WHICH HAVE REBELLED AGAINST SHINING PATH CONTROL. THE APURIMAC RIVER SEPARATES THE AYACUCHO AND CUSCO DEPARTMENTS, AND THESE PEASANTS LIVE IN AN AREA CALLED OREJA DE PERRO IN LA MAR PROVINCE. THEY HAVE CARRIED OUT A DEMOCRATIC UPRISING AND ORGANIZED THEMSELVES TO KEEP SHINING PATH FROM ENTERING THEIR COMMUNITIES. THIS SO-CALLED COMMANDER HUAIHUACU, WHO IS A MAN OF ACTION, HAS ORGANIZED APPROXIMATELY 85 COMMUNITIES ON THE BANKS OF THE APURIMAC RIVER, IN AYACUCHO PROVINCE OF LA MAR AND THE CUSCO DISTRICT OF CHARATE. HUAIHUACU HAS COME TO LIMA SEEKING SUPPORT. WE HAVE DECIDED WITH THE DEFENSE MINISTRY TO GO TOMORROW TO RINCONADA BAJA AREA IN LA MAR PROVINCE, SHINING PATH'S PRIMARY AREA OF ACTIVITY FOR 10 YEARS. THERE I WILL DEDICATE A RADIO STATION TO BE CALLED RADIO DEMOCRACIA. ITS AIM WILL BE TO BROADCAST NEWS AND DEMOCRATIC AND PATRIOTIC MESSAGES FROM THAT AREA WHICH IS A CENTER OF PEASANT RESISTANCE AGAINST TERRORISM. WE WILL ARRIVE THERE TOMORROW AND TALK WITH THE PEASANT LEADERS WHO FOR YEARS HAVE FOUGHT SHINING PATH TOGETHER WITH OUR NAVY INFANTRY UNITS STATIONED IN LUISIANA AND SAN FRANCISCO.
DEV-MUC3-0950	SAN SALVADOR, 8 DEC 89 -- THE ELECTRIC AND LIGHT COMPANY OF EL SALVADOR, CAESS, HAS REPORTED THAT DUE TO THE TERRORIST SABOTAGE AGAINST THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM, THE COMPANY HAS RATIONED THE ELECTRICITY FOR A 5-HOUR PERIOD IN DIFFERENT ZONES OF THE CAPITAL. CAESS UNITS HAVE TOURED THE CAPITAL AND, AS 7 DECEMBER, THEY HAD NOT FOUND ANY DESTROYED POLE. THEREFORE, THE DAMAGE HAS BEEN CAUSED IN THE COUNTRY SIDE. THE RATIONING OF ELECTRICITY ON 8 DECEMBER WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE SECTOR OF ESCALON, SAN BENITO, PLANES DE RENDERO, SAN JACINTO, SAN MARCOS, AND OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS HAD NO ELECTRICITY BETWEEN 0800 AND 1300. THE MIRAMONTE NEIGHBORHOOD, METROCENTRO, NORTHERN HIGHWAY UP TO MATRICES FROSTY, LA TIENDONA, CONCEPCION STREET, SAN JOAQUIN NEIGHBORHOOD, AND SOYAPANGO RESIDENTIAL AREAS HAD NO ELECTRICITY BETWEEN 1300 AND 1800. SAN MIGUEL, LA UNION, SAN FRANCISCO GOTERA, AND SAN FRANCISCO DE LIMA ARE SUPPLIED ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE SAN MIGUEL EMERGENCY PLAN. ACCORDING TO CAESS SPOKESMEN, THE INSTITUTION IS WORKING WITH ONLY 50 PERCENT OF ITS CAPACITY IN THE CAPITAL.
DEV-MUC3-0951	SAN SALVADOR, 8 DEC 89 -- A PUBLIC OPINION POLL CONDUCTED BY THE A.M.S. COMPANY AMONG THE SALVADORAN PUBLIC ON 5 AND 6 DECEMBER REVEALS THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S OUTRIGHT REPUDIATION OF THE FMLN TERRORIST OFFENSIVE. ACCORDING TO SOURCES CLOSE TO THE LABOR UNION SECTOR, THE A.M.S. COMPANY, WHICH HAS BEEN WORKING IN EL SALVADOR FOR MANY YEARS, SPECIALIZES IN PUBLIC OPINION POLLS THAT ENJOY GREAT RESPECT AND CREDIBILITY BECAUSE OF THEIR EFFICIENCY, ACCURACY, AND RELIABILITY. THE POLL'S RESULTS SHOW CLEAR AND STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE ROLE THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE PLAYED. AT THE SAME TIME, THE POLL REVEALS A CLEAR REJECTION OF THE DAMAGE INFLICTED BY TERRORISM AND THE POSSIBLE PARTICIPATION OF THE FMLN IN THE MURDERS OF THE FENASTRAS LEADERS AND THE JESUIT PRIESTS. DESPITE ALL THE SUFFERING RESULTING FROM THE SNEAKY, SUBVERSIVE ATTACK AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR YEARNING FOR PEACE, THE MAJORITY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE BELIEVES THE DIALOGUE PROCESS MUST CONTINUE. IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION AS TO HOW THEY WOULD RATE THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES' ROLE, 37 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE CHARACTERIZED IT AS EXCELLENT; 44 PERCENT AS GOOD; 9.3 PERCENT AS AVERAGE; 2.7 PERCENT AS BAD; 0.3 PERCENT AS VERY BAD; AND 6.7 PERCENT DID NOT RESPOND. AS TO HOW WOULD THEY RATE THE JOB DONE BY THE GOVERNMENT, 21.3 PERCENT CHARACTERIZED IT AS EXCELLENT; 54.3 PERCENT AS GOOD; 15 PERCENT AS AVERAGE; 2.7 PERCENT AS BAD; 0.3 PERCENT AS VERY BAD; AND 6.4 PERCENT DID NOT RESPOND. AS TO HOW WOULD THEY DESCRIBE PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S PERFORMANCE, 29 PERCENT SAID EXCELLENT; 51.3 GOOD; 11 PERCENT AVERAGE; 1.3 BAD; 0 PERCENT VERY BAD; AND 7.4 PERCENT DID NOT RESPOND. WHEN ASKED WHO THEY THOUGHT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BREAKING OF THE DIALOGUE, 63 PERCENT SAID THE FMLN; 5.7 PERCENT SAID THE ARMED FORCES; 4.3 PERCENT SAID THE GOVERNMENT; 22.7 PERCENT SAID THEY DO NOT KNOW; AND 3.9 PERCENT DID NOT RESPOND. WHEN ASKED WHO THEY BELIEVED WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FENASTRAS MASSACRE, 26.3 PERCENT SAID THE FMLN; 6.3 PERCENT SAID THE ARMED FORCES; 3.3 PERCENT SAID THE GOVERNMENT; 55.7 PERCENT SAID THEY DID NOT KNOW; AND 8.4 PERCENT DID NOT RESPOND. REGARDING THE MASSACRE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, 26 PERCENT ATTRIBUTED IT TO THE FMLN; 7 PERCENT TO THE ARMED FORCES; 5.3 PERCENT TO THE GOVERNMENT; 53.3 PERCENT SAID THEY DID NOT KNOW; AND 8.4 PERCENT DID NOT RESPOND.

DEV-MUC3-0952	SAN SALVADOR, 9 DEC 89 -- COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, HAS SAID THAT AN ALL-OUT PERSECUTION CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE FMLN TERRORIST ASSASSINS HAS BEGUN AND 25 ANTI-AIRCRAFT MISSILES HAVE BEEN CONFISCATED. THE HIGH COMMAND HAS ORDERED AN ALL-OUT CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE TERRORISTS, WHO HAVE BEEN DISLODGED FROM THE URBAN AREAS AND FORCED INTO THE NORTH OF SOYAPANGO AND SOUTH OF ANTIGUO CUSCATLAN. THE OFFICER SAID THAT COMMUNIST ASSASSINS HAVE BEEN HARD HIT BECAUSE MANY HAVE BEEN KILLED AND WOUNDED AND LARGE AMOUNTS OF ARMS AND AMMUNITION HAVE BEEN CONFISCATED. THE ARMED FORCES REPORTED THAT 110 TERRORISTS HAVE DIED DURING FIGHTING IN SAN SALVADOR'S NORTH AND SOUTHEAST AREAS. PONCE ALSO SAID THAT TROOPS HAVE CONFISCATED FROM THE FMLN 25 ANTI-AIRCRAFT MISSILES -- 24 OF WHICH WERE SAM-7'S -- 915 RIFLES, 12 CARBINES, 41 SUBMACHINEGUNS AND MORE WAR MATERIEL. THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS DENOUNCED THE FACT THAT THE NICARAGUAN REGIME SUPPLIES THE FMLN TERRORISTS WITH POWERFUL WEAPONS -- ESPECIALLY SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES -- WHICH SO FAR HAVE MISSED HITTING ARMED FORCES AIRPLANES. PONCE ADDED THAT ANY TERRORIST ATTEMPTS TO ENTER THE CAPITAL WILL BE NEUTRALIZED.
DEV-MUC3-0953	SAN JOSE , 8 DEC 89 -- IN A DOCUMENT ON THE OCCASION OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT THAT OPENS ON 10 DECEMBER, THE GENERAL COMMAND OF THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY TODAY CHARGED THAT "GUATEMALA IS EXPERIENCING A GRAVE CRISIS, " AND ADDED THAT "PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO SHOULD NO LONGER CONCEAL IT." IN A LENGTHY DOCUMENT DISTRIBUTED TODAY, THE URNG REPORTED THE "UNCONTROLLABLE WAVE OF VIOLENCE AND THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. IN ONLY 3 MONTHS, THE PRESS HAS REPORTED THE DISCOVERY OF 137 BODIES, MOST OF THEM WITH SIGNS OF TORTURE, 79 PEOPLE WHO WERE ARRESTED BUT WHO HAVE DISAPPEARED, 23 PEOPLE KILLED IN MASSACRES, AND 143 ASSASSINATIONS." THE URNG ASKED THAT "THE PRESIDENTS ATTENDING THE SAN JOSE SUMMIT TO ANALYZE THE CASE OF GUATEMALA, WHICH IS AS SERIOUS AS THAT OF EL SALVADOR OR NICARAGUA." THE DOCUMENT IS SIGNED BY COMMANDERS ROLANDO MORAN, PABLO MONSATO, GASPAR ILOM, AND CARLOS GONZALEZ, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE ORGANIZATION .
DEV-MUC3-0954	SAN SALVADOR, 9 DEC 89 -- PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI TODAY PROPOSED TO THE GUERRILLAS GROUPS THE RENEWAL OF PEACE TALKS IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA, ON 20 DECEMBER -- PROVIDED THE LATTER "CEASE ALL TERRORIST ACTIONS" EFFECTIVE NEXT WEEK. DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE SHORTLY BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE FOR SAN JOSE, WHERE HE WILL ATTEND THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS' SUMMIT, CRISTIANI ASKED THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT TO SUSPEND -- NO LATER THAN "15 DECEMBER" -- THE FIGHTING, HARASSMENT, AND SABOTAGE ACTIONS THAT THE REBELS HAVE BEEN CARRYING OUT SINCE A GENERAL OFFENSIVE WAS LAUNCHED ON 11 NOVEMBER. THE PRESIDENT MADE IT QUITE CLEAR THAT THE AGREEMENT ON A CEASE-FIRE DOES NOT IMPLY A SURRENDER, ONLY THE CREATION OF AN OPPORTUNITY FOR NEGOTIATIONS WHICH WILL ALLOW THE SEARCH FOR A POLITICAL AGREEMENT BY 15 FEBRUARY 1990. HE ADDED THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS SHOULD ALLOW THE FMLN TO PUT DOWN ITS WEAPONS AND JOIN THE POLITICAL PROCESS IN EL SALVADOR BY THEN. THE TOPIC OF EL SALVADOR, WORSENED BY THE REBEL OFFENSIVE, WILL BE THE MAIN TOPIC AT THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT TO BE HELD IN THE COSTA RICAN CAPITAL ON SUNDAY, 10 DECEMBER.
DEV-MUC3-0955	SAN SALVADOR, 9 DEC 89 -- THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT TODAY OFFERED $250,000 TO WHOEVER HELPS "DISCOVER THE ASSASSINS" OF THE SIX JESUITS RIDDLED WITH BULLETS AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY ON 16 NOVEMBER. THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE BY PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE, IN WHICH HE OFFERED $250,000 TO "THE PERSON OR PERSONS WHO, AGAINST THEIR WILL OR UNWITTINGLY, INDIRECTLY PARTICIPATED IN THE EVENT AND PROVIDES RELEVANT INFORMATION WHICH HELPS SOLVE THE CRIME." THE GOVERNMENT OFFERED WHOEVER PROVIDES INFORMATION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUITS -- FIVE SPANIARDS AND ONE SALVADORAN -- AND A WOMAN AND HER DAUGHTER "THE GUARANTEE THAT THEY AND THEIR FAMILY WILL BE SETTLED AS RESIDENTS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY." THE GOVERNMENT WILL ALSO CARRY OUT THE NECESSARY PROCEDURES "TO GET A PARDON TO EXONERATE OF THE CRIME IN WHICH THEY MAY HAVE INDIRECTLY PARTICIPATED" DURING THE MASS MURDER.
DEV-MUC3-0956	TEGUCIGALPA, 9 DEC 89 -- HONDURAN PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA AND GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO ASKED THEIR CENTRAL AMERICAN COLLEAGUES TODAY "TO END THE FOOLISH AND RIDICULOUS WAR THAT WE ARE IN." ON THE EVE OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT WHICH OPENS IN COSTA RICA ON 10 DECEMBER, AZCONA AND CEREZO WERE BOTH GUESTS AT THE GRADUATION OF 100 AGRONOMISTS FROM THE PAN-AMERICAN SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURE. AT THE SCHOOL 36 KM EAST OF TEGUCIGALPA, CEREZO VOICED THE HOPE THAT THE SUMMIT WILL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE "A POLITICAL SOLUTION THAT WILL PREVENT MORE DESTRUCTION IN CENTRAL AMERICA." "WE ARE LIVING A FUTILE, SENSELESS WAR IN WHICH THE CENTRAL AMERICANS ARE ASSUMING THE ROLE OF BUYERS OF WEAPONS TO KILL ONE ANOTHER," CEREZO SAID. CEREZO UNDERLINED THE HOPE THAT A POLITICAL DECISION WILL EMERGE SO THAT ALL THE SECTORS ASPIRING TO REACH POWER WILL AGREE "TO DO SO THROUGH THE PATH OF VOTES, INSTEAD OF RESORTING TO VIOLENCE." FOR HIS PART, PRESIDENT AZCONA INSISTED THAT THE CONSOLIDATION OF PEACE "IS THE MOST SENSIBLE MEASURE THAT THE PRESIDENTS CAN PROMOTE." AZCONA STRESSED THE NECESSITY OF CREATING THE NECESSARY CONDITIONS TO "APPROVE INTEGRATION PROJECTS THAT WILL PERMIT THE REGION TO FACE COMMON PROBLEMS." THE TWO PRESIDENTS PLAN TO TRAVEL TOGETHER THIS AFTERNOON TO SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, WHERE THE SIXTH CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMIT OPENS TOMORROW.
DEV-MUC3-0957	CLANDESTINE, 6 DEC 89 -- WE CONDEMN GUATEMALAN INTERVENTION IN EL SALVADOR. THE URNG GENERAL COMMAND EXPRESSES ITS STRONG SOLIDARITY AND DEEP ADMIRATION FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THEIR VANGUARD, THE FMLN , WHO WITH GREAT HEROISM AND DETERMINATION ARE WRITING ONE OF THE MOST GLORIOUS PAGES OF ITS HISTORY. WE VIEW WITH PROFOUND INDIGNATION HOW THE OFFICERS OF LA TANDONA AND THE ARENA GOVERNMENT HEADED BY CRISTIANI, IN VIEW OF THEIR INABILITY TO DEFEAT, REPEL, OR CONTAIN THE HEROIC FMLN, HAVE DECIDED TO CONTINUE MASSIVE BOMBINGS AGAINST DEFENSELESS CIVILIANS, SOW DEATH AND DESTRUCTION, AND COMMIT MASSACRES. THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, WHICH ARE DESPERATE DUE TO THE VICTORIOUS ADVANCES OF THE FMLN FORCES -- WHICH HAVE NOT ONLY MAINTAINED, BUT EXPANDED THEIR POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR AND THE REST OF THE TERRITORY OF THAT FRATERNAL COUNTRY -- HAVE LOST CONTROL. WITH VENGEANCE IN THEIR MINDS, THEY HAVE BEGUN TO IMPLEMENT A NUMBER OF CRIMINAL ACTIONS AGAINST ALL THOSE IDENTIFIED WITH THE JUST STRUGGLES OF THE MAJORITY. AT DAWN ON 16 NOVEMBER, SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO HUMBLE WOMEN WHO WORKED FOR THEM WERE BRUTALLY ASSASSINATED. WE SHARE THE GREAT SORROW OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THE COMMUNITY OF JESUIT PRIESTS AND ADD OUR PROTEST TO THOSE OF OTHERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WHO HAVE ALREADY PROTESTED THESE DESPICABLE ASSASSINATIONS. THE URNG GENERAL COMMAND STRONGLY CONDEMNS THIS INCIDENT AND URGES ALL GUATEMALANS AND ALL POLITICAL, SOCIAL, DEMOCRATIC, AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS TO SPEAK OUT IN THE FACE OF THESE GENOCIDAL AND BARBARIC ACTIONS THAT ARE ONLY COMPARABLE TO WHAT THE UNITED STATES DID IN VIETNAM AND THE NAZIS DID IN WORLD WAR II. IN OUR 13 NOVEMBER STATEMENT, WE DENOUNCED THE GUATEMALAN ARMY'S INTERVENTIONIST PLANS AGAINST THAT FRATERNAL COUNTRY. ON 15 NOVEMBER, PRESS AGENCIES REPORTED THAT THE GUATEMALAN ARMY HAD DEPLOYED 126 UNITS OF THE SPECIAL KAIBILES TROOPS, WHO ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR PATHOLOGICAL SAVAGERY. PRESIDENT CEREZO, THE COMMANDER OF THE MILITARY STAFF, AND THE OFFICIAL SPOKESMAN OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMED FORCES HAVE PUBLICLY EXPRESSED THEIR SOLIDARITY WITH CRISTIANI AND THE SALVADORAN ARMY. WE CONDEMN WITH ALL OUR STRENGTH THE GUATEMALAN ARMY'S INTERVENTION AMONG THE GLORIOUS SALVADORAN PEOPLE. WE CALL ON ALL SEGMENTS OF THE GUATEMALAN POPULATION TO EXPRESS THEIR OPPOSITION AGAINST THIS INTERVENTION. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE GUATEMALAN ARMY AND GOVERNMENT PAY DEARLY FOR THEIR AGGRESSION AGAINST THE FRATERNAL SALVADORAN PEOPLE. WE ADVISE THE WORLD THAT EL SALVADOR MIGHT FACE AN EVEN WORSE GENOCIDE THAN THE ONE IT IS CURRENTLY ENDURING. WE ARE SURE THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL DEFEAT ALL THEIR ENEMIES, WIN THIS HISTORIC STRUGGLE, AND ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS. THE BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED WILL BREED NEW LIFE AND WILL UNDOUBTELY LEAD US TO FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY, AND PEACE. GUATEMALA CITY, 17 NOVEMBER 1989 URNG GENERAL COMMAND COMMANDERS ROLANDO MORAN, PABLO MONSANTO, GASPAR ILOM, AND CARLOS GONZALEZ, PGT SECRETARY GENERAL
DEV-MUC3-0958	SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE -- "JUST A FEW WORDS TO EXPLAIN THE CURRENT MILITARY SITUATION. WE BELIEVE THAT STILL, REGRETTABLY, FOLLOWING THE FMLN'S IRRATIONALITY, WE CANNOT RULE OUT A CONTINUATION OF THEIR VIOLENT ACTIONS. WE KNOW THAT AROUND THE CAPITAL THERE ARE STILL GROUPS OF TERRORISTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHERN AREA, IN THE NORTHWEST -- THE SAN SALVADOR VOLCANO-- AND IN THE NORTHEAST, TO THE NORTH OF SOYAPANGO MUNCIPALITY. THE MILITARY, HOWEVER, HAVE TAKEN THE OFFENSIVE IN THESE THREE AREAS WHERE THE FMLN GROUPS HAVE BEEN CHASED. FIGHTING HAS TAKEN PLACE OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS, WITH OVER 100 CASUALTIES INFLICTED UPON THE FMLN IN 3 DAYS. "WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THEY HAVE LEFT WITHIN THE CAPITAL GREAT NUMBERS OF WEAPONS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED. SOME GROUPS ARE IN HIDING, USING CIVILIANS, AND ARE CARRYING OUT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. THEY HAVE BURNED BUSES, GASOLINE STATIONS AND MURDERED DR FRANCISCO JOSE GUERRERO; AND ON 7 DECEMBER, THEY FIRED THREE OR FOUR MORTAR ROUNDS AT RANDOM, FALLING ON PRIVATE HOMES. ONE OF THEM FELL ON THE HOUSE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE PRESIDENT. WE BELIEVE THESE ACTIONS ARE JUST MERE TERRORISM, INDISCRIMINATELY FIRING MORTARS ON THE CAPITAL'S CIVILIANS. "WE BELIEVE THEY HAVE NO FURTHER CAPACITY EXCEPT TO CARRY OUT THESE TERRORIST ACTS TO CREATE CONFUSION AND ANARCHY AMONG THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. THANK GOD, OUR POPULATION IS VERY BRAVE AND HEROIC. WE HAVE BEEN NOTICING WITH PRIDE HOW THE POPULATION HAS BEEN WORKING NORMALLY IN ALL OF SAN SALVADOR, GOING TO THEIR JOBS, WITH BUSINESSES OPENING AND TRYING TO OPERATE NORMALLY. THERE ARE STILL SOME THREATS IN THE CITY OF SAN MIGUEL, WHERE A GROUP OF TERRORISTS ARE CONCENTRATED TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE CITY. HERE, TOO, THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEGUN AN OFFENSIVE AND QUICKLY END ANY IMMINENT DANGER." PRESIDENT CRISTIANI SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION AT THE 10 DECEMBER PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT WILL BE OPEN TO THE POSSIBILITY OF RESTARTING A DIALOGUE WITH THE INSURGENTS ON 20 DECEMBER, IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA, AS LONG AS THE FMLN NO LONGER CARRIES OUT ARMED ACTIONS IN URBAN AREAS, BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND SHOULD CONTINUE ACTIONS ONLY AGAINST MILITARY TARGETS. "AS YOU ALL HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE FOR YOURSELVES, THE GOVERNMENT HAS NEVER BEEN AGAINST CONTINUING THE DIALOGUE PROCESS TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT. IT HAS BEEN THE FMLN THAT UNILATERALLY BROKE THIS DIALOGUE PROCESS BY NOT TURNING UP AT CARACAS, VENEZULA, AS HAD BEEN AGREED IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA. WE, HOWEVER, ARE GOING TO MAKE A DEFINITE PROPOSAL IN COSTA RICA, WHICH IN GENERAL TERMS IS AS FOLLOWS: "THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO RESTART THE DIALOGUE PROCESS. MOST CONVENIENT WOULD BE FOR THIS TO TAKE PLACE IN CARACAS, WITH THE FOLLOWING CONDITION: BEGINING 15 DECEMBER, 3 DAYS AFTER THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL MEETING , THE FMLN SHOULD PUBLICLY DECLARE AND GIVE PROOF OF COMPLIANCE THAT IT WILL END ALL TYPES OF TERRORIST ACTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AFFECT CIVILIANS. WE WANT TO CLARIFY THAT WE ARE NOT ASKING THEM TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS, AS WAS ATTEMPTED MANY TIMES. IF THE FMLN CONTINUES ITS IRRATIONAL BEHAVIOR, THE ARMED FORCES WILL CONTINUE FIGHTING THEM. TERRORIST ACTIONS AGAINST CIVILIANS MUST END. THE PEOPLE DO NOT DESERVE TO CONTINUE BEING THE MOST AFFECTED BY THE IRRATIONALITY OF ALL THIS FIGHTING. WE THINK THE LEAST THE FMLN CAN DO IS TO STOP ALL ACTIONS THAT AFFECT, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. MILITARY TARGETS ARE SOMETHING ELSE; BUT IF WE ANALYZE THINGS, UP TO THIS MOMENT NOT A SINGLE MILITARY OBJECTIVE WAS THE TARGET SINCE 11 NOVEMBER. THEY HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN ABLE TO TAKE OVER A CIVIL DEFENSE POST. ALL ACTIONS HAVE BEEN AGAINST CIVILIANS, TRYING TO INTIMIDATE THEM, TRYING TO CREATE TERROR AMONG THE POPULATION. THE CESSATION OF TERRORIST ACTS SHOULD BE THE FMLN'S PROOF OF SINCERITY AND WILL TO REALLY TRY AND SEEK A SOLUTION BY WAY OF DIALOGUE. IF THE FMLN TODAY ACCEPTS ENDING ALL ACTIONS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION, THEN WE ARE WILLING ON 20 DECEMBER TO GO TO CARACAS AND TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS AND TALKS ON ALL THE TOPICS THE FMLN WISHES TO TALK ABOUT. THJIS WILL BE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT BY 15 FEBRUARY WE HAVE A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT."
DEV-MUC3-0959	SAN SALVADOR, 10 DEC 89 -- MSGR ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS, ARCHBISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, STATED TODAY THAT "THE UNITED STATES SAYS THAT IT WANTS TO HELP IMPROVE THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN EL SALVADOR. HOWEVER, IN THE CASE OF THE INVESTIGATION OF THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS, IT IS OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE." ARCHBISHOP RIVERA Y DAMAS SAID, "I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE PURPOSE OF ASSUMING THIS ATTITUDE IS. HOWEVER, WHEN EYEWITNESS LUCIA BARRERA DE CERNA FIRST TESTIFIED, SHE CLEARLY DESCRIBED THE MEN AS BEING DRESSED AS SOLDIERS AND NOT AS GUERRILLAS. I BELIEVE THAT IT IS EASY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ONE WAY OF DRESSING AND ANOTHER." IT SEEMS THAT THE PLAN IS TO LEAD THE INVESTIGATION THROUGH OTHER PATHS, AND THAT IS WHY THE U.S. OFFICIALS TOOK THE EYEWITNESS TO THE UNITED STATES, "WHERE SHE WAS GIVEN AN AUTHENTIC BRAINWASHING AND THREATENED WITH DEPORTATION IF SHE DID NOT TELL THE TRUTH." ACCORDING TO THE JESUITS' LAWYER, SCOTT GRATHEAD, MRS. CERNA WAS SUBJECTED TO AN "AGGRESSIVE AND VIOLENT" QUESTIONING SESSION. AFTER THIS PSYCHOLOGICAL TORMENT, SHE THOUGHT IT OVER AND RETRACTED HER STATEMENT. FORTUNATELY, ONCE RID OF THE PRESSURE FROM HER "PROTECTORS," SHE HAS RETAKEN THE PATH OF TRUTH. IN HIS HOMILY TODAY, THE ARCHBISHOP DENOUNCED THE UNITED STATES FOR TREATING THE WITNESS DIFFERENTLY ONCE SHE ARRIVED IN THE UNITED STATES, INSTEAD OF PROTECTING HER LIKE THE U.S. EMBASSY OFFICIALS IN SAN SALVADOR HAD PROMISED, KNOWING THAT THE HUMBLE WORKING WOMAN "FREELY AND SINCERELY HAD DECLARED WHAT SHE HAD SEEN AND HEARD THE NIGHT OF THE HORRIBLE MASSACRE." THE JESUIT PRIESTS WERE MURDERED ON THE MORNING OF 16 NOVEMBER. REFERRING TO THE STATEMENT MADE BY THE NATION'S ATTORNEY GENERAL, WHO SAID THAT THE CHURCH HAS REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH THE INVESTIGATION OF THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS -- A LAWYER-PRIEST HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO COOPERATE WITH THE INVESTIGATION -- THE ARCHBISHOP SAID THAT THIS STATEMENT IS NOT ONLY FALSE BUT ALSO MALICIOUS. IN HIS HOMILY TODAY THE PRELATE SAID THAT, IN THE FIRST PLACE, IT THE LAYMEN'S GROUND, AND THAT IS WHERE THEY SHOULD PROVE THEIR EXPERTISE AND MORAL INTEGRITY. THEY SHOULD IMBUE THE EXERCISE OF THEIR PROFESSION WITH EVANGELICAL VALUES. THE ARCHBISHOP SAID THAT, IN THE SECOND PLACE, "IT COULD BE A TRAP." HE ADDED THAT THE CHURCH IS NOT GOING TO ENDORSE WITH A CLERGYMAN'S PRESENCE SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY BEGINNING TO BE "MURKY." THE CHURCH AND OTHER SECTORS LINKED TO THE INVESTIGATION IN AN INDEPENDENT WAY HAVE BEEN DISTRUSTFUL EVER SINCE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE SHOWED ITS ATTITUDE TOWARD LUCIA BARRERA DE CERNA'S TESTIMONY. SHE WAS TESTIFYING AT THE SPANISH EMBASSY BEFORE LAWYERS AND AMBASSADORS, AND AS THE CURFEW HOUR APPROACHED, THEY TOOK THE WITNESS TO ANOTHER EMBASSY. THE NEXT DAY TWO DISTRICT ATTORNEYS CAME TO HARASS THE WITNESS WITH QUESTIONS. THE ARCHBISHOP ONCE AGAIN REJECTED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ACCUSATION. HE REITERATED THE BELIEF THAT THE ARMED FORCES WERE GUILTY OF THE MURDERS. HE SAID, "I AM NOT MAKING ANY ACCUSATIONS. HOWEVER, THE CHURCH IS VERY ANNOYED, AND ALTHOUGH I AM NOT SAYING THAT WE ARE THE OBJECT OF OFFICIAL PERSECUTION, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS REGIME THERE IS PERSECUTION IN OTHER SECTORS."
DEV-MUC3-0960	SAN SALVADOR, 10 DEC 89 -- A SPOKESMAN FOR THE LEFTIST DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE SAID TODAY THAT, IF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS RESTART TALKS ON 20 DECEMBER, THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL OPPOSITION WANTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TALKS "SO THAT THE PEOPLE MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO ATTAINING PEACE." A SOURCE FROM THAT POLITICAL GROUP, WHICH BRINGS TOGETHER TWO SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTIES WITH ONE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PARTY AND IS A MEMBER OF SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL, TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT THESE GROUPS "SUPPORT ALL INITIATIVES FAVORING PEACE." THE SPOKESMAN ADDED THAT "IF A DIALOGUE DOES TAKE PLACE, WE WANT THE PEOPLE, REPRESENTED BY THE POLITICAL PARTIES, TO TAKE PART IN THIS PROCESS THAT EL SALVADOR NEEDS MORE THAN EVER TODAY." THE SPOKESMAN SAID THAT SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S PROPOSAL ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY, IN WHICH HE EXPRESSES HIS WILLINGNESS TO RESTART THE DIALOGUE IF THE GUERRILLAS STOP "THEIR TERRORIST ACTIONS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION" BY 15 DECEMBER, IS "FEASIBLE AS LONG AS THERE IS A SINCERE WILL." CRISTIANI'S PROPOSAL TO THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT WILL BE REVEALED TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS DURING THEIR SIXTH SUMMIT IN COSTA RICA TODAY. THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT EXPECTS TO RECEIVE HIS COLLEAGUES' POLITICAL SUPPORT. THE CD BELIEVES THAT CRISTIANI "DOES NOT WANT TO APPEAR WARMONGERING OR DEFIANT IN COSTA RICA, AND WILL BRING TO SAN JOSE A MORE MARKETABLE PROPOSAL THAT HAS POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ASPECTS." "THE DIALOGUE THAT HE PROPOSES IS FEASIBLE AND REASONABLE, BUT THE PEOPLE MUST BE INVOLVED IN IT," THE SOURCE POINTED OUT. HE ADDED THAT THE "NEGATIVE" ASPECT OF THE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSAL IS THAT "IT FAILS TO MENTION THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE ARREST AND PERSECUTION OF POLITICAL LEADERS, AND THE STATE OF SIEGE IN FORCE SINCE 12 NOVEMBER." THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR HAS WORSENED SINCE 11 NOVEMBER, WHEN THE GUERRILLAS LAUNCHED THEIR LARGEST OFFENSIVE IN 10 YEARS OF FIGHTING. CRISTIANI BELIEVES THAT IF THE FMLN SUSPENDS ITS HOSTILITIES AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION THE DIALOGUE COULD BE RESUMED ON 20 DECEMBER IN CARACAS AND "THERE WOULD BE A SOLUTION TO THE ARMED CONFLICT" IN THIS COUNTRY ON 20 FEBRUARY 1990. THE GUERRILLAS HAVE NOT YET REPLIED TO THE PROPOSAL OF CRISTIANI, WHO GAVE ASSURANCES THAT THE REBELS ARE "NOT BEING ASKED TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS." IN FACT, CRISTIANI NOTED THAT HE WOULD MAINTAIN HIS WILLINGNESS TO TAKE PART IN A "DIALOGUE" EVEN IF THE GUERRILLAS ATTACK POSITIONS THAT ARE "STRICTLY MILITARY. OUR SOLE CONDITION IS THAT THEY SUSPEND TERRORIST ACTIONS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION." THE WAR THAT BEGAN 10 YEARS AGO IN EL SALVADOR HAS LEFT MORE THAN 70,000 DEAD.
DEV-MUC3-0961	MANAGUA , 10 DEC 89 -- I CAME BECAUSE I WAS TOLD THAT OUR REPORTER FRIENDS WERE GREATLY INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHAT IS HAPPENING. I UNDERSTAND THAT ATTITUDE BECAUSE I WORKED AS A NEWSMAN FOR MANY YEARS. I ALSO UNDERSTAND YOUR NEED TO TRANSMIT INFORMATION TO OUR CENTRAL AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHO ARE SO INTERESTED IN THE SUCCESS OF THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS' SUMMIT, AND TO THE REST OF THE INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC, WHO ARE INTERESTED THAT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE TOWARD A FINAL PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA. YESTERDAY EVENING, THE FOREIGN MINISTERS AGREED NOT TO SPEAK TO THE PRESS INDIVIDUALLY. WE APPOINTED COSTA RICAN FOREIGN MINISTER RODRIGO MADRIGAL NIETO AS OUR SPOKESMAN. HE SAID WHAT WE HAD AGREED TO SAY AT THAT TIME. IN FACT, THERE IS NOT MUCH MORE TO REPORT NOW. FOREIGN MINISTER MADRIGAL NIETO TOLD YOU YESTERDAY THAT THE FOREIGN MINISTERS HAD BASICALLY DEVOTED THEIR TIME TO EXAMINING THREE TOPICS. WE ALSO HAD TWO MORE TOPICS, BUT IN ALL THERE WERE THREE TOPICS. I THINK HE MENTIONED THE CONTRAS' DEMOBILIZATION, THE INTERNAL SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR, AND A THIRD TOPIC, BUT RIGHT NOW I DO NOT DARE TO SAY WHAT IT WAS LEST I MAKE A MISTAKE. HE MENTIONED ONUCA . THAT IS CORRECT. IN FACT, WE DISCUSSED FIVE TOPICS, BUT IF HE SAID... ONUCA WAS ONE OF THEM. SO WE HAVE DEMOBILIZATION, THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR, AND ONUCA. THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS DEVOTED THEIR TIME TO THESE THREE TOPICS. THIS WAS NOT SO EASY. SOME SAY THE THING TO DO IS TO CLEARLY AND CATEGORICALLY CONDEMN THE FMLN FOR... AND TO DESCRIBE IT AS A TERRORIST GROUP. OTHERS SAY: LET US CONDEMN TERRORISM IN GENERAL, AND ALSO ANYONE WHO USES IT. SOME ATTACH A GREAT DEAL OF IMPORTANCE TO WHAT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SPECIALIZING IN DEFENDING AND PROMOTING RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS SAY, NAMELY ORGANIZATIONS LIKE AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, AMERICA'S WATCH, THE GENEVA-BASED INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE OF JURISTS, THE OAS' INTER-AMERICAN COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RIGHTS, THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, THE UN'S TASK FORCE ON FORCED DISAPPEARANCES, AND THE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS CATHOLIC INSTITUTE IN LONDON, ENGLAND. ALL THESE ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY FROM THE NICARAGUAN STANDPOINT DESERVE RESPECT AND CREDIBILITY, INDICATE MATTERS ARE NOT SIMPLY BLACK AND WHITE.
DEV-MUC3-0962	SAN JOSE , 10 DEC 89 -- SALVADORAN DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL RAFAEL LARIOS TODAY REJECTED THE CHRISTMAS TRUCE PROPOSED BY SOME COUNTRIES AT THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT AND DEMANDED THAT THE GUERRILLAS END HOSTILITIES AS A PRIOR CONDITION FOR THE DIALOGUE TO BE RESUMED. THE MINISTER, WHO ALWAYS LABELED THE REBELS "TERRORISTS," SAID THAT THIS "IS NOT THE TIME FOR TRUCES, BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY DO NOT WORK." COSTA RICA PROPOSED A "CHRISTMAS TRUCE" TODAY BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN ARMY AND GUERRILLAS TO ALLEVIATE THE EXISTING TENSION IN THE AREA IN THE WAKE OF THE HEIGHTENED FIGHTING IN EL SALVADOR, WHICH HAS LEFT 2,000 DEAD IN THE PAST MONTH. LARIOS, HOWEVER, AGREED THAT THE DIALOGUE "CAN BEGIN" WITHOUT THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT TURNING OVER ITS WEAPONS BEFOREHAND. "THE GUERRILLAS DO NOT NECESSARILY HAVE TO TURN OVER THEIR WEAPONS FOR THE DIALOGUE TO BEGIN," LARIOS STATED. THE SALVADORAN GENERAL DENIED THAT THE FMLN CAN ESTABLISH ITSELF IN CERTAIN "TERRITORIES" WHILE THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE HELD. "THE FMLN TERRORISTS ARE NOT IN ANY SPECIFIC PLACE," LARIOS STATED, AND THEN NOTED THAT THE GUERRILLAS WILL RECEIVE "GUARANTEES" FOR THEIR SAFETY IF THEY END HOSTILITIES AND BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS "TO REJOIN POLITICAL LIFE." LARIOS REJECTED THE FMLN CHARGES AGAINST RANKING MILITARY OFFICERS, WHO IT ACCUSED OF MASTERMINDING THE KILLING OF THE SIX JESUITS, FIVE OF WHOM WERE SPANIARDS, AND TWO WOMEN.
DEV-MUC3-0963	GUATEMALA CITY , 11 DEC 89 -- THE POLICE REPORTED TODAY THAT MARCO TULIO MONTENEGRO, ONE OF THE THREE TOP LEADERS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS HAS BEEN FOUND DEAD IN GUATEMALA CITY. THE AUTHORITIES REPORT THAT THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW MONTENEGRO DIED. HIS BODY WAS FOUND ON SATURDAY UNDER A BRIDGE IN THIS CAPITAL, BUT THE FACT WAS NOT REPORTED UNTIL TODAY. MONTENEGRO'S RELATIVES SAID THAT HE HAD "BRUISES ON HIS FACE, MARKS INDICATING BLOWS ON HIS LEFT ARM AND ABDOMEN, AND A STAB WOUND." THE AEU LEADER HAD CONSTANTLY BEEN RECEIVING ANONYMOUS DEATH THREATS FOLLOWING THE KIDNAPPING AND KILLING OF SEVERAL OF HIS COMRADES OVER 3 MONTHS AGO. MONTENEGRO HAD RETURNED A SHORT TIME AGO FROM PANAMA, WHERE HE TOOK REFUGE BECAUSE OF THE DEATH THREATS.
DEV-MUC3-0964	SAN SALVADOR, 11 DEC 89 -- MILITARY AUTHORITIES HAVE REPORTED THAT, FOR THE THIRD DAY IN A ROW, STRONG BATTLES ARE BEING WAGED IN TONACATEPEQUE, APPROXIMATELY 14 KM NORTHEAST OF SAN SALVADOR. THE REBELS, THROUGH THEIR CLANDESTINE RADIO STATIONS, HAVE CONFIRMED THESE REPORTS ADDING THAT THE BATTLES ARE BEING WAGED AGAINST SALVADORAN AIR FORCE TROOPS BECAUSE THIS AREA IS CONSIDERED AN AIR FORCE "SECURITY ZONE." CLASHES WERE ALSO REPORTED IN SANTIAGO AND SAN JUAN NONUALCO, LA PAZ DEPARTMENT, 28 OR 30 KM SOUTHEAST OF SAN SALVADOR. MEANWHILE, IN SAN SALVADOR, LARGE AREAS OF THE CITY WERE WITHOUT ELECTRICITY THIS MORNING BECAUSE OF THE RATIONING IMPOSED TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THIS WEEKEND'S SABOTAGE ACTIONS. YESTERDAY AFTERNOON THE RESIDENTS OF SAN SALVADOR, ESPECIALLY IN THE WESTERN SECTOR OF THE CITY, WERE ALARMED WHEN THEY HEARD APPROXIMATELY 50 EXPLOSIONS. MILITARY SOURCES LATER EXPLAINED THAT SOLDIERS WERE SHELLING REBEL POSITIONS IN THE SAN SALVADOR VOLCANO AREA.
DEV-MUC3-0965	SAN SALVADOR, 11 DEC 89 -- THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS SUFFERED 29 CASUALTIES, INCLUDING DEAD AND WOUNDED, DURING CLASHES WITH THE ARMY OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. A MILITARY SPOKESMAN GAVE ASSURANCES THAT FIVE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT REBELS WERE KILLED ON THE NIGHT OF 10 DECEMBER ALONG THE NORTHERN PERIPHERY OF THE EASTERN CITY OF SAN MIGUEL, 130 KM FROM SAN SALVADOR, IN CLASHES WITH 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE TROOPS.

ANOTHER INSURGENT WAS KILLED IN NUEVO CUSCATLAN, IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR, WHERE FMLN FIGHTERS CLASHED WITH TROOPS FROM THE PARATROOPER BATTALION, THE SPOKEKSMAN ADDED. THE OFFICIAL REPORT DID NOT INDICATE ARMY CASUALTIES IN THE CLASHES REPORTED OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS. FROM 2300 ON 10 DECEMBER UNTIL 0200 TODAY, THE GUERRILLAS ALSO ATTACKED CIVIL DEFENSE MILITARY POSITIONS IN TONACATEPEQUE, 16 KM NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR, WHERE THEY KILLED TWO CIVIL DEFENSE MEMBERS.

MEANWHILE, CLANDESTINE RADIO VENCEREMOS, THE FMLN'S OFFICIAL VOICE, REPORTED THAT OVER THE WEEKEND THE REBELS KILLED 1 SOLDIER AND SERIOUSLY WOUNDED 11, AMONG THEM A TREASURY POLICE OFFICER. THE SOLDIER DIED IN A CLASH IN TEJUTEPEQUE, IN THE NORTHERN CABANAS DEPARTMENT, THE REBEL STATION ADDED, WITHOUT REPORTING THE FMLN'S CASUALTIES. THE GUERRILLAS CLAIM, MOREOVER, TO HAVE DESTROYED SIX PRIMARY POWER TRANSMISSION TOWERS BETWEEN THE "CERRON GRANDE" AND "15 DE SEPTIEMBRE" POWER PLANTS, IN THE NORTHERN AND EASTERN PARTS OF SAN SALVADOR. SPOKESMEN FOR THE LEMPA RIVER HYDROELECTRIC EXECUTIVE COMMISSION CONFIRMED THE DESTRUCTION OF THE POWER LINES TO ACAN-EFE, ADDING THAT, THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, NINE POWER SYSTEM STRUCTURES WERE DAMAGED OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS. THE COUNTRY'S POWER DEFICIT IS 35 PERCENT.

THE PERSONNEL AT THE ENEMY BASE HAD BEEN PERSECUTING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AND HAD CAPTURED THREE RESIDENTS WHO WERE RELEASED BY OUR FORCES WHEN THEY OPENED THE DOORS TO THE JAIL WHERE THE PRISONERS WER BEING HELD. AFTER SEIZING CONTROL OF THE TOWN, OUR FORCES TOTALLY DESTROYED THE GARRISON AND LOCAL COMMAND POST. THEY ALSO PARTIALLY DESTROYED THE MAYOR'S OFFICE AND THE ANTEL INSTALLATIONS. THIS HAS BEEN A REPORT FROM TONACATEPEQUE. THE STRATEGIC SIEGE OF SAN SALVADOR HAS BEEN EXPANDED WITH THIS NEW ACTION -- THE SEIZURE OF TONACATEPEQUE, WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT POSITION IN THE DEFENSE RING OF ILOPANGO AIR FORCE BASE, LOCATED 7 KM SOUTH OF THE CITY.
DEV-MUC3-0967	TEGUCIGALPA, 11 DEC 89 -- HONDURAS' RADIO AMERICA REPORTED TODAY THAT A SANDINIST HELICOPTER HAS ATTACKED AND SUNK A HONDURAN FISHING BOAT IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN. SO FAR, 14 SURVIVORS HAVE BEEN RESCUED, BUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE KILLED AND INJURED IN THE INCIDENT IS STILL NOT KNOWN, ACCORDING TO THE RADIO STATION. RADIO AMERICA CITED AS ITS SOURCE COLONEL RAFAEL CASTRO ARISTA, PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA HOYO'S CHIEF OF SECURITY, WHO IS IN SAN JOSE ACCOMPANYING THE PRESIDENT AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMIT MEETING.
DEV-MUC3-0968	SAN JOSE , 11 DEC 89 -- NICARAGUAN INFORMATION MINISTER MANUEL ESPINOZA TODAY EMPHATICALLY DENIED A HONDURAN RADIO STATION'S REPORT THAT A HONDURAN FISHING BOAT WAS ATTACKED BY A SANDINIST ARMY HELICOPTER. ACCORDING TO TEGUCIGALPA'S RADIO AMERICA, THE ALLEGED INCIDENT OCCURRED ON THE ATLANTIC, OFF BLUEFIELDS, AND REPORTEDLY LEFT AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF DEAD AND WOUNDED. ESPINOZA SAID IN COSTA RICA, WHERE HE IS ACCOMPANYING PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMIT, THAT "THE REPORT ON THE ATTACK WAS RELEASED WITH THE INTENTION OF INTERFERING IN THE MEETING OF THE REGION'S PRESIDENTS." THE TRUTH IS, ESPINOZA SAID, THAT LAST WEEK A HONDURAN FISHING BOAT WAS SEIZED ON THE ATLANTIC BECAUSE IT WAS FISHING IN NICARAGUAN WATERS, AND THE CREW SUBSEQUENTLY MUTINIED AND KILLED A SANDINIST SOLDIER. THE MINISTER SAID THAT "NO INCIDENT OCCURRED TODAY." HONDURAN AUTHORITIES REPORTED TODAY THAT 36 PEOPLE ARE MISSING AND 14 SURVIVED THE ATTACK ON THE FISHING BOAT. THEY SAID THE SURVIVORS HAVE BEEN RESCUED.
DEV-MUC3-0969	MANAGUA, 20 MAR 89 -- THE MURDER OF THREE JOURNALISTS IN EL SALVADOR YESTERDAY ONCE AGAIN SHOWS THE REPRESSIVE AND CRIMINAL NATURE OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY. THOSE ACTIONS AGAINST OUR PRESS COLLEAGUES ARE ONLY COMPARABLE WITH ACTIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE ARMIES IN CHILE, PARAGUAY, AND OTHER MILITARY DICTATORSHIPS. THE SOMOZIST ARMY COMMITTED SIMILAR CRIMES IN NICARAGUA. WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE COLD WAY IN WHICH U.S. JOURNALIST BILL STEWART WAS KILLED WHILE COVERING THE LAST PHASE OF THE INSURRECTION IN MANAGUA'S WESTERN NEIGHBORHOODS. IN EL SALVADOR, FOREIGN AND NATIONAL JOURNALISTS ARE DEMANDING A SERIOUS INVESTIGATION FROM PRESIDENT DUARTE'S GOVERNMENT TO PUNISH THE MILITARY MEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIME. WILL THE ARMY'S HIGH COMMAND BE WILLING TO CONDUCT THE INVESTIGATION? WE DOUBT IT, BASED ON ITS LACK OF WILLINGNESS TO RECTIFY THINGS IN THE PAST REGARDING OTHER CASES, SUCH AS THE ASSASSINATION OF MSGR ROMERO AND THE MURDER OF HERBERT ANAYA, PRESIDENT OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION. AFTER ALL, THAT IS THE WAY IN WHICH NAPOLEON DUARTE'S CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT RESTRAINS FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IN HIS COUNTRY. MORE THAN 11 JOURNALISTS HAVE BEEN KILLED BY THE SALVADORAN ARMY SINCE 1981. MEANWHILE, IN NICARAGUA, JOURNALISTS FROM INDEPENDENT MEDIA ARE CONCERNED ABOUT 39 FORMER SOMOZIST GUARDS WHO ARE STILL IN JAIL BECAUSE OF THEIR CRIMINAL RECORDS, TO THE POINT OF LAUNCHING JOURNALISTIC CAMPAIGNS DEMANDING FROM THE GOVERNMENT THE RELEASE OF THE HARMLESS PIGEONS. WHAT WILL THEY SAY NOW ABOUT THE SALVADORAN ARMY, WHICH MURDERED THEIR COLLEAGUES WHO WERE COMPLYING WITH THEIR DUTY TO INFORM THE PUBLIC? WILL THEY DEFEND THEM AS THEY DEFENDED THE SOMOZIST GUARDS? THEY PROBABLY WILL. THEY WILL TRY TO PLAY DOWN THE ACTION, BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOST THEIR DIGNITY, GOOD SENSE, AND PROFESSIONAL PRIDE A LONG TIME AGO.
DEV-MUC3-0970	MANAGUA , 11 DEC 89 -- I THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PRESENCE HERE. THIS MORNING WE RECEIVED REPORTS THAT THE SANDINIST PEOPLE'S ARMY HAD BOMBED AND SANK SEVERAL HONDURAN BOATS. WE MEAN CIVILIAN FISHING BOATS. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED. WE HAVE VERY FEW PATROL BOATS ON THE ATLANTIC COAST AND OUR BOATS THERE ARE IN CHARGE OF PROTECTING NICARAGUA'S SOVEREIGNTY AND WEALTH. FOR MANY YEARS, THE NICARAGUAN AIR FORCE AND THE SANDINIST NAVY HAVE BEEN CONDUCTING JOINT OPERATIONS. IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE CONDUCTED SUCH OPERATIONS. FURTHERMORE, WE HAVE TAPED MOST OF THOSE OPERATIONS BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE THOROUGH TRAINING AND ACCURACY. DURING THOSE OPERATIONS, HELICOPTERS HAVE DEPLOYED MEN WHO BOARD MOST OF THE SHIPS PARTICIPATING IN THE OPERATIONS. IN OTHER WORDS, HELICOPTERS FOLLOW THE SHIPS AS THEY MOVE ALONG AND THEN SPECIAL SANDINIST NAVY FORCES BOARD THE SHIP FROM THE AIR. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED MORE OR LESS. ON 7 DECEMBER 1989 WE CONDUCTED AN OPERATION, BASICALLY BECAUSE SINCE NOVEMBER, WE HAVE DETECTED OVER 30 PIRATE SHIPS, IN OTHER WORDS, SHIPS THAT HAVE NEITHER LICENSE NOR PERMIT TO FISH IN NICARAGUAN TERRITORIAL WATERS. DURING AN OPERATION OF THE TYPE I JUST DESCRIBED, OUR FORCES BOARDED THREE BOATS AT 1020 ON 7 DECEMBER. THE OPERATION WAS CARRIED OUT APPROXIMATELY 45 MILES EAST OF PUERTO CABEZAS. IN OTHER WORDS, THE THREE BOATS WERE BOARDED IN THIS AREA HERE. . THE NAMES OF THE BOATS ARE "KERRY MAC II", "DAVIS JR," "MISS PATSY," AND ANOTHER ONE CALLED "TIE WATER" . THE BOATS WERE CAPTURED AND TAKEN TO ISLA DEL MAIZ. IN EACH BOAT THERE WERE FIVE NICARAGUAN SOLDIERS, ONE AIR FORCE OFFICER, AND ONE NAVY OFFICER. AS THE BOATS WERE TAKEN TO ISLA DEL MAIZ, THE MEMBERS OF THE "MISS PATSY" CREW, WHO NUMBERED APPROXIMATELY 60, MUTINIED AGAINST THE SANDINIST OFFICERS ON BOARD. THE SHIP'S CAPTAIN AND A COOK DISARMED ONE OF THE SOLDIERS AND KILLED HIM. AS A RESULT OF THE CONFRONTATION, THE COOK WAS KILLED, BUT THE CAPTAIN WAS UNHARMED. AFTER THE MUTINY WAS OVER, AND AT APPROXIMATELY 0.7 MILES FROM CORN, I MEAN ISLA DEL MAIZ, THE SHIP'S CAPTAIN RAN THE "MISS PATSY" FISHING BOAT AGROUND ON SOME REEF NEAR ISLA DEL MAIZ GRANDE AND WE WERE FORCED TO, LET US SAY, SAVE ALL THE PEOPLE ON BOARD AND TAKE THEM TO CORN ISLAND. ONE OF THE "MISS PATSY" SAILORS JUMPED OFF THE SHIP AND WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND HIM. OF THE TWO BODIES, THAT OF THE ARMY OFFICER AND THE COOK, WE HAVE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO RECOVER THE COOK'S BODY BECAUSE THE SHIP SANK. MOST OF THE OTHER PEOPLE WERE TAKEN TO HOSPITALS IN BLUEFIELDS AND OTHERS ARE BEING HELD BY THE SANDINIST NAVY. THAT IS MORE OR LESS WHAT HAPPENED. WHEN THE "MISS PATSY" RAN AGROUND, THE CREW MEMBERS OF THE OTHER SHIPS CAME TO HELP, AND DURING THIS TIME, APPARENTLY, THE SHIP CALLED "DAVIS JR" MANAGED TO ESCAPE. WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND IT, BUT WE WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THE FOLLOWING EPS OFFICERS ARE ON THAT BOAT: AIR FORCE FIRST LIEUTENANT VICTOR RODRIGUEZ HERNANDEZ, LT JUAN CARLOS GALO TINOCO, NAVY SAILOR JOSE MARCELINO REYES, AND SAILOR JOSE RENE RODRIGUEZ. WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE "DAVIS JR," BUT WE BELIEVE IT RETURNED TO HONDURAS. THAT IS MORE OR LESS WHAT HAPPENED. I AM NOW READY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY WANT TO ASK.
DEV-MUC3-0971	CLANDESTINE, 12 DEC 89 -- THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT , WITH REGARD TO THE RESULTS OF THE EXTRAORDINARY MEETING OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, REPORTS THE FOLLOWING: 1. THE RESULTS OF THE PRESIDENTS' MEETING HAS ALLOWED US TO MEASURE THE DEPTH OF THE CRISIS IN EL SALVADOR AND THE IMPACT OF THE FMLN'S CURRENT MILITARY OFFENSIVE, INASMUCH AS THE SUMMIT'S ENTIRE EFFORT WAS AIMED AT SAVING THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT FROM AN EXTREME POLITICAL AND MILITARY CRISIS AND FROM INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION IN EXCHANGE FOR A NEW PROMISE ON THE IMMEDIATE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS. 2. THE FMLN INDIGNANTLY REJECTS THE PRESIDENTS' DECLARATION BECAUSE, CONTRARY TO THE DYNAMICS OF THE ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THE CLAMOR OF DEMOCRATIC AND SOCIAL FORCES, AND THE CLAMOR OF CHURCHES IN THE COUNTRY, THIS DECLARATION UNCONDITIONALLY SUPPORTS THE LEADING VIOLATOR OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE REGION, A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS MURDERED AND PERSECUTED THE CLERGY AND BOMBED THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. THIS SUPPORT ENCOURAGES THOSE WHO HAVE UNLEASHED THAT IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE AND ALLOWS MORE MURDERS IN EL SALVADOR. 3. THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE TOWARD A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION IN EL SALVADOR. THE FMLN CANNOT BE DISBANDED AS THE RESULT OF AGREEMENTS BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE THE FMLN CONSTITUTES A GENUINELY POPULAR POWER THROUGHOUT THE SALVADORAN TERRITORY, A FORCE THAT THE HUGE U.S.-FINANCED WAR MACHINE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO STOP IN 10 YEARS. 4. AS HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID IN PRIVATE, THE FMLN AGREES WITH UN SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ' MEDIATION TO INITIATE SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL OF THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES. 5. WE ARE HEREBY CALLING FOR INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY SO OTHER COUNTRIES CAN MOBILIZE IMMEDIATELY TO DEFEND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WHO ARE IN DANGER OF SUFFERING FROM AN ESCALATION IN EFFORTS TO EXTERMINATE IT BECAUSE THE FASCIST POLICY HAS BEEN REINFORCED BY THE SUPPORT THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS' DECLARATION OFFERS TO CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT. EL SALVADOR, 12 DECEMBER 1989. FMLN GENERAL COMMAND COMMANDERS JOAQUIAN VILLALOBOS, FRANCISCO JOVEL, EDUARDO SANCHO, JORGE SHAFIK HANDAL, SALVADOR SANCHEZ CEREN
DEV-MUC3-0972	SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE -- IN THE CASE OF EL SALVADOR, THIS IS NOT A MATTER OF THE IRREGULAR GROUP BEING AROUND SAN SALVADOR, IN GUASAPA, OR IN CHALATENANGO -- WHEREVER THEY MAY WANT TO OPERATE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE DEMOBILIZATION PROCESS IS APPLICABLE IF THE GROUP CEASES TO BE AN IRREGULAR GROUP, SOMETHING THAT NO LONGER HAS ANY JUSTIFICATION, TO BECOME A POLITICAL OR A CIVIC GROUP IN THE FRAMEWORK OF A LEGAL PROCESS. THE MESSAGE HERE IS THAT THE PRESIDENTS NO LONGER WANT OR JUSTIFY IRREGULAR GROUPS IN THE REGION, AND IRREGULAR GROUPS HAVE NO REASON FOR CONTINUING IN THE REGION. THIS INCLUDES THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE, THE FMLN, AND OTHER GROUPS, SUCH AS THOSE THAT MAY EXIST IN GUATEMALA. IF GUATEMALA WERE TO ASK THAT A PROBLEM IN THAT SISTER COUNTRY BE CONSIDERED, WE WOULD HAVE TO CONSIDER IT BECAUSE IT IS THE SAME SITUATION. SUPPORT AND VERIFICATION BY THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE OAS IS REQUESTED THROUGH AN ORGANIZATION KNOWN AS CIAV. THE FIRST THING TO DO IS TO CEASE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, TO INITIATE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS, AND THEN TO BE DEMOBILIZED AND TO BECOME A LEGAL GROUP THAT WOULD FUNCTION IN THE FRAMEWORK OF SALVADORAN LAWS. MARIA DOLORES ARGUIAQ, FROM RADIO NACIONAL, SPAIN. CONTINUING WITH THE NICARAGUA PARALLELISM, IS THERE THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A CEASE-FIRE BEFORE OR AFTER THE VENEZUELA MEETING AS A FIRST STEP TOWARD OTHER MEASURES THAT COULD PUT AN END TO THE WAR? MY OTHER QUESTION IS: THE UNITED NATIONS HAS BEEN EXPLICITLY ASKED TO PREPARE THE REINITIATION OF THE DIALOGUE. HAS THERE BEEN ANY PREPARATION? HAS THE CHURCH MADE ANY PREPARATIONS IN THIS REGARD? WELL, THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. AN END OF HOSTILITIES IS BASICALLY LIKE SAYING: DO NOT CARRY OUT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. IT IS BETTER TO DEFINE MEANINGS AND NOT TO USE TERMS THAT CREATE PROBLEMS OF SEMANTICS. WHAT IS YOUR SECOND QUESTION? LOGICALLY. SOMEBODY ELSE HAS ASKED ME ALSO IF WE HAVE HAD ANY CONTACT WITH THE FMLN. THIS AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED AT 0400. AT 0700 WE GOT ON A PLANE AND HERE WE ARE NOW. WE HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO SPEAK WITH MR PEREZ DE CUELLAR, MUCH LESS WITH THE FMLN. BUT THIS INFORMATION WILL BE PASSED TO THE UNITED NATIONS BECAUSE THERE IS MUCH TO BE ASKED OF THE UNITED NATIONS. WE HAVE BEEN CONFRONTED WITH THE PLEASANT SURPRISE THAT REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UN OBSERVER GROUP IN CENTRAL AMERICA ARE ALREADY IN THE COUNTRY, TO BE INSTALLED. MR ORTEGA, WHO HAD GONE THERE WITH THE POSITION THAT AS LONG AS THE RESISTANCE IS NOT DEMOBILIZED HE WOULD NOT ACCEPT ONUCA, HAD TO ABANDON THAT POSITION BECAUSE IT WAS IRRATIONAL, AND ONUCA WILL BE ASKED TO GO TO NICARAGUA IMMEDIATELY. THE AGREEMENT WILL BE REPORTED TO MR JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR. HE WILL ALSO RECEIVE FROM EL SALVADOR A REQUEST THAT HE WORK IN FAVOR OF REINITIATING THE DIALOGUE PROCESS. THE AGREEMENT HAS SPECIAL CONTENTS. IT DOES NOT MENTION OTHER COUNTRIES BY NAME BECAUSE THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS HAVE TRIED TO PRODUCE A DOCUMENT THAT IS VERY RESPECTFUL OF COUNTRIES FROM OUTSIDE THIS AREA, BUT IT IS UNDENIABLE THAT THERE ARE STATES THAT ARE NEGATIVELY AFFECTING THE SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA. THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL, ESPECIALLY AND PERSONALLY, ARE BEING ASKED TO HELP MAKE STATES THAT MEDDLE IN THE REGION SEE THAT THEY MUST HELP THE PEACE PROCESS PROMOTED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS. OBVIOUSLY I DO NOT HAVE TO MENTION THE NAMES OF THE COUNTRIES TO WHICH I AM REFERRING. IT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE TRYING TO FIND A REAL SOLUTION, TO SEE THAT ALL THE FACTORS THAT HAVE BEEN EXERTING INFLUENCE, WHETHER NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE, WORK IN A POSITIVE WAY. THE UNITED NATIONS, WHICH COMPRISES ALL THESE STATES, IS IN A BETTER POSITION TO CARRY OUT THIS WORK.
DEV-MUC3-0973	SAN SALVADOR, 12 DEC 89 -- ON RETURNING TODAY FROM THE CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMIT HELD IN COSTA RICA, SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI SAID THAT "THE TERRORIST ACTIONS OF THE GUERRILLAS ARE NO LONGER JUSTIFIED FROM ANY POINT OF VIEW." PLEASED WITH THE POLITICAL SUPPORT HE OBTAINED FROM HIS COLLEAGUES INCLUDING NICARAGUA'S DANIEL ORTEGA, CRISTIANI SAID IN A NEWS CONFERENCE THAT HE WILL IMMEDIATELY RESUME THE DIALOGUE WITH THE GUERRILLAS "AS SOON AS THE GUERRILLAS CEASE HOSTILITIES AND PUBLICLY GIVE UP COMMITTING VIOLENT ACTIONS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION." THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT SAID THAT "IN THE SUMMIT THERE WAS A SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN THAT THE PRESIDENTS CALLED THE GUERRILLAS BY THEIR NAMES." CRISTIANI FEELS THAT THE "TERRORIST ACTIONS" OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT ARE NOT JUSTIFIED, AND THAT THE GUERRILLAS "ARE PART OF AN INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENT THAT IS ONLY CAPABLE OF GENERATING TERRORISM." IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE, THE GUERRILLAS COULD NOT SURVIVE, HE ADDED. BEFORE CRISTIANI HAD FINISHED HIS NEWS CONFERENCE, THE FMLN "ANGRILY" REACTED WHEN IT LEARNED OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE PRESIDENTS IN COSTA RICA WHO ASKED FOR THEIR "DEMOBILIZATION." THE PRESIDENTS ALSO ASKED THE FMLN TO "PUBLICLY GIVE UP COMMITTING VIOLENT ACTIONS THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AFFECT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION," AND TO "REJOIN THE DIALOGUE PROCESS" THAT WAS SUSPENDED 2 MONTHS AGO. THE GUERRILLAS ACCUSE THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT OF BEING "THE MAIN VIOLATOR OF HUMAN RIGHTS" AND STATED THAT THE COSTA RICA AGREEMENT "ACTUALLY ENCOURAGES THOSE WHO HAVE UNLEASHED THIS IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE AND IT ALLOWS FOR AN EVEN GREATER SLAUGHTER IN EL SALVADOR." POLICE SOURCES CONSULTED BY ACAN - EFE AGREED THAT THE UNITED NATIONS SHOULD NOW ASSUME A "GREATER RESPONSIBILITY" AND SEEK A SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN ARMED CONFLICT THAT HAS LEFT OVER 70,000 DEAD IN 10 YEARS OF WAR IN THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY.
DEV-MUC3-0974	SAN SALVADOR, 12 DEC 89 -- ... HE WAS FACING A FACT HE COULD NO LONGER HIDE: HE IS THE ONE WHO IS SPREADING ARMED REVOLUTIONS IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND TRYING TO HAMPER DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES IN THE REGION. ONCE MORE HE HAS BEEN CAUGHT NOT HONORING THE COMMITMENTS AGREED ON IN TELA, BUT RATHER VIOLATING THESE COMMITMENTS. ON THIS OCCASION HE HAS BEEN LEFT WITH NO POSSIBLE DEFENSE. THEREFORE, IN OUR OPINION, HE HAS NO OPTION OTHER THAN TO ACCEPT THE REALITY OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CENTRAL AMERICA, OR SEE HIMSELF TOTALLY ISOLATED AMID A PEACE PLAN THAT HAS INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT. THIS SITUATION WOULD CAUSE HIM MANY PROBLEMS AND HEADACHES IN POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC MATTERS. HE COULD DO NOTHING BUT ACCEPT THE REALITY. HE COULD NO LONGER DEFEND THE POSITION THAT THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL AND THE FMLN WAS SOMETHING ELSE AND WAS JUSTIFIABLE. IT IS NOW CLEAR THAT HE HAS RUN OUT OF TRICKS AND HAS HAD TO ACCEPT WHAT ALL THE REMAINING FOUR CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ARE AWARE OF AND DEFENDED AT THE COSTA RICAN SUMMIT. NOW, IF IN THEIR STRATEGY THEY SOLD OUT THE FMLN, AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED HERE, THEY WILL HAVE TO GIVE SOME EXPLANATIONS TO THEIR FMLN FRIENDS. THAT IS A PROBLEM BETWEEN HIM AND THE FMLN. WHAT SHOULD BE OF INTEREST TO US IS THAT THE FMLN'S VIOLENT AND TERRORIST ACTIONS ARE NO LONGER JUSTIFIED FROM ANY POINT OF VIEW. THIS HAS BEEN CLEARLY AND STRONGLY EMPHASIZED IN THE COSTA RICAN AGREEMENT. IN THIS REGARD, I REPEAT THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO RESUME THE DIALOGUE PROCESS FROM WHICH THE FMLN UNILATERALLY WITHDREW. HOWEVER, AT THIS TIME IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE FMLN TO OPENLY PROMISE -- AND THIS IS STRONGLY DEMANDED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, INCLUDING THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT -- IT WILL CEASE TERRORIST ACTIONS, ESPECIALLY THOSE AFFECTING CIVILIANS. OBVIOUSLY A TOTAL DEMOBILIZATION AND RETURN TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS -- WITH THE GUARANTEES THAT MUST BE GIVEN TO THE FMLN MEMBERS -- WILL BE THE RESULT OF THE DIALOGUE PROCESS. THIS IS HOW WE UNDERSTAND AND VIEW THIS MATTER. THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE SHALL BE THE RESULT OF A CONVINCING EFFORT BY THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT, WHICH SHOULD PROVIDE THE NECESSARY GUARANTEES. IN THE SAME DOCUMENT, THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT HAS UNILATERALLY VOWED TO ENSURE THOSE GUARANTEES. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ASKED THE UNITED NATIONS TO ALSO JOIN THE CIAV , SO THE CIAV BEGINS AND IMPLEMENTS THE PROCESS TO DEMOBILIZE THE FMLN. THIS IS BASICALLY THE DESIRE OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS. IF THE FMLN WANTS TO GAIN POLITICAL ADVANTAGES, IT SHOULD PURSUE THIS WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS BECAUSE IT CAN NO LONGER BE JUSTIFIED AND HAS NEVER BEEN JUSTIFIED. HOWEVER, TODAY WE STRONGLY TELL THE FMLN THAT NO LONGER IS THERE ANY ROOM IN CENTRAL AMERICA, AND ESPECIALLY IN EL SALVADOR, FOR VIOLENT AND TERRORIST ACTIONS.
DEV-MUC3-0975	SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE -- WELL, AS I SAID BEFORE, WE BELIEVE THAT THE DEMOBILIZATION PROCESS BEING DISCUSSED FOR ANY REBEL ORGANIZATION SHOULD BE A COMPLETE PROCESS WITH THEIR PARTICIPATION IN A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. IT IS A PROCESS THAT IS ADAPTED TO FIT THE CIRCUMSTANCES. AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION IS IN CHARGE OF VERIFYING THIS PROCESS. WE BELIEVE THE ORGANIZATION HAS THE NECESSARY AUTHORITY TO DO IT, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE A MATTER OF LOOKING FOR OTHER OPTIONS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT EXIST. WE HAVE NO OTHER OPTIONS BESIDES THE ONES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DESIGNED FOR BOTH THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE AND FOR THE FMLN, SPECIFICALLY. IN GENERAL TERMS THESE OPTIONS COULD BE APPLIED TO ANY REBEL GROUP IN THE REGION. LUIS FUENTES FROM PRENSA GRAFICA. CARLOS ERNESTO RUGAMA FROM RADIO CADENA YSU. ...DIPLOMATIC AND TRADE RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA. HOW CAN THE REESTABLISHMENT OF THE RELATIONS BE ACHIEVED? POINT 12 OF THIS DECLARATION MAKES A FRATERNAL CALL TO EL SALVADOR AND NICARAGUA TO SEEK THE NORMALIZATION OF THE DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR RELATIONS THROUGH DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATIONS. WE MADE THE DECISION TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND THE RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA BECAUSE OF THE FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENTS. THEY WERE DIRECTLY SUPPORTING THE FMLN'S TERRORIST AGGRESSION. IN COSTA RICA WE GAVE THEM A DOCUMENT THAT CLEARLY DEFINES EL SALVADOR'S POSITION REGARDING POSSIBLE NEGOTIATIONS WHICH COULD NORMALLY REESTABLISH THE DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR RELATIONS. THIS DOCUMENT WAS NOT DISCUSSED BY THE FIVE PRESIDENTS BECAUSE IT ONLY CONCERNED TWO OF US. HOWEVER, THE DOCUMENT WAS GIVEN TO THE NICARAGUAN DELEGATION AND WE WILL WAIT FOR THE RESULTS. WE BELIEVE THAT IN GENERAL TERMS IT COULD STOP NICARAGUA'S INTERFERENCE AND ITS SUPPORT FOR THE FMLN. MARIA CORTINA FROM NOTIMEX. CORTINA WORDS INDISTINCT ...TO IMMEDIATELY INITIATE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS. IN ADDITION, THEY HAVE TO PUBLICLY STOP CONDUCTING ACTIONS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. THAT WAS PART OF THE PROPOSAL YOU MADE HERE ON SATURDAY. HOWEVER, I AM NOT YET CLEAR ON SOMETHING. TO INITIATE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS, DOES THE FMLN HAVE TO DECLARE A CEASE-FIRE OR WOULD A PUBLIC DECLARATION BE ENOUGH? WELL, WE MAINTAIN THE POSITION WE STATED ON 10 DECEMBER. WE BELIEVE THAT POINT 3 OF THIS DECLARATION UPHOLDS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING ALL ALONG REGARDING THE SEARCH FOR A PEACEFUL SOLUTION IN THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT. THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS WANT THE FMLN TO PUBLICLY STATE THAT THEY WILL IMMEDIATELY SUSPEND ALL THE VIOLENT ACTIONS THAT ARE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AFFECTING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT. THEY MUST KEEP THEIR WORD. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD AT LEAST BE A 5-DAY PERIOD BETWEEN THE PUBLIC STATEMENT AND THE BEGINNING OF A DIALOGUE. WE MAINTAIN THE POSITION, THAT IS THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND MYSELF, THAT NO HOSTILE ACTIONS BY THE FMLN ARE JUSTIFIABLE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE FMLN SHOULD STOP CARRYING OUT ALL HOSTILE ACTIONS IN THE COUNTRY. THIS INDICATES TWO THINGS WHICH MUST BE UNDERSTOOD. FIRST, THE FMLN ARE THE ONLY ONES CONDUCTING HOSTILE ACTIONS. THE GOVERNMENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS THAT BELONG TO IT DO NOT GENERATE HOSTILITIES. THEY SIMPLY RESPOND TO THE ACTIONS OF ARMED GROUPS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN MAKING TROUBLE AND OVERTHROWING A LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT. THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A LEGITIMATE DEFENSE AND TO THE PRESERVATION OF NATIONAL SECURITY IN FAVOR OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AS THE CONSTITUTION STATES. SECONDLY, THE FMLN HAS LOST ALL MANEUVERING OPTIONS. THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS SAID IT CLEARLY WHEN THEY STATED THAT THE FMLN HAD NO JUSTIFICATION FOR THEIR VIOLENT ACTIONS IN EL SALVADOR. THAT IS WHY WE ARE ONCE AGAIN ASKING FOR AN IMMEDIATE AND EFFECTIVE CEASE-FIRE. THESE WERE THE SAME WORDS USED AT THE SUMMIT HELD IN TELA, HONDURAS. HOWEVER, I REPEAT, WE WILL MAINTAIN THE POSITION WE HAD BEFORE, EVEN THOUGH WE TOTALLY AGREE WITH THIS DOCUMENT.
DEV-MUC3-0976	BOGOTA, 12 DEC 89 -- A COLOMBIAN OFFICIAL FROM THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK AND A PROSECUTOR FROM THE MEDELLIN HIGHER COURT WERE ASSASSINATED IN THE LAST FEW HOURS NEAR THIS NORTHWESTERN CITY, THE SECOND LARGEST IN COLOMBIA, POLICE SPOKESMEN HAVE REPORTED. EDGAR HENAO, 55, CIVIL ENGINEER, ECONOMIST, AND TOP EXECUTIVE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL CREDIT ORGANIZATION, WAS SHOT SEVERAL TIMES BY SOME UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE AT HIS FARM CALLED EL LIMON, VENECIA MUNICIPALITY, 61 KM SOUTHWEST OF MEDELLIN. HENAO, WHO HAS BEEN WORKING FOR THE IDB FOR 13 YEARS, HAD ARRIVED IN COLOMBIA ON 7 DECEMBER AND WAS PREPARING TO LEAVE FOR JAMAICA, THE SOURCES ADDED. MOREOVER, 4TH PROSECUTOR GABRIEL JAIME VELEZ WAS ATTACKED IN ENVIGADO, 10 KM FROM MEDELLIN, BY AN INDIVIDUAL WHO FIRED 13 SHOTS KILLING HIM INSTANTLY AS HE WAS WALKING HOME. VELEZ, 38, WHO WAS HANDLING SEVERAL KIDNAPPING AND DRUG TRAFFICKING CASES, HAD BEING THREATENED, BUT HE HAD NO BODYGUARDS, RELATIVES OF THE VICTIM SAID. DURING THE LAST 6 MONTHS, FIVE JUDGES AND MAGISTRATES HAVE BEEN KILLED BY HIRED ASSASSINS IN MEDELLIN. ALSO TODAY IN BUENAVENTURA, THE MAJOR COLOMBIAN PORT ON THE PACIFIC COAST, JUDGE SOFIA DE ROLDAN WAS SHOT TO DEATH BY HIRED ASSASSINS. SHE WAS PREPARING FOR A NEW JOB IN CALI, IN WESTERN COLOMBIA.
DEV-MUC3-0977	MANAGUA , 12 DEC 89 -- NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA HAS REPORTED THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMY IS BOMBING THE AREA SURROUNDING A VOLCANO NEAR THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL TONIGHT, "THREATENING THE LIVES AND SECURITY OF SALVADORANS." IN A RADIO AND TELEVISION ADDRESS TO NICARAGUANS TO EXPLAIN THE SCOPE OF THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED ON 12 DECEMBER IN COSTA RICA -- WHERE THE SIXTH CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMIT WAS HELD -- ORTEGA POINTED OUT THAT THESE BOMBINGS "ARE AGAINST THE AGREEMENTS" WHICH WERE RECENTLY SIGNED. "THE BOMBS THE SALVADORAN ARMY IS LAUNCHING DO NOT HELP AT ALL IN COMPLYING WITH THE AGREEMENTS WE SIGNED ON 12 DECEMBER IN COSTA RICA," PRESIDENT ORTEGA, WHO SPOKE CALMLY, WARNED. ORTEGA APPEALED TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT TO CEASE THE BOMBINGS. THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT INSISTED ON THE "GREAT RESPONSIBILITY" OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN THE FULFILLMENT OF THE AGREEMENTS, PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THE POINTS THAT DEAL WITH THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE "CONTRAS" STATIONED IN HONDURAS. ORTEGA RECALLED THAT THE UNITED STATES FINANCES THE "CONTRAS" AND THEREFORE WASHINGTON HAS IN ITS HANDS OF "GIVING SOME TRANQUILITY TO THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE." "THIS IS NOW A DEMAND OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEOPLES, WHICH WAS RATIFIED AT THE MEETING," ORTEGA ADDED. ORTEGA RECALLED THAT THE DEADLINE TO DEMOBILIZE THE REBELS ENDED ON 5 DECEMBER AND THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S ATTITUDE WAS TO OPPOSE THE DISBANDING OF THE "CONTRAS." ORTEGA STATED: "THUS, I BELIEVE IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT RESPECT THE AGREEMENTS AND STOP DISRESPECTING THE RESOLVE OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND PEOPLES WHO WANT PEACE." ORTEGA TRUSTS THAT WITH THE UN SUPPORT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WILL MAKE EFFORTS TO PROMOTE THE DEMOBILIZATION OF APPROXIMATELY 12,000 CONTRAS STATIONED IN HONDURAS, AS WELL AS THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT TO SEEK A SOLUTION TO AN OVER 10-YEAR-LONG WAR. ORTEGA ADMITTED THAT HE GETS WORRIED EVERY TIME HE ATTENDS A SUMMIT, BECAUSE THESE MEETINGS "ARE HELD UNDER U.S. PRESSURE," BUT FINALLY "WE REACHED AGREEMENTS THAT STRENGTHEN THE PEACE PROCESS." ACCORDING TO ORTEGA, THE PEACE PLANS SIGNED BY THE AREA PRESIDENTS "HAVE HAD A GOOD EFFECT IN NICARAGUA," BUT HE WARNED THAT HE COULD NOT SAY THE SAME FOR EL SALVADOR, "WITH WHICH WE CANNOT BE PLEASED YET."
DEV-MUC3-0978	SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE -- AND AGAIN, BECAUSE THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS DID NOT WANT TO STATE THESE COUNTRIES BY NAME, I WILL REFRAIN MYSELF FROM DOING IT AT THIS TIME, BUT THEY ARE VERY OBVIOUS, WHO AND WHAT THEY . BUT I THINK OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER IF THE FMLN WOULD ACT RATIONALLY AND ACCEPT THAT THEY HAVE NO LONGER ANY RECOGNITION FOR WHAT THEY DO, AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN CONDEMNED, AND NOT ONLY AS AN IRREGULAR FORCE OR GROUP. THEY HAVE NOW BEEN CONDEMNED AS BEING A TERRORIST GROUP, WHICH IS THE SECOND ASPECT OF THE THIRD POINT IN THE AGREEMENT. THEREFORE, MAYBE THEY SHOULD START THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. MAYBE THE VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE, WHOSE ANNIVERSARY WE CELEBRATE TODAY, AND WHO IS THE GUARDIAN OF ALL THE AMERICAN COUNTRIES, WILL SHINE SOME LIGHT ON THESE IRRATIONAL PEOPLE. THEY MIGHT SEE THIS AS A VERY CLEAR SIGN THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER JUSTIFY OR LIE, OR TRY TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT WHAT THEY DO IS GOOD. THAT IS NOT WHAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ARE LOOKING FOR. THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM AND ALL THEIR EFFORTS ARE DIRECTED IN THAT WAY. ANA ARANDA FROM THE MIAMI HERALD. IF THE GOVERNMENT AT ANY POINT CONFRONTED NICARAGUA OR WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT AS SUCH WAS TRULY INVOLVED IN SENDING WEAPONS TO THE FMLN? WELL, HE WAS WATCHING SOME OF THE VIDEOTAPES THAT I TOOK. WE WERE WATCHING THEM WITH THE OTHER CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS. AFTER A FEW MINUTES, HE SAID HE HAD SOME TELEPHONE CALLS TO MAKE AND HE GOT UP AND LEFT. OBVIOUSLY HE COULD NOT JUSTIFY WHAT HE WAS SEEING AND WHAT THE OTHER PRESIDENTS WERE WITNESSING THERE ON THE TV SCREEN. THERE WAS SOME CONFRONTATION WITH ORTEGA OBVIOUSLY, BUT I WILL, YOU KNOW, WILL SAY THAT I DID NOT MIND WHERE THE WAREHOUSE WAS OR WHERE THEY COME FROM. IT IS SIMPLY THE FACT THAT THEY WERE AT SOME POINT IN TIME IN NICARAGUA AND NICARAGUA WAS SENDING THEM OVER TO EL SALVADOR. WHETHER THEY CAME FROM THE SOVIET UNION OR WHETHER THEY BOUGHT THEM FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE, OR WHEREVER THEY CAME FROM, IT REALLY MAKES NO DIFFERENCE. WITHIN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PLAN, THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY ARE COMING THROUGH NICARAGUA WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT, AND THAT IS A VIOLATION OF THE AGREEMENT. WHAT COULD HE SAY? NO, HE CAME OUT TRYING TO PRODUCE SOME SORT OF DUST OVER THE ISSUE -- LIKE WE CALL IT HERE -- THROUGH HIS MINISTER OF FOREIGN RELATIONS. HE WAS ACCUSING COSTA RICA OF SENDING AID TO THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE. AND MAYBE HE THOUGHT TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION FROM THE SALVADORAN CASE BY TRYING TO SAY THAT COSTA RICA WAS SENDING WEAPONS TO THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE. THEN OBVIOUSLY HE ACCUSED EVERYBODY OF SENDING WEAPONS TO NICARAGUA. THE POINT IS, FIRST OF ALL, HE DID NOT CONVINCE ANY OF THE OTHER FOUR PRESIDENTS. THAT IS FOR SURE. AND THERE WERE NO ARGUMENTS HE MADE IN FRONT OF THE PRESS OR AT ANY POINT IN TIME WHERE THEY DENIED THAT THEY HAVE BEEN HELPING THE FMLN. I MEAN, IT IS VERY CLEAR AND OBVIOUS THAT THEY HAVE HELPED THE FMLN NOT SINCE NOVEMBER 11. ALL THE WEAPONS THAT WERE ALREADY HERE BY NOVEMBER 11 ALSO CAME THROUGH NICARAGUA. RICARDO CLEMENS FROM VISNEWS. CASE OF JENNIFER CASOLO THERE WAS A SERIES OF LEGISLATIVE ISSUES THAT ARE NOT VERY CLEAR AND THERE IS SOME KIND OF IMPASSE REGARDING HER TRIAL. WILL THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HELP TO ACCELERATE THE TRIAL, OR WILL IT ISSUE SOME KIND OF PARDON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? NO, THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH CANNOT INTERFERE WITH THE JUDICIAL PROCESS OF ANY PERSON IN THE COUNTRY. IT WOULD HAVE TO BE THE SUPREME COURT OR THE JUDICIARY THAT DEALS WITH THE PROBLEM. THEY HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT THE LAW IS AND WHAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW SHOULD BE. OUR POSITION IS THAT THE LAW SHOULD BE APPLIED IMPARTIALLY, AND EVERYTHING THAT THE JUDGE OR ANYBODY ELSE DOES IN THE STATE SHOULD BE DONE WITHIN THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK. BUT WE HAVE NO POSSIBILITY OF INTERVENING IN THE JUDICIARY PROCESS. THERE IS A SEPARATION OF POWERS BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. THANK YOU, MR PRESIDENT. THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU ALL.
DEV-MUC3-0979	SAN SALVADOR, 13 DEC 89 -- THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES TODAY DENIED CHARGES BY NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA THAT THE AIR FORCE "LAST NIGHT BOMBED AREAS NEAR SAN SALVADOR VOLCANO, ENDANGERING THE LIVES AND SECURITY" OF CIVIIANS. A SPOKESMAN FOR THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE SAID: "IT IS FALSE. WE ARE NOT BOMBING." HE EXPLAINED THAT "SOME EXPLOSIONS" HEARD LAST NIGHT ON THE SLOPES OF THE VOLCANO WERE FLARES FIRED "TO POINT OUT" TO ARMY UNITS ON LAND "AREAS WHERE GUERILLA COLUMNS WERE MOVING." HE SAID: "THE FLARES WERE LAUNCHED FROM HELICOPTERS, AND AT NO TIME DID WE BOMB POPULATED AREAS." ACCORDING TO THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE "BOMBINGS CONTRADICT THE AGREEMENTS WE SIGNED YESTERDAY IN COSTA RICA," IN WHICH THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ASKED THE FMLN TO END HOSTILITIES.
DEV-MUC3-0980	BOGOTA, 12 DEC 89 -- BRITISH ENGINEER JOHN MARCK JONES , KIDNAPPED BY THE MARXIST-LENINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY , RESIDES IN COLOMBIA AND BOTH HIS WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN ARE COLOMBIANS, IT WAS OFICIALLY REPORTED TODAY. JONES, 45, WHO WAS REPORTED MISSING IN ARAUCA DEPARTMENT IN COLOMBIA'S NORTHEAST EARLY ON 11 DECEMBER, IS THE OWNER OF ALTA TENSION DE COLOMBIA, A POWER COMPANY. JONES' RELATIVES TOLD THE LOCAL PRESS THAT, DESPITE THE INITIAL REPORTS, THE BRITISH ENGINEER DOES NOT WORK FOR A MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE ELN MISTOOK HIM FOR THE EMPLOYEE OF SOME FOREIGN COMPANY AND THAT THEY MIGHT BE PLANNING TO DEMAND A RANSOM. JONES WAS TAKEN IN A MOUNTAINOUS AREA OF THE CATATUMBO OIL BASIN, NEAR THE BORDER WITH VENEZUELA, WHILE DRIVING WITH TWO FELLOW WORKERS, WHO WERE NOT DETAINED. THESE MEN TOLD THE COLOMBIAN POLICE THAT THE KIDNAPPERS IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS ELN MEMBERS AND THAT THEY TOOK THE ENGINEER WHEN THEY CONFIRMED HE WAS A FOREIGNER. JONES' POWER COMPANY BUILDS POWER SUBSTATIONS IN OIL CAMPS IN THE AREA WHERE HE WAS KIDNAPPED. A POLICE SOURCE TOLD EFE THAT A SPECIALIZED AGENCY, WHICH IS INVESTIGATING THE KIDNAPPING, IS TRYING TO DETERMINE THE ENGINEER'S WHEREABOUTS. THE ELN HAS A LONG HISTORY OF KIDNAPPINGS AND EXTORTION AGAINST OIL GROUPS, BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEMBERS, AND ENGINEERS.
DEV-MUC3-0981	MANAGUA , 13 DEC 89 -- ....I WAS IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA AT A MEETING OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS. THIS MEETING WAS OF URGENT NATURE TO DISCUSS ISSUES SUCH AS EL SALVADOR, NICARAGUA, THE CONTRAS' DEMOBILIZATION, AND HUMAN RIGHTS. AT THIS MEETING, WE HELD IN-DEPTH DISCUSSIONS OF PROBLEMS THAT ARE BEING EXPERIENCED IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY THE SITUATION BEING EXPERIENCED IN NEIGHBORING EL SALVADOR, WHICH IS FACING AN INTERNAL CONFLICT -- MORE THAN A DECADE OF CONTINUED WAR AND INTERNAL CONFLICT. EL SALVADOR HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO A VERY STRONG CONFRONTATION, WHICH LATELY HAS WORSENED. AS YOU ALL KNOW, THE CIVILIAN POPULATION, THE CLERGY, NUNS, AND UNION AND LABOR LEADERS HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF THIS TRAGIC SITUATION. AT THIS MEETING, NICARAGUA STATED ITS POSITION THAT THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH NEGOTIATION AND NOT BY WAY OF VIOLENCE. THIS POSITION FULLY COINCIDES WITH THE POSITION THE FMLN HAS DEFENDED. ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS THE FMLN HAS MADE PEACE PROPOSALS AND IT HAS CALLED FOR NEGOTIATED SOLUTIONS TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT AND FOR REAL NEGOTIATIONS. FOLLOWING A LENGTHY AND INTENSE DISCUSSION OF THE SALVADORAN ISSUE, WE CAME TO AN AGREEMENT, NOT ONLY WITH REGARD TO GENERAL PLEASE AND STATEMENTS CONCERNING THE SITUATION IN THE NEIGHBORING CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY, BUT ON VERY SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT COULD LEAD TO SOLUTION OF THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT. THUS, IN POINT THREE, THE FIVE PRESIDENTS DECIDED TO REQUEST THAT THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL MAKE A VERY SPECIAL PERSONAL EFFORT TO BRING ABOUT A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN, THEREBY CONTRIBUTING TOWARD THE TALKS' SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT. NICARAGUA HAS THUS SUPPORTED THE NEGOTIATED SOLUTION THE FMLN HAS VIGOROUSLY AND CONSISTENTLY CALLED FOR, AND WITH WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HEADED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ALSO CLAIMS TO AGREE. SUCH NEGOTIATION WOULD LEAD TO A DIALOGUE PROCESS THAT WOULD RESULTE IN SOLVING THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT. LIKEWISE, WE UNDERSCORED HUMAN RIGHTS IN CENTRAL AMERICA, BECAUSE THESE RIGHTS ARE SYSTEMATICALLY VIOLATED IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES. THIS HAS BEEN CLEARLY STATED AT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. I AM ESPECIALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR, WHERE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS WERE RECENTLY MURDERED, AND WHERE THE ARMY HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF EXERTING INDISCRIMINATE REPRESSION AGAINST THE PEOPLE, THROUGH AERIAL AS WELL AS ARTILLERY AND INFANTRY ATTACKS. THIS HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE IS WORRISOME TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, AND ESPECIALLY TO NICARAGUA. WE ALSO REACHED AN AGREEMENT BY WHICH THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS INSISTED ON THE NEED FOR RESPECT OF HUMAN RIGHTS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENTS, THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS RATIFIED THEIR PLEDGES TO FULLY RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE CIVILIAN, POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL RIGHTS ESTABLISHED IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CONSTITUTIONS, AND IN SIGNED AND RATIFIED INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS. NICARAGUA'S POSITION HAS NOT WAVERED; IT HAS MAINTAINED ITS POSITIONS THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES ARE WILLING TO HAVE RECOGNIZED INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES, AND HELP DEFEND HUMAN RIGHTS IN CENTRAL AMERICA. THERE ARE FORCES, CENTRAL AMERICAN ARMIES ESPECIALLY, AMONG THEM THE SALVADORAN ARMY -- WHICH HAS ORGANIZED DEATH SQUADS THAT SYSTEMATICALLY MURDER SALVADORAN PEOPLE -- WHOSE GOVERNMENTS AND PRESIDENTS ARE FACED WITH CERTAIN LIMITATIONS IN OVERCOMING THE PROBLEM OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. THIS, I BELIEVE, IS WHERE THE GREATEST STRENGTH MUST BE EXERTED AND THE GREATEST EFFORT MADE TO DISBAND THE DEATH SQUADS SO THAT HUMAN RIGHTS CAN BE RESPECTED, A PEACEFUL SOLUTION CAN BE FOUND FOR ALL THE CONFLICTS IN THESE COUNTRIES, AND A WORSENING OF VIOLENCE CAN BE AVOIDED, ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS VIOLENCE IS ON THE INCREASE BECAUSE OF THE INJUSTICE THAT PREVAILS IN THESE COUNTRIES DUE TO A LACK OF EQUITY, FREEDOM, AND JUSTICE, WHICH IS AT THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM.
DEV-MUC3-0982	GUATEMALA CITY, 13 DEC 89 -- PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO HAS REFERRED TO THE POSSIBILITY OF A DIALOGUE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES AND MEMBERS OF THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY, URNG, CLEARLY STATING THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF A DIALOGUE WITH THAT ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN DISCUSSED. HE ADDED THAT THE URNG MUST FIRST STATE THAT IT IS WILLING TO PEACEFULLY PARTICIPATE IN THE DIALOGUE. THE GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT ADDED THAT THE REBELS MUST UNDERSTAND THA THEY CANNOT TALK ABOUT DIALOGUE WHEN PERPETRATING ACTS OF TREASON AGAINST THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEOPLE, MEANING PLACING BOMBS AND PERPETRATING ACTS OF TERRORISM. THE URNG MUST DECIDE TO SUSPEND ITS TERRORIST ACTIONS IF IT WANTS TO HOLD A DIALOGUE, HE SAID. CEREZO ADDED THAT THERE IS A POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL THE IDEOLOGIES IN GUATEMALA. CEREZO AREVALO ADDED THAT IF THE URNG MEMBERS WISH TO HOLD A DIALOGUE, THEY MAY DO SO. IN FACT, HE SAID, IF THEY WANT TO RETURN TO THE COUNTRY WE CAN DISCUSS THE SECURITY CONDITIONS -- BUT THEY MUST PUBLICLY STATE THEIR DECISION TO RETURN IN PEACE. OTHERWISE, THE PRESIDENT ADDED, IT WOULD BE TANTAMOUNT TO GIVING THE OTHER, RIGHT-WING, TERRORISTS, WHO ATTACK STUDENTS, ENGAGE IN KIDNAPPING, AND PLACE BOMBS, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN AN INTERNAL DIALOGUE. THE URNG MUST DECIDE IF IT WANTS TO JOIN US. THEY MUST DO IT PEACEFULLY BECAUSE THAT IS THE PROPER THING. THE PEOPLE ARE FED UP WITH VIOLENCE AND WAR, HE SAID. PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO REFERRED TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PARLIAMENT'S FUTURE DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE, HELD AT THE GUATEMALAN AIR FORCE'S INSTALLATIONS UPON HIS RETURN TO THE COUNTRY FROM COSTA RICA. HE SAID THAT THE SAN ISIDRO DECLARATION SIGNED BY THE FIVE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS INCLUDED TWO IMPRESSIVE DECISIONS. HE SAID THAT THEY SIGNED AN AGREEMENT ON THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PARLIAMENT -- EACH COUNTRY MAY DECIDE ON ITS CONTRIBUTION AS IT SEES FIT -- A SUBJECT WHICH HAD DELAYED THE SIGNATURE OF THE APPROPRIATE DOCUMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE ECOLOGY AND DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION WILL BEGIN TO OPERATE BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT ITS EFFORTS WILL HELP CONSOLIDATE PEACE AND DEMOCRACY IN THE AREA.
DEV-MUC3-0983	HAVANA , 13 DEC 89 -- MONTENEGRO, WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THE THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT WILL CONTINUE WITH THE CURRENT MILITARY OFFENSIVE THAT BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER SINCE THE AGREEMENT AMONG THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS WAS SIGNED? THE TRUTH IS THAT THE REASONS WHY THE FMLN BEGAN ITS OFFENSIVE ON 11 NOVEMBER 1989 HAVE NOT CHANGED AT ALL. THUS, THE FMLN CANNOT STOP ITS OFFENSIVE. ON THE CONTRARY, WHAT HAPPENED IN EL SALVADOR IS THAT THE FMLN OFFENSIVE STRATEGICALLY TURNED THE WAR. THAT TURN INCLUDED A NUMBER OF MILITARY, POLITICAL, AND DIPLOMATIC IMPLICATIONS. THUS, THE TRUTH IS THAT THE AGREEMENT SIGNED IN SAN ISIDRO DE CORONADO DID NOT PROPOSE REALISTIC NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE CONFLICT. YESTERDAY, 12 DECEMBER, THE FMLN ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE WHICH VEHEMENTLY EXPRESSED ITS ABSOLUTE REJECTION OF THE AGREEMENT SIGNED AT THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT. AT PRESENT, THE FMLN BELIEVES THAT DESPITE WHAT THE OTHER FOUR CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS SAY, IT IS CLEARER THAN EVER THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS A FASCIST, MILITARY DICTATORSHIP. THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT VIOLATES PEOPLE'S HUMAN RIGHTS AND THAT FACT HAS BEEN CLEARLY PROVED TO THE ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. THEREFORE, ANY ATTEMPT TO HELP THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT OR ANY KIND OF SUPPORT GIVEN TO IT NOTHING BUT A PIECE OF PAPER THAT DOES NOT HAVE TOO MUCH VALIDITY TO THE FMLN. IN OTHER WORDS COMRADE, THE FMLN WILL MAINTAIN THE SAME LEVEL OF CONFRONTATION WITH THE DICTATORSHIP? I BELIEVE THE FMLN'S ARMED STRUGGLE IS NOW MORE LEGITIMATE THAN EVER. THE SUMMIT CONFIRMED THE LEGITIMACY OF THE FMLN'S STRUGGLE, BECAUSE THE AGREEMENT RESULTING FROM THAT SUMMIT IS NEITHER FEASIBLE NOR REAL. THE FMLN WILL THEREFORE CONTINUE ITS POLITICAL - MILITARY OFFENSIVE. THE FMLN WILL INCREASE ITS ACTIONS. THE FMLN IS REORGANIZING ITS POLITICAL - MILITARY APPARATUS. IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, WE WILL CLEARLY SHOW WHAT THE FMLN CAN DO. THE FMLN WILL NOT SURRENDER ITS WEAPONS, ESPECIALLY NOW. THE FMLN HAS NO OBLIGATION TO ABIDE BY AN AGREEMENT THAT DOES NOT REFLECT THE SALVADORAN REALITY AT ALL. IF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS CHOSE TO CLOSE THEIR EYES TO WHAT IS GOING ON THAT IS REALLY THEIR PROBLEM. TWO DAYS AFTER THE END OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMIT, WHAT IS THE CURRENT MILITARY SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR? AS I TOLD YOU EARLIER IN ANSWERING THE FIRST QUESTION, THE FIRST THING IS THAT THE FMLN DEFINATELY CHANGED THE WAR. THIS MEANS THAT THE FMLN MADE THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES RETREAT FROM THE MOUNTAINS TO THE HEART OF THE CITIES INCLUDING THE CAPITAL CITY OF SAN SALVADOR. AT PRESENT, WE HAVE ALMOST ABSOLUTE CONTROL OVER THE HIGHWAYS IN 14, I MEAN 12 SALVADORAN DEPARTMENTS. THERE HAVE BEEN ACTIONS IN AHUACHAPAN AND SONSONATE, TWO DEPARTMENTS THAT HAD BEEN ALMOST UNTOUCHED BY THE WAR. THERE IS A STRATEGIC SIEGE IN SAN SALVADOR. THE ARMY HAS 65 PERCENT OF ITS FORCES STATIONED IN SAN SALVADOR. THE ARMY HAS ABANDONED LARGE AREAS. AS FOR SABOTAGE OPERATIONS, AT PRESENT THERE ARE 10 110,000-VOLT PRIMARY LINES THAT ARE OUT OF SERVICE. THAT REPRESENTS A 40-PERCENT ENERGY DEFICIT IN THE COUNTRY. THERE HAVE BEEN LONG PERIODS OF 100-PERCENT POWER OUTAGES IN SAN SALVADOR. IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN CONTROL THAT SITUATION. WE DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG THEY WILL ENDURE IT. BUT IN ANY CASE, A STRONG BLOW BY THE FMLN FORCES IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR SOMEWHERE IN EL SALVADOR AT ANY TIME.
DEV-MUC3-0984	CLANDESTINE, 13 DEC 89 -- WE COULD SAY THAT TO A GREAT EXTENT THE DECLARATION IS FULL OF PRETTY WORDS, SIMILAR TO THOSE CRISTIANI USES, IN THE PARTS WHERE THE DECLARATION CALLS ON THE FMLN TO JOIN THE ALLEGED DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND SAYS THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS LEGITIMATE. HOWEVER, IF WE LOOK CAREFULLY, WE CAN SEE WHAT IS BEHIND THE WORDS AND THAT IN ADDITION TO DECLARING SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT, AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO DO THE SALVADORAN ARMY A FAVOR. THIS IS DONE BY ASKING THE FMLN TO STOP ALL VIOLENT ACTIONS THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AFFECT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. WE KNOW THAT THIS IS HOW THE GOVERNMENT REFERS TO SIEGES ON CITIES, TO TRANSPORTATION STRIKES, AND TO SABOTAGE, THE ARMY'S MOST SERIOUS SOURCES OF CONCERN. UNDERNEATH THIS DECLARATION IS A REQUEST FOR THE FMLN TO LEAVE THE CITIES BECAUSE THE ARMY CAN NO LONGER STAND THE SITUATION AND FEELS IT IS NEAR COLLAPSE. THE DECLARATION DOES NOT STATE ANY CONCERN FOR BOMBINGS BECAUSE CONSIDERING THE CONDITION IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT IS NOW, ANY STATEMENT IN THIS REGARD WOULD BE LIKE ADDING FUEL TO THE FIRE. THE DECLARATION IS LIKE A WALKING STICK TO KEEP THE DICTATORSHIP UP, AND, AS THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND HAS STATED IN A COMMUNIQUE, IT IS EVIDENCE OF THE POLITICAL AND MILITARY CRISIS IN WHICH THIS GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN PLACED AS A RESULT OF THE OFFENSIVE CARRIED OUT BY ALL OF YOU. TO CONCLUDE: LET US WAIT AND SEE IF THIS DECLARATION WILL SAVE CRISTIANI FROM INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION. IT IS IMPORTANT TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHAT THE GENERAL COMMAND HAS STATED IN ITS COMMUNIQUE, THAT THE AGREEMENTS BY GOVERNMENTS THAT DO NOT KNOW THE TRUE SITUATION IN OUR COUNTRY AND THAT SERVE OTHER INTERESTS CANNOT DEMOBILIZE THE FMLN BECAUSE THE FMLN ENJOYS POPULAR SUPPORT THROUGHOUT THE NATION. THE FMLN IS NOT LIKE THE CONTRAS WHO ARE IN HONDURAS AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS CAN GO TO THEIR CAMPS TO DEMOBILIZE THEM. IN EL SALVADOR THE SITUATION IS VERY DIFFERENT. CRISTIANI HIMSELF WAS UNABLE TO ANSWER A JOURNALIST WHO ASKED HIM IF HE WAS GOING TO DEMOBILIZE THE FMLN IN SAN SALVADOR, IN GUAZAPA, IN CHALATENANGO, AND MORAZAN. THE COSTA RICA DECLARATION IS NEITHER REALISTIC NOR VIABLE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS ALREADY POINTING OUT. AN INTERNATIONAL TELEVISION NETWORK HAS SAID THAT FOLLOWING THIS DECLARATION, THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENT COULD BECOME JUST WORDS. A JOURNALIST HAS ASKED HOW MUCH THIS ALLEGED INTERNATIONAL VICTORY OF CRISTIANI IS GOING TO LAST. MEANWHILE, THE ARCHBISHOP OF GUATEMALA HAS SAID THAT HE DOES NOT EXPECT ANYTHING GOOD FROM THE MEETING BECAUSE NEITHER THE CONTRAS NOR THE FMLN WERE PRESENT. THE REACTION TO THE RESULTS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT ARE ALONG THESE LINES. THE TRUTH IS THAT TRUE FACTS ARE WHAT COUNTS. WORDS AND PAPER ARE ALWAYS DEFEATED BY FACTS. THE TRUTH IS THAT THE ARMY KEEPS BOMBING AND THAT GENOCIDE WILL ALWAYS BE CONDEMNED. THE TRUTH IS THAT YOUR EFFORTS, COMRADES, WILL NOT CEASE UNTIL THE DICTATORSHIP IS DEFINITELY DEFEATED.
DEV-MUC3-0985	SAN SALVADOR, 13 DEC 89 -- MARIA JULIO HERNANDEZ, DIRECTOR OF THE LEGAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE OF THE ARCHBISHOPRIC, IS THE ONE WHO BRAINWASHED THE WITNESS OF THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS AND TWO WOMEN. THE PREVIOUS STATEMENT WAS MADE ON 12 DECEMBER BY COLONEL ORLANDO INOCENTE MONTANO DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE DEFENSE MINISTRY TO THE LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL REPORTERS. THE WITNESS OF THE MASSACRE, LUCIA BARRERA DE CERNA, WAS TAKEN TO THE UNITED STATES WHERE SHE UNDERWENT INTERROGATIONS BY THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION . THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS VERY INTERESTED IN THE THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE BEING CONDUCTED BY THE SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION FORCES OF SPAIN, THE U.S. FBI, AND SCOTLAND YARD OF ENGLAND. ACCORDING TO A WASHINGTON DATELINE ITEM TRANSMITTED ON 11 DECEMBER BY THE UPI NEWS AGENCY, SAN SALVADOR ARCHBISHOP MSGR ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF HAVING BRAINWASHED LUCIA BARRERA DE CERNA, THE ONLY WITNESS IN THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS AND TWO EMPLOYEES. ACCORDING TO THE FBI INVESTIGATIONS, THE WITNESS HAS CHANGED HER STORY THREE TIMES; THIS WAS DETERMINED BY A LIE DETECTOR TEST.
DEV-MUC3-0986	WASHINGTON DC , 13 DEC 89 -- U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH WILL GO TO VIOLENCE-TORN COLOMBIA ON FEBRUARY 15 FOR A FOUR-NATION SUMMIT ON ILLEGAL DRUGS, THE WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCED TODAY. WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN MARLIN FITZWATER SAID BUSH WILL MEET IN CARTAGENA, A PORT CITY ABOUT 640 KILOMETERS NORTH OF BOGOTA, WITH COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA AND PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA. FITZWATER SAID BUSH IS GOING TO SHOW HIS SUPPORT FOR BARCO, WHO HAS WAGED A NATION-WIDE WAR AGAINST DRUG LORDS SINCE LAST AUGUST. COLOMBIAN COCAINE LORDS HAVE SET OFF MORE THAN 260 BOMBS, KILLING AT LEAST 190 PEOPLE, IN RETALIATION FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S CRACKDOWN. A U.S. ADVANCE TEAM, HEADED BY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE BERNARD ARONSON, HAS BEEN SENT TO COLOMBIA TO COMPLETE PLANS FOR THE SUMMIT. THE FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT FOLLOWED BUSH'S SIGNING LEGISLATION EARLIER TODAY AUTHORIZING 240 MILLION DOLLARS IN AID TO THE THREE ANDEAN NATIONS, WHICH ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR AN ESTIMATED 80 PERCENT OF THE COCAINE THAT MAKES ITS WAY INTO THE UNITED STATES. THE LEGISLATION AUTHORIZES SPENDING 125 MILLION DOLLARS FOR MILITARY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AID AND 115 MILLION DOLLARS FOR NARCOTICS CONTROL ASSISTANCE. THE MEETING IS EXPECTED TO LAST ONE DAY.
DEV-MUC3-0987	SANTIAGO, 14 DEC 89 -- PRESIDENT PINOCHET HAS BRANDED FOREIGN JOURNALISTS AS INTRUDERS. THE HEAD OF STATE WAS CLEARLY UPSET BY THE PRESENCE OF INTERNATIONAL JOURNALISTS AND OBSERVERS WHEN HE WENT TO VOTE. JOURNALIST ELIANA HENRIQUEZ WILL NOW GIVE US MORE DETAILS. GOOD AFTERNOON. PRESIDENT AUGUSTO PINOCHET THIS MORNING LEFT THE HIGHER INSTITUTE OF COMMERCE WHERE HE WENT TO VOTE, ANGRY WITH CHILEANS AND CLEARLY UPSET BY THE PRESENCE OF INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS AND JOURNALISTS. THE HEAD OF STATE WALKED FROM THE LA MONEDA PALACE TO THE HIGHER INSTITUTE OF COMMERCE, WHICH IS AT THE INTERSECTION OF AMUNATEGUI AND MONEDA STREETS. HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THE INTERIOR MINISTER, THE MINISTER SECRETARY GENERAL OF GOVERNMENT, THE PRESIDENTIAL GENERAL SECRETARY, AND THE CHIEF OF THE MILITARY HOUSEHOLD. HE GREETED GENERAL CARLOS PARERA, THE MILITARY COMMANDER OF THE METROPOLITAN REGION, AND THE SANTIAGO MAYOR. PINOCHET THEN WENT TO VOTING TABLE NO 1 WHERE HE WAS SCHEDULED TO VOTE. HE SAW DOZENS OF FOREIGN TELEVISION CAMERAMEN, PHOTOGRAPHERS, AND JOURNALISTS. BEFORE ENTERING THE VOTING BOOTH, PINOCHET SAID HE WAS IN VERY GOOD SPIRITS AND VERY HAPPY. AFTER VOTING, PINOCHET SAID HE WAS VERY SATISFIED BECAUSE THIS MEANT THE END OF THE MISSION HE BEGAN ON 11 SEPTEMBER 1973. HE ADDED THAT HE EXPECTED THE ELECTION TO DEVELOP AS CALMLY AS USUAL. WHEN A U.S. NEWSWOMAN APPROACHED HIM FOR AN INTERVIEW, PINOCHET, IRRITATED, ASKED HER WHAT SHE WAS DOING PUTTING HER NOSE IN HERE; HE TOLD HER THAT THIS IS OUR PROBLEM, NOT YOURS, INTRUDERS. PINOCHET THEN TURNED TO THE LOCAL NEWSMEN AND TOLD THEM THAT HE IS UNHAPPY WITH CHILEANS FOR ALLOWING FOREIGN OBSERVERS TO ENTER THE COUNTRY. I AM UNHAPPY WITH CHILEANS BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOST THEIR FEELING OF NATIONALITY BY ACCEPTING THE PRESENCE OF A BUNCH OF OUTSIDERS WHO HAVE COME TO LOOK OVER WHAT WE ARE DOING. WHAT DO THEY THINK THEY ARE DOING? LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE: THESE OUTSIDERS ARE HERE TO CHECK ON THE WAY IN WHICH THEIR MONEY HAS BEEN INVESTED BY THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND THESE GENTLEMEN . AS HE WAS LEAVING THE VOTING SITE, PINOCHET TOLD A URUGUAYAN CORRESPONDENT THAT THE OBSERVERS ARE INTRUDERS. INTERIOR MINISTER CARLOS CACERES AFFIRMED THAT THE SITUATION AROUND THE COUNTRY REMAINS NORMAL AND ORDERLY. HE ADDED THAT THE ONLY INCIDENT WAS THE BOMB EXPLOSION AT THE EL SALVADORAN EMBASSY AND A MINOR INCIDENT THAT TOOK PLACE THIS MORNING IN THE LOCALITY OF MARIA PINTO. CACERES SAID THAT HE WILL REMAIN ALL DAY AT THE LA MONEDA PALACE IN ORDER TO BRIEF PRESIDENT PINOCHET ON THE VOTING PROCEEDINGS AND ANY SECURITY PROBLEM THAT MIGHT ARISE. FINALLY, HE SAID THAT THE HEAD OF STATE WILL ALSO STAY IN HIS OFFICE. THIS AFTERNOON PINOCHET WILL PROBABLY VISIT THE VOTE COUNTING CENTER OF THE INTERIOR MINISTRY ON MONATEGUI STREET. GOOD AFTERNOON.
DEV-MUC3-0988	SAN SALVADOR, 12 DEC 89 -- THE SALVADORAN RULING NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE PARTY TODAY SAID IT REGRETS THE DECISION OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT TO REJECT THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS IN COSTA RICA. ARENA PRESIDENT ARMANDO CALDERON SOL DESCRIBED THE FMLN'S RESPONSE TO THE DOCUMENT SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENTS AS "LAST-DITCH EFFORTS." CALDERON SAID THAT "THE FMLN CANNOT FIND A WAY TO USE THE POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED BY PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT." THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA MOVEMENT REJECTED THE COSTA RICAN AGREEMENTS WITH "INDIGNATION." IN THE AGREEMENTS, THE PRESIDENTS REQUEST THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE FMLN AND EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT. CALDERON SAID THAT THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT "WAS CONDEMNED AND FOR THAT REASON IT HAS NO OTHER CHOICE BUT TO CRITICIZE THE SUMMIT." CALDERON SOL ADDED THAT "THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS COULD ONLY EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE SALVADORAN DEMOCRACY." CALDERON SAID: "FOREIGN DEMOCRACIES MUST HELP THE SALVADORAN DEMOCRACY." THE SALVADORAN POLITICIAN SAID THAT IT IS "NOT TRUE THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT VIOLATES CIVILIANS' HUMAN RIGHTS," AS THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT CLAIMS. THE FMLN STATES THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN AGREEMENTS "UNCONDITIONALLY SUPPORT THE LEADING VIOLATOR OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE REGION, A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS MURDERED AND PERSECUTED THE CLERGY AND BOMBED THE CIVILIAN POPULATION." CALDERON SOL REPLIED THAT "THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT'S STATEMENTS ARE ANACHRONISTIC AND INTEND TO DISCREDIT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT."
DEV-MUC3-0989	SANTIAGO, 15 DEC 89 -- GOOD EVENING. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED A MAJOR PORTION OF THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTIONS HELD TODAY. AFTER 93 PERCENT OF THE VOTING STATIONS HAVE BEEN COUNTED, AND WHEN ALL THAT IS NEEDED IS THE OFFICIAL REPORT OF THE ELECTORAL COURT, IT IS POSSIBLE TO SAY THAT PATRICIO AYLWIN AZOCAR HAS BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC FOR THE L990-L994 TERM. WITH REGARD TO THAT RESULT THE SUPREME GOVERNMENT WOULD LIKE TO CONVEY TO THE PEOPLE THE FOLLOWING: 1. ALL CHILEANS SHOULD BE PROUD FOR ONCE AGAIN PARTICIPATING IN AN EXEMPLARY ELECTION. 2. ON BEHALF OF THE SUPREME GOVERNMENT, I WOULD LIKE TO CONVEY A DESERVED RECOGNITION TO THE ARMED FORCES AND CARABINEROS, WHO HAVE LED AN ELECTORAL PROCESS IN ORDER AND TRANQUILITY, AND TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATED TODAY AT THE VOTING STATIONS. THEY ENABLED THIS ELECTION TO BE HELD IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF PEACE, AND THEREBY ALLOWED THE FREE EXPRESSION OF CIVIC WILL. WE MUST, HOWEVER, REPUDIATE THE VIOLENT MURDER OF A MEMBER OF CARABINEROS. 3. THE PEOPLE MUST REST ASSURED THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT PINOCHET, FAITHFUL TO THE COMMITMENT MADE WITH THE ARMED FORCES AND POLICE, WILL HAVE THE RESULTS OF THE RECENT ELECTIONS RESPECTED. THE GOVERNMENT CALLS ON THE ENTIRE COUNTRY TO MAINTAIN PUBLIC ORDER, AND TO WAIT WITH TRANQUILITY THE FINAL RESULTS OF THIS ELECTION. 4. DURING THE LAST 16 YEARS CHILE HAS MOVED AHEAD SYSTEMATICALLY AND WITHOUT HESITATION TOWARD THE GREAT OBJECTIVES SET FORTH AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MILITARY GOVERNMENT. THE GOVERNMENT IS FULLY SATISFIED WITH THE WORK OF DEMOCRATIC, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL RECONSTRUCTION THAT WAS CARRIED OUT BY ALL CHILEANS UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT PINOCHET. WE HAVE SET FORTH A SOLID BASIS FOR FUTURE PROSPERITY. 5. THIS ELECTION FULFILLED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS FOR REACHING THE FULL DEMOCRACY THAT WAS DESTROYED IN THE PAST BY THE ENEMIES OF FREEDOM AND PLURALISM. AS HIS EXCELLENCY PRESIDENT PINOCHET SAID, 11 SEPTEMBER L973 NOT ONLY REPRESENTED THE OVERTHROW OF AN ILLEGIMATE AND FAILED GOVERNMENT, BUT IT ALSO REPRESENTED THE END OF A WORN OUT POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL REGIME, AND THE NEED TO BUILD A NEW ONE. IT WAS NOT JUST A TASK OF SIMPLE RESTORATION, BUT PRIMARILY A CREATIVE TASK WHICH, IN ORDER TO SUCCEED, HAD TO BE CARRIED OUT IN THE DEEP ROOTS OF NATIONAL TRADITION. 6. THE ARMED FORCES AND CARABINEROS FULFILLED THE COMMITMENT MADE IN SEPTEMBER L973. THE MISSION HAS BEEN FULFILLED. AUTHENTIC DEMOCRACY AS A WAY OF LIFE AND A FORM OF GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CREATED, AND THE TRANSITION PROCESS ENDS ON 11 MARCH L990. FROM NOW ON IT WILL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERY CHILEAN TO KEEP WATCH SO THAT THE STABILITY AND PROGRESS ACHIEVED WITH POLITICAL WILL AND CONSTANT EFFORT WILL CONTINUE TO PREVAIL IN OUR FREE SOCIETY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD NIGHT.
DEV-MUC3-0990	CLANDESTINE, 14 DEC 89 -- AFTER AN EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATION, THE SALVADORAN ARCHBISHOPRIC LEGAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE ISSUES THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT REGARDING THE MASSACRE OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS: THE OPERATION CARRIED OUT TO MURDER THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE TWO MAIDS LASTED LONGER THAN 1 HOUR. DURING ALL THAT TIME, THE PERPETRARORS FIRED THEIR WEAPONS AND DETONATED EXPLOSIVES. THIS WAS PROVED BY THE FINDING OF MANY SHELL CASINGS NEAR THE JESUITS' RESIDENCE. THE WITNESS' STATEMENTS ALSO CONFIRMED THAT THE WEAPONS WERE FIRED OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO COMMITTED THE CRIME WAS LARGE. THEY WERE WEARING ARMY UNIFORMS. THE WITNESS SAW APPROXIMATELY FIVE INDIVIDUALS WEARING ARMY UNIFORMS. THE WITNESS SAW THE MEN. SHE ALSO HEARD THE SHOOTING, THE CLOSING OF DOORS, AND THE BREAKING OF GLASS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE FACILITIES. THE WITNESS SAID THAT FIVE INDIVIDUALS ENTERED THE SERVANTS' ENTRANCE OF THE JESUITS' RESIDENCE. OTHER INDIVIDUALS ENTERED THE RESIDENCE BY THE DOOR LOCATED IN THE NORTHWESTERN END OF THE BUILDING, WHICH IS THE AREA WHERE THE PRIESTS HAVE THEIR ROOMS. ANOTHER GROUP ENTERED THE JESUIT CENTER, SEARCHED IT, AND BURNED IT WITH SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS SUCH AS FLAMETHROWERS. 3. THE SALVADORAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE, THE PERPETRATORS, KNEW THE JESUIT CENTER AND THE JESUIT RESIDENCE. IN OTHER WORDS, THEY KNEW THE UCA FACILITIES. ON MONDAY, 13 NOVEMBER, INDIVIDUALS WEARING ARMY UNIFORMS SPECIFICALLY SEARCHED THE JESUIT CENTER AND RESIDENCE. 4. THE SCENE OF THE CRIME IS LOCATED INSIDE AN ARMY CONTROL AND SECURITY AREA SINCE THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF IS LOCATED IN THAT SAME GENERAL AREA. THE ARMY MAINTAINS PERMANENT MILITARY SURVEILLANCE POSTS AT THE DEMOCRACIA BUILDING, THE MANUEL JOSE ARCE MILITARY NEIGHBORHOOD, THE NORTHERN UCA ENTRANCE, AT THE VARIOUS UCA SCHOOLS, AND AT LA CEIBA DE GUADALUPE AND JARDINES DE GUADALUPE NEIGHBORHOODS. ALL THOSE AREAS ARE WELL GUARDED BY SOLDIERS. 5. DESPITE THE EVIDENT AND VERIFIABLE MILITARIZATION OF THE AREA WHERE THE CRIME TOOK PLACE, THE CURFEW, THE EXTENDED AND HEAVY FIRING INSIDE THE UCA PREMISES, THE DETONATION OF EXPLOSIVES FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME DURING WHICH THE PERPETRATORS REMAINED INSIDE THE JESUIT FACILITIES -- WHICH GAVE THE PERPETRATORS TIME TO SEARCH THE JESUIT PRIESTS' ROOMS, KILL THEM ALONG WITH THE OTHER TWO VICTIMS, AND SEARCH AND BURN THE JESUIT CENTER CHURCH, THUS PROVING THE SIZE OF THE OPERATION -- THE ARMED FORCES DID NOT REACT AS THEY WOULD HAVE IF THIS OPERATION HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN . THIS INDICATES THAT THE SOLDIERS IN CHARGE OF SECURITY IN THE MANUEL JOSE ARCE MILITARY NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF INSTALLATIONS WERE AWARE OF THE OPERATION THAT WAS BEING CARRIED OUT. THEREFORE, THE ARCHBISHOPRIC'S LEGAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE CONCLUDES THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT MILITARY PERSONNEL OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE TWO MAIDS.
DEV-MUC3-0991	SAN SALVADOR, 14 DEC 89 -- THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS NOT PROPOSED TO THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT RESUMING DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR RELATIONS, PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI EXPLAINED ON 13 DECEMBER AT THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE. "I HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT UNILATERALLY NORMALIZING RELATIONS, NOR ARE WE THINKING OF DOING THIS UNLESS THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT COMPLIES WITH CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS THAT WE PRESENTED IN A DOCUMENT IN SAN JOSE," THE PRESIDENT SAID. IN A NEWS CONFERENCE HOSTED ON 12 DECEMBER, HE SAID THAT THE PRESIDENTS OF GUATEMALA, HONDURAS, AND COSTA RICA HAD URGED SOME TYPE OF DIALOGUE OR NEGOTIATIONS WITH ORTEGA TO SEEK NORMALIZING RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA, AND AS A RESULT HE PRESENTED THE DOCUMENTS WITH THE REQUIREMENTS. UNTIL THE AFTERNOON OF 13 DECEMBER, THE NICARAGUAN REGIME HAD NOT ANSWERED THE MINIMUM CONDITIONS FOR EL SALVADOR TO REESTABLISH OR NORMALIZE RELATIONS WITH MANAGUA. EL SALVADOR SUSPENDED ALL TYPES OF RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA ON 26 NOVEMBER, AFTER THE SALVADORAN ARMY DISCOVERED A PLANE COMING FROM MANAGUA WITH WEAPONS FOR THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT . CRISTIANI HAS INSISTED THAT "WITHOUT THE MATERIAL SUPPORT THAT THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT GIVES THE TERRORISTS OPERATING HERE, THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LAUNCH THE UNSUCCESSFUL OFFENSIVE OF 11 NOVEMBER IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER IMPORTANT CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY. THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, HE SHOWED ORTEGA A GREAT DEAL OF EVIDENCE OF THE NICARAGUAN INTERVENTION IN SALVADORAN AFFAIRS. HE ALSO SHOWED ALL THE PRESIDENTS A VIDEO IN WHICH MEMBERS OF THE FMLN ARE SHOWN RECEIVING TRAINING IN NICARAGUA, AND IN WHICH FMLN LEADERS SUCH AS JORGE SHAFIK HANDAL AND OTHERS ARE SHOWN RECEIVING INSTRUCTIONS IN MANAGUA, AND OTHER EVIDENCE. AFTER VIEWING SEVERAL MINUTES OF SUCH EVIDENCE, ORTEGA GOT UP AND TOLD THE PRESIDENTS HE WAS GOING TO MAKE A TELEPHONE CALL, BUT HE NEVER RETURNED TO THE ROOM, CRISTIANI SAID. "IN OTHER WORDS, ORTEGA WAS NEVER ABLE TO DENY HE IS SENDING WEAPONS AND HELP TO THE FMLN," THE PRESIDENT POINTED OUT.
DEV-MUC3-0992	MANAGUA , 15 DEC 89 -- NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA HAS CALLED ON THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TO RESPECT THE PEACE AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS. AT A MEETING WITH RESIDENTS OF NIQUINOMO, ORTEGA TALKED ABOUT THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENTS OF THE REGION DURING THE MEETING IN SAN ISIDRO DE CORONADO, COSTA RICA. THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED IN COSTA RICA ARE ANOTHER STEP FOWARD IN THE INTEREST OF PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA. HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT COMPLETELY SATISFIED, BECAUSE, AS I WAS TELLING THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS YESTERDAY, IT IS ONE THING TO AGREE ON SOMETHING AND SIGN AN AGREEMENT, BUT WHAT WE DO WHEN WE RETURN TO OUR COUNTRIES IS QUITE ANOTHER. THERE MUST BE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN WHAT IS SIGNED AND WHAT IS DONE. IF WE SIGN AN AGREEMENT AND PROMISE TO RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, THEN WE MUST RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS - - NOT KILL PRIESTS AND BRUTALLY REPRESS THE PEOPLE AS IN EL SALVADOR. IF WE AGREE THAT THE CONTRAS MUST BE DEMOBILIZED, THEN THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT MUST DO ITS PART TO ENSURE THAT THE CONTRAS ARE DEMOBILIZED. WE MUST DEMAND THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT RESPECT THE AGREEMENTS. THE PROBLEM WE FACE IS THAT AFTER EVERY PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT IS HELD AND AGREEMENTS ARE SIGNED, THE YANKEE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT RESPECT THEM AND CONTINUES TO DO AS IT PLEASES. I HOPE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WILL, ONCE AND FOR ALL, RESPECT THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS. THE UNITED STATES CAN SHOW ITS WILLINGNESS TO RESPECT THESE AGREEMENTS BY REFRAINING FROM HINDERING THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE FMLN AND THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE SEARCH FOR A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT. IF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS TRULY WILLING TO RESPECT THESE AGREEMENTS, THEN IT MUST NO LONGER GIVE THE CONTRAS MONEY TO MURDER THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE. LIKE THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS SAID, THAT MONEY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF SUPPORT AND VERIFICATION. ONLY IN THIS WAY WILL THE CONTRAS STOP BEING A THREAT TO THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE.

POLICE CHIEF GEN CARLOS CASADIEGO REPORTED THAT THE MEXICAN HAD DIED DURING AN OPERATION THAT BEGAN SEVERAL DAYS AGO. GEN CASADIEGO ADDED: "WE CONDUCTED A SURPRISE ATTACK.

DEV-MUC3-0996	BOGOTA, 15 DEC 89 -- THE NATIONAL POLICE, THROUGH GENERAL CARLOS ARTURO CASADIEGO, DEPUTY GENERAL DIRECTOR OF THAT INSTITUTION, INFORMED THE PRESS THIS AFTERNOON THAT THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE KILLED JOSE GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, A.K.A.

DEV-MUC3-0997	CARACAS , 15 DEC 89 -- THE COLOMBIAN 19 APRIL MOVEMENT HAS ASKED VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ FOR POLITICAL SUPPORT TO SECURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND THE GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO. EVERTH BUSTAMANTE, THE M-19'S INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS SECRETARY, SAID TODAY IN CARACAS THAT ON 14 DECEMBER HE INFORMED PEREZ ABOUT THE GRAVE POLITICAL CRISIS WHICH HAD EXPLODED IN HIS COUNTRY IN RECENT DAYS. THE RESIGNATION OF THE PRESIDENTS OF COLOMBIA'S TWO LARGEST POLITICAL PARTIES, AS WELL AS THE COLOMBIAN CONGRESS' POSITION IN FAVOR OF SUBMITTING TO A REFERENDUM THE RULING ON EXTRADITING DRUG TRAFFICKING SUSPECTS, IN DEFIANCE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION, HAS CREATED A POLITICAL VACUUM IN THE COUNTRY AND, BUSTAMANTE SAID, THE GOVERNMENT NO LONGER HAS A MONOPOLY OF POWER. THIS SITUATION, HE ADDED, CREATES DOUBTS ABOUT COMPLIANCE WITH THE AGREEMENT SIGNED IN NOVEMBER 1988 BY THE M-19 AND THE GOVERNMENT. IN LINE WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE REBELS WOULD SURRENDER THEIR WEAPONS. IN RECENT MONTHS THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT HAS MET ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE M-19 AND HAS PROPOSED THAT THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL RECEIVE THE ARMS OF THIS GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION WHICH WANTS TO JOIN COLOMBIA'S POLITICAL LIFE. BUSTAMANTE SAID THAT THE SITUATION THAT HAS EMERGED HAS IMPOSED A DELAY IN THE SURRENDERING THE WEAPONS WHICH HAD BEEN SCHEDULED FOR 19 DECEMBER. HE DID NOT GIVE A NEW DATE FOR THIS ACTION, BUT HE DID NOT DISCARD EITHER THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT COULD BE IN JANUARY OF NEXT YEAR. AN ACUTE POLITICAL CONFRONTATION EXPLODED IN COLOMBIA WHEN THE COLOMBIA CONGRESS DECIDED, AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT'S WILL, TO SUBMIT TO A REFERENDUM THE PRACTICE OF EXTRADITING DRUG TRAFFICKING SUSPECTS TO THE UNITED STATES SO THAT THEY MAY BE TRIED THERE. BUSTAMANTE NOTED: THIS MAKES IT EVIDENT THAT MANY LEGISLATORS SUPPORT THE DEMANDS OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS. BUSTAMANTE ADMITTED, HOWEVER, THAT THESE EXTRADITIONS VIOLATE COLOMBIA'S CONSTITUTION. ACCORDING TO THE M-19 LEADER, "THE ONLY WAY" OF OVERCOMING THE CURRENT POLITICAL CRISIS IS TO POSTPONE THE ELECTIONS SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE NEXT YEAR AND TO CONVOKE A CONSTITUENT NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND A REFERENDUM TO DECIDE ON CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS. THESE TWO POINTS FORM PART OF THE AGREEMENT SIGNED IN NOVEMBER 1988 BY THE M-19 AND THE GOVERNMENT. BUSTAMANTE, WHO LEAVES TOMORROW FOR MEXICO CITY AND LONDON, CALLED ON THE COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA GROUPS TO SURRENDER THEIR WEAPONS IF THE GOVERNMENT CONVOKES A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY.
DEV-MUC3-0998	SAN SALVADOR, 15 DEC 89 -- YESTERDAY, MARIA JULIA HERNANADEZ, DIRECTOR OF THE ARCHBISHOPRIC LEGAL ASSITANCE OFFICE, MADE OFFICIAL STATEMENTS BEFORE THE COURT REGARDING THE MURDER OF THE UCA PRIESTS. IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST ISSUED BY THE SALVADORAN 4TH CRIMINAL COURT, MARIA JULIA HERNANDEZ MADE STATEMENTS BEFORE THE COURT REGARDING THE MURDER OF SIX UCA JESUIT PRIESTS. THE PRIESTS WERE KILLED ON 16 NOVEMBER. ACCORDING TO HERNANDEZ, HER STATEMENT WAS PERSONAL AND SHE LIMITED HERSELF TO REPORTING ON THE INVESTIGATIONS SHE CONDUCTED AT UCA AFTER THE MURDER. IN HER STATEMENT, HERNANDEZ SAID THAT SHE FOUND FOUR BULLET CASINGS INSIDE UCA. THE PROSECUTORS THEN ALLEGED THAT SHE HAD COMMITTED A CRIME BY PICKING UP EVIDENCE. I MADE PERSONAL STATEMENTS AS A WITNESS. I TOLD THEM WHAT I SAW AND HEARD AT THE SITE OF THE CRIME. THAT IS WHAT I DID. THE PROSECUTORS ASKED ME ABOUT THE EVIDENCE I HAD GATHERED AT THE SITE OF THE CRIME. I PICKED UP FOUR BULLET CASINGS. THE PROSECUTORS SAID I HAD COMMITTED A CRIME. THAT IS, THEREFORE, THE CRIME I COMMITTED. ALTHOUGH SHE DID NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FACTS TO FORMULATE AN OPINION, HERNANDEZ SAID THAT AS AN INSTITUTION, THE ARCHBISHOPRIC LEGAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE BELIEVES THAT THE EVIDENCE, WHICH SHE DID NOT MENTION, INDICATES THAT ARMED FORCES MEMBERS, WHO REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS. THE CHURCH ALREADY ISSUED ITS OFFICIAL DOCUMENT CLEARLY STATING THAT THERE ARE ARMED FORCES MEMBERS INVOLVED IN THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS. ON WHAT DOES THE CHURCH BASE THAT ASSERTION? ON THE INVESTIGATIONS CONDUCTED BY THE ARCHBISHOPRIC LEGAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE. YES, BUT WHAT PROOF DOES THE CHURCH HAVE TO MAKE THAT ASSERTION? ALL THAT IS CONTAINED IN THE CHURCH DOCUMENT THAT WAS ALREADY RELEASED. YOU CAN GET THAT DOCUMENT IF YOU WANT. IN ADDITION, MARIA JULIA HERNANDEZ DENIED STATEMENTS MADE BY SOME MILITARY CHIEFS WHO SAID THAT WITNESS LUCIA CERNA, WHO IS OUT OF THE COUNTRY, WAS NEVER MANIPULATED OR PRESSURED. I WAS INTRODUCED TO MRS CERNA BY THE HEAD OF THE PROVINCIAL JESUIT ORDER ON MONDAY, 20 NOVEMBER. IN FRONT OF HIM, MRS CERNA MADE HER STATEMENT. AND SHE MADE THAT SAME STATEMENT BEFORE THE JUDGE AND THE PROSECUTORS AT THE SPANISH EMBASSY. THEY ARE WITNESSES TO THOSE STATEMENTS. IN OTHER WORDS, SHE MADE THE STATEMENT AT THE SPANISH EMBASSY BEFORE I MET HER. I COULD NOT HAVE MANIPULATED HER AT ALL. THE 4TH CRIMINAL COURT PROCEDURES REGARDING THIS CASE WILL CONTINUE IN ORDER TO TRY TO CLARIFY THE DEATH OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS INCLUDING IGNACIO ELLACURIA. CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADER FIDEL CHAVEZ MENA AND SAN SALVADOR AUXILIARY BISHOP MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ STILL HAVE TO MAKE THEIR STATEMENTS BEFORE THE COURT.
DEV-MUC3-0999	BOGOTA, 15 DEC 89 -- THE COLOMBIAN SENATE TODAY APPROVED A PARDON LAW THAT AUTHORIZES COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO TO "PARDON" OVER THE NEXT 6 MONTHS THE ARMED GROUPS THAT HAVE DEMONSTRATED THEIR DESIRE FOR PEACE. THE MEASURE INITIALLY FAVORS THE 19-APRIL MOVEMENT , WHICH PROMISED THE GOVERNMENT TO SURRENDER ITS WEAPONS AND GIVE UP VIOLENCE IN ORDER TO BECOME A POLITICAL PARTY. THE PARDON LAW IS ONE OF THE COMMITMENTS MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT IN THE AGREEMENT SIGNED WITH THE M-19 AS A RESULT OF THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT BEGAN LAST MARCH AND THAT SHOULD CONCLUDE WITH THE TOTAL DEMOBILIZATION OF THE M-19 AND THE DELIVERY OF ITS WEAPONS TO THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL. ONCE ITS MAIN LEADERS, AGAINST WHOM THERE ARE SERIOUS CHARGES FOR AGGRESSION AGAINST THE STATE, ARE PARDONED, THE M-19 WILL BECOME A LEGAL, POLITICAL GROUP. THE M-19 WAS SCHEDULED TO DELIVER ITS WEAPONS ON 19 DECEMBER, BUT THE ACTION WAS SUSPENDED UNTIL A DECISION IS MADE REGARDING THE AGREED UPON CREATION OF A "SPECIAL ELECTORAL DISTRICT, WHICH WOULD "GUARANTEE THE M-19" AN ACTIVE PRESENCE IN THE NATIONAL CONGRESS. THAT MEASURE, WHICH IS PART OF THE "PACKAGE" OF CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT, WAS SUSPENDED AT THE CONGRESS, WHICH COULD NOT REACH AN AGREEMENT ON IT BEFORE THE END OF ITS REGULAR SESSION. THE REFORMS ALSO INCLUDED THE HOLDING OF A REFERENDUM TO CONSULT THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE ON THE EXTRADITION ISSUE. LEGAL EXTRADITION WAS ADOPTED THROUGH AN ADMINISTRATIVE MEASURE IN ORDER TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING. THE COLOMBIAN CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES' APPROVAL OF THE INCLUSION OF THE EXTRADITION ISSUE IN THE REFERENDUM CAUSED A POLITICAL CRISIS WITH THE RESIGNATION OF THE PRESIDENTS OF THE LIBERAL AND CONSERVATIVE PARTIES. TODAY THE PLENUM OF THE COLOMBIAN CONGRESS DID NOT APPROVE THE HOLDING OF A PLEBISCITE IN SEPTEMBER 1990, IN WHICH THE VOTERS WOULD DECIDE TO EITHER APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE THE EXTRADITION OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS, BECAUSE OF THE RESIGNATIONS OF FORMER PRESIDENTS JULIO CESAR TURBAY AYALA AND MISAEL PASTRANA BORRERO, LEADERS OF THE LIBERAL AND CONSERVATIVE PARTIES, RESPECTIVELY. TODAY, IN ADDITION TO THE DECISION MADE IN CONGRESS, WHICH ALONG WITH THE CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES WILL CLOSE ITS REGULAR SESSION PERIOD ON 17 DECEMBER, GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, A.K.A THE MEXICAN, ONE OF THE MOST WANTED COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND THE NUMBER-TWO MAN IN THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, WAS KILLED DURING A CLASH WITH THE POLICE.
DEV-MUC3-1000	NO CITY , NO DATE -- GENERAL, WHO CONDUCTED THE OPERATIONS -- THE ELITE FORCES, THE SPECIAL OPERATIONS GROUP ...HOW MANY UNITS PARTICIPATED IN THIS ACTION? IT WAS A STRIKE THAT WAS CONDUCTED BY A SPECIALIZED GROUP, BUT THE WORK WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY ALL DEPARTMENTS OF THE NATIONAL POLICE IN GENERAL. THIS WORK WAS UNDERTAKEN BY ALL THOSE WHO ARE IN CHARGE OF FIGHTING DRUG TRAFFICKING. HOW WAS THE GOVERNMENT AND PRESIDENT INFORMED ABOUT THIS? JUST AS I AM REPORTING IT TO YOU. I TOLD THE PRESIDENT THAT WE HAD IDENTIFIED RODRIGUEZ GACHA, HIS SON, AND 15 OTHERS AFTER THE OPERATION WAS CARRIED OUT. WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT TELL YOU AFTER YOU GAVE HIM THE NEWS? IT WAS SIMPLY A NATIONAL POLICE REPORT TO THE PRESIDENT. LATER ON, WE WILL PROVIDE HIM WITH THE DETAILS AFTER THE INSPECTORS RETURN. WHAT ELSE DID YOU FIND IN THE AREA WHERE THE OPERATION WAS CARRIED OUT? DID YOU FIND WEAPONS? WERE SOME PEOPLE ABLE TO ESCAPE? NO, I HAVE NO MORE DETAILS. WE ARE JUST RECEIVING THE INFORMATION OVER THE RADIO, AND WE CANNOT GIVE DETAILS OVER THE RADIO. WHAT CAN WE EXPECT IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES REGARDING THIS INFORMATION? WITHOUT DOUBT, THIS INFORMATION WILL BE ANNOUNCED WITH FULLER DETAILS BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL POLICE. THE GENERALS AND THE NATIONAL POLICE STAFF ARE MEETING HERE. WE ARE GOING TO CONDUCT A SERIES OF OPERATIONS TO CONSOLIDATE THE AREA AND TO DO WHAT THE LAW REQUIRES. WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER MAJOR DRUG CARTEL LEADERS? WE ARE DOING OUR JOB AND THIS IS PROOF THAT WE ARE DOING OUR JOB. I BELIEVE THAT COLOMBIA MUST CONGRATULATE THE NATIONAL POLICE FOR THE JOB THEY HAVE DONE. GENERAL, YOU HAVE SAID THE AREA IS BEING REINFORCED. DOES THIS MEAN MORE NATIONAL POLICE TROOPS ARE BEING DEPLOYED TO THE AREA? WILL THE OPERATIONS CONTINUE IN SEARCH OF OTHER DRUG CARTEL LEADERS? WE ARE SEARCHING AND BLOCKING OFF THE AREA. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING. IS THAT THE REPORT THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE RELEASED TO THE GOVERNMENT AND TO COLOMBIANS? THAT IS THE REPORT WE HAVE RELEASED TO THEM, AND WE ASK ALL CITIZENS TO CONTINUE COOPERATING WITH US. THEY CAN BE SURE THAT WE WILL TRY TO SIGNIFICANTLY CUT THE NUMBER OF CRIMES BEING COMMITTED.

THE GOVERNOR OF SUCRE TOLD THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT PABLO ESCOBAR IS IN THE SAME AREA WHICH HAS BEEN SURROUNDED AND ALL FLIGHTS HAVE BEEN RESTRICTED.

FOR A LONG TIME, THE NATIONAL POLICE IN COLLABORATION WITH THE DAS AND OTHER STATE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAVE BEEN GATHERING INTELLIGENCE DATA WHICH TODAY HAS YIELDED POSITIVE RESULTS. HOW MANY POLICEMEN PARTICIPATED IN THE OPERATION? SEVERAL SPECIALIZED UNITS OF THE NATIONAL POLICE PARTICIPATED IN THE OPERATION ALONG WITH THE POLICE IN CORDOBA AND SUCRE DEPARTMENTS. ARE THERE ANY POLICEMEN WOUNDED? WE DO NOT KNOW OF ANY POLICEMEN BEING WOUNDED. HOW LONG DID THE CLASH BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE BODYGUARDS OR BETWEEN THE POLICE AND THE DEAD KILLED LAST? RIGHT NOW WE DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY HOW LONG THE CLASH WAS. ARE THE CORPSES STILL AT THE SITE OF THE INCIDENT OR WILL THEY BE IMMEDIATELY TRANSFERRED TO BOGOTA? WE HAVE SENT CRIMINAL ARRAIGNMENT JUDGES THERE, AS WELL AS NATIONAL POLICE INSPECTORS. THE JUDGES WILL DECIDE WHAT TO DO. HOW WAS IT CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA? BASED ON MEANS WE HAVE OF CONFIRMING HIS IDENTITY.

DEV-MUC3-1009	CLANDESTINE, 18 DEC 89 -- THIS IS A COMMUNIQUE FROM THE GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FMLN TO ALL SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND TO OUR HEROIC LEADERS AND FIGHTERS: ON 11 NOVEMBER, ALL OF OUR FORCES BEGAN THE MAJOR NATIONAL OFFENSIVE THAT GAVE A STRATEGIC TURN TO THE WAR. OUR FIGHTERS HAVE CARRIED OUT COUNTLESS HEROIC AND DARING ACTS SINCE THEM. NEITHER THE CONCENTRATION OF THE ELITE BATTALIONS IN SAN SALVADOR NOR THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF U.S. MILITARY ASSISTANCE OR FULL RANGE OF U.S. TECHNOLOGY AND EXPERIENCE COULD PREVENT OUR FORCES FROM ENTERING AND OCCUPYING EXTENSIVE URBAN AREAS AND ORGANIZING STRATEGIC HARASSMENT OF THE CITY. OUR HEROIC FIGHTERS ASSAULTED THE COUNTRY'S FIVE MAJOR VITAL CENTERS -- SAN SALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL, SANTA ANA, USULUTAN, AND ZACATECOLUCA. BEGINNING ON THE 11TH, THE WAR THEATRE IRREVERSIBLY MOVED FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE TO THE MAIN CITIES. TO POSTPONE IMMINENT COLLAPSE AND TO STOP A PEOPLE'S UPRISING, THE FATALLY WOUNDED MILITARY LEADERSHIP AND THE FASCIST GOVERNMENT ORDERED THAT THE LOW-INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS BE BOMBARDED. THEY DID NOT CARE HOW MANY CIVILIAN LIVES IT WOULD COST. WITH ALL OF ITS ELITE AND REGULAR BATTALIONS, THE ENEMY ARMY WAS REDUCED TO THE DEFENSIVE AND TO GUARDING THE CITIES. EXTENSIVE AREAS AROUND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY ARE LIBERATED TERRITORY. THE WAR IS NOW WHERE IT CAN BE DEFINED -- IN THE VITAL CENTERS. THERE IS NO WAY THE OLIGARCHS' EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC PROGRAM CAN TAKE OFF AND THE FASCIST GOVERNMENT OF ARENA , WITH ITS GENOCIDAL BRUTALITY UNMASKED, IS INTERNATIONALLY ISOLATED AND HATED BY THE PEOPLE FOR ITS CRIMES. THIS GREAT EFFORT OF AUDACITY AND HEROISM THAT BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER HAS PLACED THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP AND THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION IN THEIR MOST CRITICAL POSITION OF THE 9 YEARS OF WAR. THUS FAR, DURING THIS EXTRAORDINARY EFFORT -- WHICH HAS GIVEN TO EL SALVADOR AND THE WORLD REAL HOPE FOR DEMOCRACY AND PEACE FOR OUR COUNTRY -- 401 OF THE MOST GENEROUS AND BRAVE SONS OF OUR HOMELAND HAVE FALLEN IN COMBAT. THIS LIST IS HEADED BY OUR DEAR AND UNFORGETTABLE COMRADE COMMANDER DIMAS RODRIGUEZ, TO WHOM WE OWE DECISIVE CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE CONDUCT OF OUR STRUGGLE TOWARD VICTORY. THE FOLLOWING MILITARY COMMANDERS WHO FELL IN COMBAT ALSO MADE A CONTRIBUTION: JORGE ORLANDO SANDOVAL CERVELLON, COMMANDER OSCAR; JEHOVA VASQUEZ, COMMANDER CIRILO; OVIDIO LOPEZ, COMMANDER ORLANDO MORALES; COMMANDER MISAEL GALLARDO; COMMANDER NICOLAS ALBERTO SARAVIA, WILBERT; COMMANDER RICARDO MIRANDA, ESTEBAN RUIZ; AND THE COMMANDER ODIR POLITICAL DIRECTORS -- JOSE SANTOS YANEZ, PEPE; AND MILAGRO ALVARADO, JUDY. WE RELEASE THE NAMES OF THESE HEROES IN ORDER FOR THE PEOPLE TO REGISTER THEM ETERNALLY IN THE HIGHEST PLACE IN OUR HISTORY. THEIR DEVOTION MULTIPLIES AND STRENGTHENS THE PEOPLE'S POWER. HUNDREDS OF NEW FIGHTERS ALREADY HAVE THE WEAPONS AND ENTHUSIASM OF THOSE WHO HAVE FALLEN. THEY ARE AT THE FRONTLINE OF THIS POWER OF THE FUTURE WHICH IS BUILDING, BEFORE THE WORLD'S ADMIRING EYES, DEMOCRATIC AND JUST EL SALVADOR. ALONGSIDE OUR HEROES, THOUSANDS OF OTHER SALVADORANS HAVE FERTILIZED THE PATH TO PEACE WITH THEIR BLOOD, VICTIMS OF THE FATALLY WOUNDED BEAST -- THE FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION) UNION MEMBERS, THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE ANONYMOUS PEOPLE MASSACRED IN THE GENOCIDAL BOMBINGS. THE REALIZATION OF A GENUINE AND DEFINITIVE CHANGE IS ENSURED BY THE GREAT POWER OF OUR REVOLUTIONARY ARMY, OF ALL OF OUR PEOPLE, AND OF WORLD SOLIDARITY. THOSE WHO FELL TAUGHT TO US THE COURAGE AND DETERMINATION TO FINISH THIS EXTRAORDINARY EFFORT, TO CONQUER WHAT WE THINK THE PEOPLE JUSTLY DESERVE -- DEMOCRACY, PROGRESS, AND PEACE. ETERNAL GLORY TO THE HEROES AND MARTYRS, BUILDERS OF DEMOCRACY AND PEACE. THE OFFENSIVE CONTINUES, VICTORY IS NEAR. FMLN GENERAL COMMAND; COMMANDERS SALVADOR SANCHEZ CEREN, JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, EDUARDO SANCHO, FRANCISCO JOVEL, AND SHAFIK JORGE HANDAL. 18 DECEMBER 1989, EL SALVADOR
DEV-MUC3-1010	CLANDESTINE, 12 DEC 89 -- THE FIRST QUESTION WE ASK COMRADE LEO CABRAL IS: WHAT ARE THE RESULTS OF THE OFFENSIVE AFTER 1 MONTH? TODAY, 11 DECEMBER, AFTER 1 MONTH OF A GLORIOUS AND VICTORIOUS OFFENSIVE, WE HAVE SOME THOUGHTS REGARDING THIS LATEST FIGHT. WE WANT TO STRESS THAT ALL OUR OFFENSIVES HAVE CENTERED AROUND THE MAIN CITIES IN OUR COUNTRY. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS STRUGGLE BY THE PEOPLE AND THE FMLN IS HAVING MAINTAINED THE BESIEGEMENT ON THE MOST IMPORTANT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC POINTS, MOST ESPECIALLY ON THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL. THERE HAS BEEN GREAT PRESSURE IN THE CASE OF SAN SALVADOR, AND THE FMLN HAS FORCED THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, COLONEL PONCE, AND THE FASCIST HIGH COMMAND TO CHANGE THEIR STRATEGIC TACTICS THREE TIMES. YOU WILL RECALL THAT THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF FIRST TRIED TO DISLODGE THE FMLN FORCES THAT HAD ENTERED SINCE THE EVENING OF 11 NOVEMBER. WHEN THE FIRST PUPPET ARMY STRATEGIC DEFENSE TACTIC FAILED, THEY THEN TRIED TO ISOLATE THE FMLN FORCES FROM ONE ANOTHER AND ANNIHILATE THEM ONE BY ONE. FOR THIS, THEY CONCENTRATED SPECIAL FORCES, ESPECIALLY USING ELITE BATTALIONS, IN A SIEGE MODALITY FOR ANNIHILATION. THIS ALSO FAILED. FACED WITH THE SECOND FAILURE OF THEIR SPECIAL TACTICS TO END THE OFFENSIVE IN A FEW DAYS, AS CRISTIANI AND THE HIGH MILITARY COMMAND HAD SAID, THEY MOVED A GREAT NUMBER OF OPERATIONAL FORCES FROM THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR, SUCH AS THE ELITE BATTALIONS, TO SET UP AN EXTENSIVE SIEGE TO DEFEND THE CAPITAL CITY AND PREVENT OUR FORCES FROM ENTERING IT. AS ALL OUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE -- AND INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION HAS ALSO BEEN ABLE TO VERIFY THIS THROUGH A GREAT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION FLOWING THROUGH INTERNATIONAL REPORTERS -- THAT SIEGE TO KEEP OUT THE FMLN HAS ALSO FAILED. THIS MEANS MORE VICTORIES AND SUCCESSES, SUCH AS INCURSIONS INTO THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE SOUTHERN AREA OF ANTIGUO CUSCATLAN, AND TWO IMPORTANT ATTACKS ON THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF. RIGHT NOW WE SEE THAT THE PUPPET ARMY'S SPECIAL CITY OPERATION IS THEIR THIRD AND LAST PLAN. THEY HAVE FORMED FOUR COMMANDS TO CONTROL THE CITY, WHICH WILL ALSO BE DEFEATED BY OUR FMLN MILITARY FORCES. WE ALSO MUST ADD TO THIS LIST OF ACHIEVEMENTS THAT THE GREAT CONCENTRATION OF ENEMY ARMY OPERATIONAL FORCES IN THE CAPITAL HAS CAUSED A GREAT NATIONAL IMBALANCE IN FORCES. THIS MEANS THAT EXTENSIVE AREAS OF THE COUNTRY ARE WITHOUT THE PROTECTION OF THE PUPPET TROOPS. WE HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THIS AND HAVE WORKED ON ORGANIZING THE PEOPLE AND RAISING A PEOPLE'S POWER, AN ALTERNATIVE TO LOCAL REACTIONARY POWER. WE ALSO RECORD AS A SUCCESSFUL OFFENSIVE DURING THIS FIRST MONTH THE FACT THAT OUR ENEMY'S INTELLIGENCE WORK HAS BEEN COMPLETELY SMASHED. THE SEARCHES, WHICH HAVE BEEN ENTRUSTED IN AN IMPROVISED MANNER TO MILITARY TROOPS CONCENTRATED IN THE CITIES, ESPECIALLY THE REPRESSIVE CORPS, HAVE ATTEMPTED TO RESTORE ALL THE INTELLIGENCE DATA BANKS TO BE ABLE TO TRY AND DESTROY THE PEOPLE'S STRUGGLE. WE MUST ALSO RECORD AS ONE OF THE SUCCESSES OF OUR GENERAL OFFENSIVE DURING THIS FIRST MONTH THE FACT THAT THE PUPPET ARMY WAS FORCED TO ABORT ANOTHER PLAN. EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE SOME BLOODY EVENTS, SUCH AS THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, ALONG WITH A GREAT AMOUNT OF KIDNAPPINGS AND MISSING PEOPLE AND ARRESTS OF MEMBERS OR LEADERS OF GRASSROOT PEOPLE'S MOVEMENTS, WE FEEL THAT THE ARMY AND REPRESSIVE CORPS ARE INCAPABLE OF ATTENDING TO THE FMLN OFFENSIVE AND THE BESIEGEMENT AT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO CARRY OUT THEIR ANNIHILATION OF THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT. SO THIS IS ANOTHER SUCCESS.
DEV-MUC3-1011	SAN SALVADOR, 12 DEC 89 -- MANY POLITICAL, UNION, UNIVERSITY, RELIGIOUS, AND CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN "BEHEADED" BY THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS A MONTH AGO, BY THE ARMY'S RESPONSE TO THE OFFENSIVE, AND BY EXTREMIST GROUPS' RETALIATORY ACTIONS. THESE ORGANIZATIONS -- MOST OF WHICH ACTIVELY FAVORED A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN WAR -- HAVE BEEN LEFT WITHOUT MAIN LEADERS BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO PARTY MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS, THEY HAVE BEEN KILLED, FORCED TO HIDE OR LEAVE THE COUNTRY FOR "SECURITY REASONS" THE JESUIT CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY'S MAIN LEADERS WERE MURDERED. ACCORDING TO RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION SOURCES, APPROXIMATELY 50 PRIESTS -- SALVADORAN AND FOREIGNERS -- HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY FELT "PERSECUTED" BY THE ARMY WHICH LINKS THEM TO THE GUERRILLAS. THE EDITORIAL OF THE 15 DECEMBER EDITION OF "PROCESO" -- A UCA WEEKLY PUBLICATION -- ASSERTS THAT THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS ON UCA PREMISES ON 16 NOVEMBER, OCCURRED AT THE SAME TIME WHEN SEVERAL CHURCHES AND UNION HEADQUARTERS WERE BEING SEARCHED BY "PEOPLE IN UNIFORMS." "PROCESO" MANTAINS THAT "APPARENTLY, THEY WANTED TO STRIKE ONE SINGLE BLOW AND BEHEAD EVERY ORGANIZATION LABELED BY GOVERNMENT PROPAGANDA AS AN FMLN FACADE." HOWEVER, SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI SAID BEFORE HE LEFT TO ATTEND A CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT IN COSTA RICA, THAT HIS GOVERNMENT DOES NOT PERSECUTE RELIGIOUS LEADERS. THREE DAYS AFTER THE GUERRILLAS STARTED THEIR LARGEST OFFENSIVE IN THE DECADE -- ON 14 NOVEMBER -- GUILLERMO UNGO AND HECTOR OQUELI, THE MAIN LEFTIST OPPOSITION LEADERS, LEFT EL SALVADOR, SAYING THAT THEY HAD RECEIVED DEATH THREATS IN MESSAGES BROADCAST OVER THE GOVERNMENT'S RADIO NETWORK. LEADERS OF THE GENERAL CONFEDERATION OF WORKERS -- WHICH IS LINKED TO THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY -- HAVE REPORTED THAT THEY ARE BEING PERSECUTED AND BLAME THE ARMY AND THE GUERRILLAS FOR "VIOLATING HUMAN RIGHTS." CGT LEADER JOSE LUIS GRANDE PREZA ASSERTED THAT "TO RECUPERATE AND MANTAIN THEIR PRIVILEGES, THE EXTREME RIGHTISTS HAVE UNSCRUPULOUSLY TURNED THE ARMY AGAINST ITS OWN PEOPLE AND GENERATED REPRESSION AND PERSECUTION AGAINST THE CHURCH, THE OPPOSITION, AND UNION MOVEMENTS." BEFORE LEAVING FOR GUATEMALA TO OBTAIN SUPPORT FOR A CEASE-FIRE IN EL SALVADOR, GRANDE PREZA SAID THE GUERRILLAS "VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE NAME OF REVOLUTION" AND THAT "EACH SIDE JUSTIFIES ITS VIOLENCE, BUT THE ONLY TRUTH IS THAT THE PEOPLE ALWAYS END UP BURYING THE DEAD." LUDOVICO SAMAYOA, DEPUTY OF THE MAIN OPPOSITION CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY , ASSERTED THAT TWO PDC MUNICIPAL OFFICIALS IN ILOBASCO HAD BEEN ARRESTED BY ARMY MEMBERS IN THE PAST FEW DAYS. ILOBASCO IS LOCATED 60 KM NORTHEAST OF SAN SALVADOR. "THE GOVERNMENT HAS INITIATED A GENERALIZED REPRESSION TO DISMANTLE THE PARTY AND FRIGHTEN OUR MEMBERS WITH THESE ARRESTS," SAID SAMAYOA. HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION COORDINATOR MIGUEL MONTENEGRO SAID THAT HIS OFFICE, AS WELL AS OTHER OFFICES OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT OPPOSE THE GOVERNMENT, "WERE SEARCHED AND DESTROYED BY BOMBS" IN THE EASTERN CITY OF SAN MIGUEL. IGNACIO ELLACURIA, ONE OF THE SIX JESUITS MURDERED ON 16 NOVEMBER, FOUNDER OF "PROCESO" AND UCA DIRECTOR, HAD NOTED A FEW MONTHS BEFORE HIS DEATH THAT "THE SALVADORAN POLITICAL PROCESS HAD ENTERED A NEW PHASE OF MODERATION AND FLEXIBILITY WITH THE INCREASE OF POLITICAL SPACES." IN CONTRAST THE EDITORIAL THAT APPEARS IN THE NEXT EDITION OF "PROCESO" STRESSES: "IT IS THE HOUR OF THE LONG KNIVES. THE MALESTROM OF BLOOD THAT HAS COME UPON THE COUNTRY IN THE PAST MONTH HAS SHRED TO PIECES THE PHASE OF MODERATION IN WHICH THE MAIN PARTICIPANTS OF THE SALVADORAN POLITICAL PROCESS HAD BEEN INVOLVED."
DEV-MUC3-1012	RIO DE JANEIRO , 18 DEC 89 -- THE KIDNAPPERS OF BUSINESSMAN ABILIO DINIZ WILL REMAIN AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE SAO PAULO POLICE FOR 10 DAYS. THE BUSINESSMAN WAS KIDNAPPED ON 11 DECEMBER AND RELEASED ON 17 DECEMBER. ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE ALSO HELPING TO CLARIFY THE KIDNAPPING OF ANOTHER BUSINESSMAN, LUIS SALES.
DEV-MUC3-1013	SAN SALVADOR, 19 DEC 89 -- A FEW MONTHS AGO, IT WAS SPECULATED THAT CHANGES OF COMMAND IN CERTAIN ARMED FORCES KEY POSTS WOULD TAKE PLACE LATE IN 1989. COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, JOINT CHIEF OF STAFF, DISREGARDED THIS POSSIBILITY AND SAID THAT THE SITUATION OF VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY, PARTICULARLY SINCE THE FMLN OFFENSIVE, REQUIRES, MORE THAN EVER, THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE MILITARILY STABLE. I THINK THE SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY DEMANDS MILITARY STABILITY. CHANGES COULD PROVOKE SOME UNREST. WE THINK NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE MILITARY COMMAND SHOULD BE MADE AT PRESENT BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT SITUATION. SHOULD ANY CHANGES BE MADE, IT WOULD BE FOR MAJOR REASONS IN THE SERVICE. NO HIGH-LEVEL CHANGES HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED, HOWEVER. REFERRING TO THE REBELS' ACTIVITIES, COL PONCE SAID THE ARMED ACTIONS INITIATED, PARTICULARLY IN SAN SALVADOR ON 11 NOVEMBER, HAVE ENDED WITH UNFAVORABLE RESULTS FOR THE GUERRILLAS. HE ADVISED, HOWEVER, THAT THE GUERRILLAS WILL CONTINUE TO SABOTAGE THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY AND PERPETRATE TERRORIST ACTIONS. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE FMLN HAS FAILED, MILITARILY SPEAKING. THE FMLN'S FAMOUS ALL - THE - WAY OFFENSIVE HAS ENDED IN TREMENDOUS FAILURE, DETERMINED BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. WE CAN ANTICIPATE THAT THE FMLN WILL CONTINUE ITS SABOTAGING ACTIONS AND TERRORISM WHICH COULD DESTROY STORES IN SAN SALVADOR, AS WELL AS POSTS AND PYLONS ON HIGHWAYS. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE CAN REST ASSURED, HOWEVER, THAT AN OFFENSIVE ACTION BY THE FMLN AT PRESENT CAN BE DISREGARDED. REGARDING THE CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR FESTIVITIES, WHICH HAVE BEEN MARRED BY THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE, MANY PEOPLE HAVE WONDERED WHETHER THE 2300 - TO - 0500 CURFEW IS STILL IN FORCE. PONCE SAID THE POSSIBILITY OF LIFTING THE CURFEW AT LEAST ON 24 AND 31 DECEMBER IS BEING CONSIDERED SO THAT THE SALVADORAN FAMILIES CAN ENJOY THESE FESTIVITIES. HE ADDED THAT SUCH A MEASURE, HOWEVER, WILL DEPEND ON THE FMLN'S STANCE. FINALLY, PONCE REPORTED THAT THE FMLN MACHINEGUNNED A BUILDING WITH COFFEE HARVESTERS IN SANTA ANA AND MAIMED TWO PEOPLE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY REFUSED TO STOP HARVESTING COFFEE.
DEV-MUC3-1014	BOGOTA, 20 DEC 89 -- MEDICAL SPOKESMEN OF THE SANTO TOMAS HOSPITAL HAVE ACCUSED THE U.S. INVADING TROOPS OF PREVENTING AMBULANCES FROM TRANSITING AND PROVIDING MEDICAL ATTENTION TO THE MANY WOUNDED IN STRATEGIC SECTORS OF THE PANAMANIAN CAPITAL. JORGE DIAZ, MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF THE HOSPITAL, TOLD THE COLOMBIAN RADIO STATION CARACOL THAT THE FOREIGN SOLDIERS ARE FIRING MACHINEGUNS AT AMBULANCES THAT ARE PASSING THOUGH THE CITY. ACCORDING TO THE DOCTOR, THE HOSPITAL, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IN PANAMA, HAS RECEIVED ABOUT 50 DEAD, WHILE OVER 100 ARE RECOVERING FROM SERIOUS WOUNDS. HE SAID THAT ONLY SIX OR SEVEN MEMBERS OF THE DEFENSE FORCES HAVE BEEN TAKEN THERE; THUS MOST OF THE VICTIMS ARE INHABITANTS OF LOW-INCOME AREAS SHELLED BY U.S. AIRPLANES. "FROM THE SANTO TOMAS HOSPITAL, WE HEARD THE BOMB EXPLOSIONS. MANY HOMES ARE ON FIRE, BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN AN INDISCRIMINATE ATTACK," DIAZ SAID. SIMILARLY, ALFONSO ZAMORA, DPA CORRESPONDENT IN PANAMA CITY, SAID DRAMATICALLY TO THE COLOMBIAN STATION: "WE ARE ON THE FLOOR." HE SAID THE EXCHANGE OF FIRE HAS INTENSIFIED IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CAPITAL.
DEV-MUC3-1015	QUITO, 20 DEC 89 -- ECUADOR TODAY CONDEMNED THE U.S. MILITARY FORCES' ACTION IN PANAMA, WHICH IT DESCRIBED AS A "FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL PRINCIPLES," BUT SAID THAT IT WAS GENERAL MANUEL NORIEGA'S "UNDEMOCRATIC STUBBORNNESS THAT CAUSED THE SITUATION TO DETERIORATE TO THIS POINT." IN A COMMUNIQUE READ BY FOREIGN MINISTER DIEGO CORDOVEZ, WHO WAS HEAD OF THE OAS MISSION THAT TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY TO MEDIATE IN PANAMA'S POLITICAL CRISIS, THE ECUADORAN GOVERNMENT DEMANDED AN IMMEDIATE END TO THE "FOREIGN INTERVENTION" AND "FULL RESPECT FOR PANAMANIAN INTEGRITY AND SOVEREIGNTY." HOWEVER, THE ECUADORAN GOVERNMENT CONSIDERED IT "ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY" THAT A "DEMOCRATIC REGIME" RESTORE INSTITUTIONAL NORMALCY IN PANAMA AND GUARANTEE RESPECT FOR THE TORRIJOS - CARTER TREATIES. AFTER A PRIVATE MEETING WITH PRESIDENT RODRIGO BORJA, CORDOVEZ REITERATED THE OFFICIAL OFFER TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY NEGOTIATING EFFORTS THAT MIGHT BE INITIATED "TO RESOLVE THE CONFLICT IN PANAMA." BY MANDATE OF THE ASSEMBLY OF AMERICAN FOREIGN MINISTERS, IN MAY AND AUGUST CORDOVEZ HEADED EFFORTS TO FIND A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS GENERATED BY THE REGIME'S ANNULMENT OF THE 7 MAY ELECTIONS, PRESUMABLY TO PREVENT WHAT WAS ANNOUNCED AS A CLEAR OPPOSITION VICTORY. "INTENSIVE EFFORTS WERE MADE TO PREVENT THE CONFLICT THAT HAS EXPLODED TODAY," CORDOVEZ SAID. HE REITERATED HIS "BROADEST WILLINGNESS" TO "CONTINUE SUPPORTING THE SEARCH FOR A NONVIOLENT SOLUTION."
DEV-MUC3-1016	LIMA, 20 DEC 89 -- THE PANAMANIAN CHARGE D'AFFAIRS IN OUR COUNTRY, JAIME CERDA, DID NOT MAKE AN URGENT CALL TO ALL LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLE TO REPUDIATE THE U.S. INTERVENTION IN HIS COUNTRY. WE DEFINITELY CALL ON THE WORLD, ON THE CONSCIENCE OF THE WORLD, TO END THIS SITUATION. IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT THE TORRIJOS-CARTER TREATY COULD BE ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS FOR THIS CONFLICT THAT HAS BEEN BREWING FOR SOME TIME BETWEEN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE PANAMANIAN STATE. DO YOU BELIEVE, AS A CITIZEN, THAT THERE IS A SHORT-TERM SOLUTION TO THIS CONFLICT? THAT WOULD DEPEND ON THE GOOD FAITH OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TOWARD PANAMANIANS. I BELIEVE THAT NO PEOPLE, NO MAN, INDEPENDENTLY OF WHAT HE MAY THINK OF THE GOVERNMENTS, CAN AGREE WITH THIS TYPE OF INTERVENTION BY THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL POWER DIRECTED AGAINST A SMALL PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO CONFRONT THE MILITARY MIGHT OF THE UNITED STATES. ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL PRESS AGENCIES REPORTS, CIVILIANS ARE BEING KILLED THERE ARE MANY MILITIAMEN WHO ARE FIGHTING THE U.S. SOLDIERS. I REITERATE MY CALL TO THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD, ON THE LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLE, ON OUR PERUVIAN BROTHERS TO DECLARE THEMSELVES AGAINST THIS ACT OF AGGRESSION THAT CANNOT BE TOLERATED BY FREE NATIONS. IN PANAMA, WHERE ARE THE CLASHES TAKING PLACE? IN PANAMA CITY. INTERNATIONAL PRESS DISPATCHES HAVE MENTIONED THIS. WHAT IS THE SOCIAL COST SO FAR? IS THERE SOME ESTIMATE? WELL, INTERNATIONAL DISPATCHES SPEAK OF 50 DEAD, MOSTLY CIVILIANS. FROM THE SANTO TOMAS HOSPITAL, WHICH IS A PUBLIC HEALTH HOSPITAL, THERE HAS BEEN NO INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT BEEN GIVEN MEDICAL ATTENTION, NOR FROM OTHER HOSPITALS.
DEV-MUC3-1017	SAN SALVADOR, 20 DEC 89 -- MILITARY AND CIVILIAN SOURCES HAVE CONFIRMED THAT HEAVY FIGHTING BETWEEN REBELS AND SOLDIERS BROKE OUT THIS EVENING IN CIUDAD MERLIOT, AN AREA WEST OF SAN SALVADOR. THE FIGHTING BEGAN AT 1830 WHEN FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT COLUMNS ENTERED CIUDAD MERLIOT, A MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 12 KM SOUTHWEST OF SAN SALVADOR. ACCORDING TO POLICE SOURCES, THE FIGHTING WAS REPORTED IN THE AREAS OF JARDINES DE LA HACIENDA AND JARDINES DEL VOLCAN, WHERE THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS ARE USING AIR SUPPORT. THE HELICOPTERS FIRED ROCKETS AGAINST SUPPOSED REBEL POSITIONS. THE SHOOTING COULD BE HEARD IN DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR. MEANWHILE, RESIDENTS OF THE AFFECTED AREAS TOLD LOCAL RADIO STATIONS THAT THERE WAS HEAVY SHOOTING. THE ARMED ACTIONS ARE TAKING PLACE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF AN OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FMLN IN MID- NOVEMBER. ACCORDING TO ARMY SOURCES, THE OFFENSIVE HAS RESULTED IN 5,000 CASUALTIES, CIVILIAN CASUALTIES NOT INCLUDED.
DEV-MUC3-1018	LIMA, 20 DEC 89 -- IN BARRANCA DISTRICT THIS AFTERNOON, PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA REITERATED HIS REJECTION AND THE PERUVIAN PEOPLE'S CONDEMNATION OF THE INVASION OF PANAMA BY U.S. TROOPS. THE HEAD OF STATE DESCRIBED THIS ACTION AS AN ACT OF ROBBERY AND PIRACY. HE NOTED THAT THIS REPRESENTS AGGRESSION NOT ONLY AGAINST THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE BUT AGAINST THE SOVEREIGNTY OF ALL LATIN AMERICA. GARCIA SAID THAT THIS INSULT AND OUTRAGE AGAINST SOVEREIGN PEOPLES CANNOT OCCUR ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE 21ST CENTURY. A DRAMATIC EVENT IS SHAKING ALL LATIN AMERICA AT THIS MOMENT. BEGINNING EARLY THIS MORNING, THE INVADING FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAVE PENETRATED AND INTERVENED IN LATIN AMERICAN TERRITORY IN PANAMA. THIS IS WHY I AM LATE, BECAUSE SINCE EARLY THIS MORNING WE HAVE BEEN WITNESSING AN ASTONISHING ACT OF IMPERIALIST ROBBERY AND PIRACY TARNISHING THE SACRED SOIL OF PANAMA AND LATIN AMERICA. WE ARE JUST LATIN AMERICANS. IF A LATIN AMERICAN IS OFFENDED AND ATTACKED, THEN WE ARE ALL OFFENDED AND ATTACKED. AND YOU, THE HUANCA PEASANTS, MUST KNOW THAT IN PANAMA IN THE THERE ARE ALSO PEASANTS WHO ARE NOW THE VICTIMS OF THE U.S. INVASION. AND WE MUST STAND UP TO RESCUE . SEVENTY YEARS ELAPSED BEFORE GENERAL OMAR TORRIJOS MANAGED TO SIGN AN AGREEMENT WITH PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER FOR THE PANAMA CANAL TO BE TURNED OVER TO PANAMANIAN SOVEREIGNTY. SINCE THAT 1977 TREATY, HOWEVER, MANY THINGS HAVE HAPPENED AND EFFORTS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN MADE TO PREVENT THE CANAL FROM BEING RETURNED TO LATIN AMERICA. THEY DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE THE CANAL ZONE WHERE THEY HAVE THEIR TROOPS, THEIR AIRPLANES, AND THEIR BOMBS TO THREATEN THE CONTINENT AND TELL ALL OF US THAT IF WE DO NOT BEHAVE WELL THEY CAN INVADE US AT ANY MOMENT. I CANNOT ACCEPT WHAT WAS DONE THIS MORNING WHEN THE NEW PRESIDENT OF PANAMA WAS SWORN IN ON A U.S. BASE IN THE CANAL ZONE. THE AMERICANS DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY WHO IS GOING TO GOVERN IN LATIN AMERICA; ONLY THE LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECIDE THEIR DESTINY. APPLAUSE AND CHEERS IN THE LAST 14 HOURS, 24,000 MEN AND MORE THAN 100 COMBAT VEHICLES HAVE ENTERED PANAMA CITY, AND THE HELICOPTERS HAVE ATTACKED MILITARY INSTALLATIONS ADJACENT TO THE CIVILIAN ZONES. WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT HUNDREDS HAVE BEEN KILLED. AS PRESIDENT OF PERU, AS A CHIEF OF STATE, AND AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE POOR PEASANTS I CANNOT SILENCE OUR PROTEST. I CANNOT SILENCE OUR CONDEMNATION. I CALL ON THE LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLE; I CALL ON THE YOUTH OF LATIN AMERICA IN THE FACE OF THIS IMPERIALISTIC ATTACK. WE CANNOT REMAIN SILENT. WE MAY BE POOR, WE MAY HAVE PROBLEMS, BUT WE ARE DIGNIFIED PEOPLE, WE ARE FREE, WE ARE SOVEREIGN .
DEV-MUC3-1019	PANAMA CITY , 21 DEC 89 -- A PERUVIAN DIPLOMATIC SOURCE HAS CONFIRMED THAT EMILIO TORRES, AIDE TO THE PERUVIAN MILITARY ATTACHE IN PANAMA, WAS WOUNDED TODAY DURING A SHOOTOUT AMONG CIVILIANS NEAR HIS HOME. IN STATEMENTS TO ACAN - EFE, PERUVIAN CHARGE D'AFFAIRES LUIS SANDIGA SAID THAT TORRES, TECHNICIAN FIRST CLASS IN THE PERUVIAN ARMY, WAS SHOT AND THAT THE BULLET FRACTURED SEVERAL RIBS AND PUNCTURED HIS RIGHT LUNG. ACCORDING TO THE DOCTORS ATTENDING TORRES, THE PROGNOSIS IS "GUARDED, BUT HE IS DOING WELL" FOLLOWING SURGERY THAT WAS PERFORMED AT THE SANTO TOMAS HOSPITAL IN PANAMA CITY. SEVERAL ISOLATED ACTS OF VIOLENCE HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN PANAMA CITY SINCE 20 DECEMBER, FOLLOWING THE U.S. MILITARY INTERVENTION. MEANWHILE, SANDIGA SAID THREE ARMED MEN, IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES, ON DECEMBER HELD A GUN ON HIM AND TOOK HIS CAR. THE INCIDENT OCCURRED WHEN SANDIGA WAS ON HIS WAY TO THE EMBASSY. "EVEN THOUGH I IDENTIFIED MYSELF AS A PERUVIAN EMBASSY OFFICIAL AND TOLD THEM THAT THE CAR HAD DIPLOMATIC LICENSE PLATES, THE UNIDENTIFIED ARMED MEN TOOK THE CAR AND HEADED TOWARD AN UNKNOWN LOCATION.
DEV-MUC3-1020	GUATEMALA CITY, 21 DEC 89 -- OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE CONFIRMED THAT JORGE ADOLFO VARGAS, SECOND SECRETARY AT THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN GUATEMALA, WAS SHOT TO DEATH TODAY IN GUATEMALA CITY BY SEVERAL UNIDENTIFIED MEN. A SPOKESMAN FOR THE MUNICIPAL FIRE FIGHTERS TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT THE NICARAGUAN DIPLOMAT WAS WALKING IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA IN SOUTHERN GUATEMALA WHEN UNIDENTIFIED MEN IN A VEHICLE WITH DARKENED WINDOWS FIRED AT HIM WITH 9-MM WEAPONS. THE SOURCE POINTED OUT THAT VARGAS, 38, WAS SHOT SIX TIMES AND DIED ON THE SPOT. THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY ALSO CONFIRMED THE REPORT FOR ACAN-EFE BUT OFFERED NO DETAILS. SO FAR THE AUTHORITIES ARE UNAWARE OF THE MURDERERS' IDENTITIES OR THE MOTIVE FOR VARGAS GONZALEZ'S MURDER.
DEV-MUC3-1021	SANTIAGO, 21 DEC 89 -- THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT , THE LARGEST CLANDESTINE LEFTIST GUERRILLA GROUP IN CHILE, ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT IT WILL ATTACK "ANY U.S. OBJECTIVE IN CHILE" IN VIEW OF THE U.S. INVASION OF PANAMA. THROUGH A TELEPHONE CALL TO THE MEDIA, FPMR SPOKESPERSON MARIELA VARGAS -- A MEMBER OF THE FPMR'S "AUTONOMOUS" SECTOR -- REPORTED THAT THE FPMR WILL ATTACK ANY U.S. OBJECTIVE IN CHILE." VARGAS STATED THAT "WE CATEGORICALLY REJECT AND CONDEMN THE U.S.' TERRORIST INVASION OF THE PANAMANIAN NATION." THE FPMR PROMOTES "ALL FORMS OF STRUGGLE" AGAINST THE MILITARY GOVERNMENT. SHE SAID THAT ACCORDING TO REPORTS SUPPLIED BY THE "DIGNITY" BATTALIONS , U.S. HELICOPTERS CONTINUOUSLY BOMBED THE SAN MIGUELITO SECTOR IN PANAMA CITY THIS MORNING. MARIELA VARGAS ADDED THAT "WE BELIEVE THAT ALL NATIONS AND DEMOCRATIC FORCES HAVE THE MORAL DUTY TO DENOUNCE THIS ACTION AND TO UNDERTAKE SPECIFIC MEASURES AGAINST SUCH AN UNJUSTIFIABLE CRIMINAL ACTION." MARIELA VARGAS ALSO URGED THE CHILEAN PEOPLE "TO ACTIVELY DEMAND THE IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL OF THE INVADER."
DEV-MUC3-1022	SAN SALVADOR, 20 DEC 89 -- COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHIEF OF THE SALVADORAN JOINT STAFF, HAS STATED THAT THE FMLN DOES NOT HAVE THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE TO LAUNCH A NEW OFFENSIVE BECAUSE THE RANK-AND-FILE OF THIS ORGANIZATION ARE TOTALLY DEMORALIZED DUE TO THE HEAVY CASUALTIES THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN. HE ADDED THAT THESE CASUALTIES INCLUDE NINE "COMMANDERS." COL PONCE ADDED: "THE ARMED FORCES HAVE DEFEATED THE FMLN IN THE NORTHERN ZONE AND IN SOYAPANGO, SAN SALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL AND MORAZAN, CAUSING IN THE PROCESS OVER 2,000 CASUALTIES INCLUDING SEVERAL COMMANDERS AND MERCENARIES." THE FMLN HAS PUBLICLY ADMITTED THAT "COMMANDERS" HERNAN SOLORZANO , JORGE ORLANDO SANDOVAL , GEOMAR ARI , OVIDIO LOPEZ , AND "POLITICAL OFFICERS" JOSE SANTOS LLANES AND MILAGROS ALVARADO , HAVE BEEN KILLED. TERRORIST LEADERS MISAEL GALLARDO, NICOLAS ALBERTO SARAVIA, AND RICARDO MIRANDA HAVE ALSO BEEN KILLED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE FAILED FMLN OFFENSIVE ON 11 NOVEMBER. COL PONCE REPORTED THAT MANY MERCENARIES, INCLUDING SOME WHO LOOKED EUROPEAN, DIED DURING THE CLASH WITH THE ARMY IN COLONIA ESCALON. PONCE ADDED THAT THE FAMILIES OF THESE MERCENARIES ARE NOW INQUIRING ABOUT THEM IN NICARAGUA. COL PONCE BELIEVES THAT THE SABOTAGE WHICH THE FMLN IS CARRYING OUT BY BURNING BUSSES, DESTROYING POWER PYLONS, AND STAGING SMALL- SCALE ATTACKS, ARE MERELY THE "LAST KICKS" OF A DROWNING PERSON. ASSISTED BY THE AIR FORCE, THE SALVADORAN ARMY CONTINUES TO STRIKE AT THE FEW TERRORISTS STRONGHOLDS IN THE NORTH, PARTS OF THE CAPITAL, AND OTHER AREAS IN THE INTERIOR. PONCE INDICATED THAT THE FMLN IS SPREADING LIES IN AN ATTEMPT TO MAINTAIN ITS CREDIBILITY AND TO COVER UP THE HEAVY CASUALTIES IT HAS TAKEN. THE CASUALTIES REALLY NUMBER OVER 2,000 ALTHOUGH THE FMLN CLAIMS ONLY TO HAVE LOST 400 PEOPLE. THE OFFICIAL ARMED FORCES REPORT ISSUED ON 30 NOVEMBER STATES THAT THE FMLN SUSTAINED 2,132 KILLED IN ACTION DURING THE OFFENSIVE WHILE THE GOVERNMENT LOST 476 TROOPS. COL PONCE ADDED THAT THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES INTO THE DEATH OF FOUR PEOPLE WHO DIED IN THE CRASH OF A PLANE THAT WAS BRINGING ARMS FOR THE FMLN FROM NICARAGUA. THE CRASH OCCURED IN AN ISOLATED AREA OF USULUTAN DEPARTMENT. UNTIL YESTERDAY THE FMLN HAD NOT ADMITTED THAT THE CREW OF THE PLANE CARRYING ARMS THAT CRASHED ON 25 SEPTEMBER BELONGED TO TERRORIST GROUPS. ACCORDING TO THE FMLN THE CREW MEMBERS WERE SALVADORANS. THE TERRORISTS REPORTED THAT THE DEAD CREWMEN WERE PILOT OSVALDO ALFARO AGUINADA, ALSO KNOWN AS "LUIS" AND "ANTIAIRCRAFT GUNNERS" ROMEL HERNANDEZ ARGUETA , ISIDRO PARADA MARTINEZ , AND SANTIAGO RAUDA POSADA . COL PONCE STATED THAT THIS "RUMOR IS A COMMUNIST MANEUVER TO MAKE SURE THAT DANIEL ORTEGA DOES NOT GET BLAMED IN THE LIGHT OF THE INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE AGAINST HIM BECAUSE OF HIS SUBVERSIVE CAMPAIGN IN AREA COUNTRIES." PONCE ADDED THAT THE CURRENT STRATEGY OF THE DEFEATED FMLN IS LIMITED TO TALKING ABOUT FALSE VICTORIES TO NEWS MEDIA THAT THEY CONTROL, SO AS NOT TO DEMORALIZE THEIR RANK-AND-FILE; TO REFUTING ARMY REPORTS; AND TO DISSEMINATING FALSE FIGURES ON CASUALTIES ALLEGEDLY INFLICTED TO THE ARMY.
DEV-MUC3-1023	GUATEMALA CITY, 22 DEC 89 -- THREE MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE BRIGADES ASSIGNED TO GUATEMALA WERE ATTACKED YESTERDAY BY ALLEGED CRIMINALS WHO STABBED THEM NEAR THE THEIR BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS ON MARISCAL STREET IN THIS CAPITAL. ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES FROM THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE BRIGADES, THE VICTIMS WERE TWO CANADIAN WOMEN AND AN AMERICAN MALE CITIZEN. THE REPORT STATES THAT THE THREE MEMBERS WERE RETURNING TO THEIR HEADQUARTERS WHEN THEY WERE INTERCEPTED AND ATTACKED BY TWO YOUNG MEN WHO STABBED THEM. THE AGGRESSORS FIRST STABBED THE TWO WOMEN IN THE CHEST, CAUSING DEEP WOUNDS. THE AMERICAN MAN TRIED TO DEFEND THE TWO WOMEN BUT HE SUFFERED CUTS ON HIS HANDS AND WRISTS, AND AROUND HIS WAIST. THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE BRIGADES IN GUATEMALA REPORT STATES: WE CONSIDER THAT THE ATTACK ON THEIR MEMBERS REPRESENTS AN ACTION OF INTIMIDATION AGAINST THIS ORGANIZATION AND THE HUMANITARIAN TASK IT CARRIES OUT IN GUATEMALA. THE AGGRESSORS DID NOT ASK FOR MONEY OR TRY TO STEAL ANYTHING FROM THE THREE VICTIMS. DURING THE ATTACK THE WOMEN DROPPED THEIR PURSES AND THE ATTACKERS DID NOT TRY TO STEAL THEM. WE CONSIDER THAT THIS IS ANOTHER ATTACK IN THE ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE TO INTIMIDATE THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE BRIGADES, WHOSE PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN RECEIVING DEATH THREATS SINCE MAY. TWO GRENADES WERE HURLED AT THE ORGANIZATION'S HEADQUARTERS IN AUGUST. THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE BRIGADES ARE AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROMOTES THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF NON-VIOLENCE, SEEKING PEACE THROUGH NON-VIOLENT MEANS. THIS PEACE INVOLVES NEGOTIATION, DIALOGUE, AND OTHER NON-VIOLENT METHODS. THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE BRIGADES DO NOT INTERFERE IN GUATEMALAN DOMESTIC AFFAIRS OR IN THE ACTIVITIES OF ANY GUATEMALAN ORGANIZATION. THEY ONLY GIVE HUMANITARIAN HELP AND MAINTAIN AN INDEPENDENT ATTITUDE.
DEV-MUC3-1024	LIMA, 23 DEC 89 -- PERUVIAN AMBASSADOR IN PANAMA MARIO CASTRO ARENAS TODAY ASKED THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT TO SEND MILITARY PLANES TO PANAMA TO EVACUATE PERUVIAN CITIZENS WHO ARE IN DANGER. THE AMBASSADOR TOLD A LOCAL RADIO STATION THAT HE HAD URGED PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA TO SEND PLANES THAT COULD ALSO BRING FOOD AND MEDICINE TO THE PANAMANIANS. CASTRO ARENAS, WHO HAS BEEN IN LIMA SINCE AUGUST THIS YEAR, RECALLED BY HIS GOVERNMENT, SAID THAT EARLY THIS MORNING HE RECEIVED A DESPERATE CALL FROM A GROUP OF PERUVIAN CITIZENS WHO WERE AFRAID THAT THEY WERE ABOUT TO BE ATTACKED BY A MOB OF PANAMANIANS. THE AMBASSADOR EXPLAINED THAT THERE IS "WIDESPREAD LOOTING" IN PANAMA BECAUSE THE POOREST PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY, AND HE ADDED THAT THE SITUATION IS ONE OF "CHAOS AND ANARCHY AND NOT OF TRANQUILLITY AS THE PEOPLE IN LIMA BELIEVE." CASTRO ARENAS EXPLAINED THAT THE ATTACKS ON BUILDINGS FROM WHICH U.S. SOLDIERS ARE BEING RESISTED IS CONSTANTLY THREATENING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.

ACCORDING TO THE AMBASSADOR, THE PERUVIAN DIPLOMATS ARE ALL BLOCKED AT THEIR HOMES; THEIR CARS HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY, AND ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN WOUNDED BY A GUNSHOT. CASTRO ARENAS SAID THAT HE IS CONSTANTLY RECEIVING CALLS THAT KEEP HIM INFORMED OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN PANAMA. HE SAID THAT THE NATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWING SO MUCH CONCERN OVER WHAT IS HAPPENING IN PANAMA SHOULD START URGENTLY SENDING FOOD AND MEDICINE AND "NOT STOP AT MERE DECLARATIONS."
DEV-MUC3-1025	SAN SALVADOR, 21 DEC 89 -- THE REVOLUTIONARY NATIONAL MOVEMENT PARTY HAS CONDEMNED THE U.S. MILITARY INTERVENTION IN PANAMA AND SAID THAT THE NORTHERN POWER DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO VIOLATE THE PRINCIPLE OF SELF-DETERMINATION. AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY DEMANDS THE SUSPENSION OF THAT MILITARY INTERVENTION AND RESPECT FOR PANAMANIAN SOVEREIGNTY AND FOR THE PRINCIPLES OF NONINTERVENTION AND SELF-DETERMINATION, WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. "THE U.S. GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HAVE ANY LEGAL RIGHT TO DEPLOY ITS MILITARY TROOPS AND MURDER CIVILIANS AND SOLDIERS WHO ARE DEFENDING THEIR FATHERLAND," THE COMMUNIQUE STATES. "NO MATTER WHO GENERAL NORIEGA IS, PANAMA IS NOT UNDER U.S. POLITICAL JURISDICTION, AND, IN ACCORDANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW, WE CANNOT ACCEPT SUCH ACTS OF AGGRESSION AND FORCE," THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS.
DEV-MUC3-1026	BEIJING , 15 DEC 89 -- FROM 10 TO 12 DECEMBER, PRESIDENTS OF FIVE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES HELD A SPECIAL MEETING TO MEDIATE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND GUERRILLAS. BUT SO FAR NO AGREEMENT HAS BEEN REACHED BY BOTH SIDES ON BRINGING ABOUT A CEASE-FIRE DURING CHRISTMAS. THEIR 1-MONTH-LONG FIERCE BATTLE HAS LEFT 3,000 PEOPLE DEAD AND ALSO CAST A SHADOW OVER THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PROCESS. THE CURRENT CIVIL WAR IN EL SALVADOR WAS TRIGGERED OFF BY THE DESTRUCTION OF THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE LABOR FEDERATION, THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST TRADE UNION ORGANIZATION. ON 31 OCTOBER, AN ULTRARIGHTIST "DARE-TO-DIE SQUAD" SUPPORTED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE MILITARY USED A HEAVY BOMB TO BOMBARD THE HEADQUARTERS BUILDING OF THE LABOR FEDERATION, KILLING AND WOUNDING OVER 40 PEOPLE INCLUDING PRINCIPAL LEADERS OF THE FEDERATION. ON 2 NOVEMBER, THE GUERRILLAS ISSUED A STATEMENT STRONGLY CONDEMNING THE TERRORIST ACTIVITY OF THE SQUAD AND DECLARING THE CANCELLATION OF THE THIRD ROUND OF TALKS WITH THE GOVERNMENT SCHEDULED IN VENEZUELA. ON THE SAME NIGHT THE GUERRILLAS LAUNCHED A LARGE-SCALE OFFENSIVE "TO ELIMINATE FASCISM." ABOUT 8,000 GUERRILLAS SWIFTLY CAPTURED MANY TOWNS AND STRATEGIC POSITIONS NORTHWEST OF THE CAPITAL AND CUT KEY COMMUNICATIONS LINES BETWEEN THE CAPITAL AND THE HINTERLAND. IN THE MEANTIME, THEY ALSO ATTACKED SOME 50 GOVERNMENT ARMY BASES AND POLICE STATIONS IN THE HINTERLAND, THUS CONTROLLING 30 PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY'S TERRITORY. THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED "LOCAL PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENTS" IN 8 OF THE 14 PROVINCES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE GOVERNMENT DISPATCHED ARMORED CARS AND AIR FORCE UNITS TO CARRY OUT COUNTERATTACKS. THEY WANTONLY BOMBARDED THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS NEAR THE CAPITAL CITY OCCUPIED BY THE GUERRILLAS. AFTER 8 DAYS OF FIERCE BATTLE, THE GUERRILLAS SHOT DOWN 12 GOVERNMENT FIGHTER PLANES AND HELICOPTERS; DESTROYED 34 TANKS, ARMORED CARS, AND PATROL CARS; AND CAPTURED A LARGE AMOUNT OF ARMS AND AMMUNITION. SUBSEQUENTLY BATTLES CONTINUED IN REGIONS OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL CITY. SINCE EARLY DECEMBER BOTH SIDES HAVE ENGAGED IN FIERCE BATTLES IN THE CAPITAL CITY AND THE HINTERLAND. THE GUERRILLAS USED MORTARS TO ATTACK THE BUILDING OF THE GOVERNMENT ARMY GENERAL STAFF HEADQUARTERS, THE U.S. EMBASSY, AND THE PRESIDENTIAL RESTAURANT, WHEREAS THE GOVERNMENT ARMY DISPATCHED PLANES TO BOMBARD THE GUERRILLA POSITIONS. FIERCE BATTLES HAVE ALSO BROKEN OUT IN CHALATENANGO, SAN MIGUEL, AND OTHER TOWNS, THEREBY CAUSING HEAVY CASUALTIES AND PROPERTY LOSSES. THIS WAR HAS DEEP-ROOTED CAUSES. EL SALVADOR IS A SMALL COUNTRY WITH AN AREA OF 21,000 SQUARE KM AND A POPULATION OF 5 MILLION. DURING THIS 10-YEAR-LONG WAR, 70,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND THE NATIONAL ECONOMY HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY DESTROYED. THE ULTRARIGHTIST NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE WON THE GENERAL ELECTION EARLY THIS YEAR, THUS AGGRAVATING THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND THE GOVERNMENT. PRIOR TO THE ELECTION, THE GUERRILLAS PUT FORWARD A PEACE PROPOSAL DEMANDING SIX MONTHS' POSPONEMENT OF THE ELECTION SO AS TO MAKE THEIR PARTICIPATION POSSIBLE. BUT THIS PROPOSAL WAS REJECTED BY THE GOVERNMENT. BECAUSE ALMOST HALF OF THE VOTERS DID NOT VOTE, THE GUERRILLAS DECLARED IT DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT. PRESSED BY DOMESTIC PUBLIC OPINION AND URGED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE AGREEMENT, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS HELD TWO ROUNDS OF TALKS IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER. DURING THEIR TALKS THE GUERRILLAS DEMANDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT STOP ITS SUPPRESSION, INTRODUCE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND JUDICIAL REFORMS, REORGANIZE THE ARMED FORCES, AND PUNISH THE "DARE-TO-DIE SQUAD." THE GOVERNMENT INSISTED THAT THE GUERRILLAS SHOULD LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS BEFORE REFORMS WERE CARRIED OUT. THE HARD-LINE POSITION OF THE GOVERNMENT REFLECTED THE ESTABLISHED POLICY OF THE RULING PARTY, WHICH HAS ALL ALONG STOOD FOR RULING THE COUNTRY BY MILITARY MEANS, ADVOCATED THE SUPPRESSION OF DEMOCRATIC FORCES, AND SUPPORTED THE "DARE-TO-DIE SQUAD" IN CARRYING OUT ASSASSINATION. A UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT IN CENTRAL AMERICA WAS ASSASSINATED BY THE SQUAD FOR CRITICIZING THE ULTRARIGHTIST POLICY OF THE RULING PARTY. RECENTLY THE RULING PARTY SUPPORTED THE "DARE-TO-DIE SQUAD" IN ATTACKING THE LABOR FEDERATION'S BUILDING. THIS IGNITED THE CURRENT CIVIL WAR AND UNDERMINED THE PEACE PROCESS IN THE COUNTRY. THE GUERRILLAS ISSUED A STATEMENT ON 12 DECEMBER CONDEMNING THE MEETING OF THE FIVE HEADS OF STATE FOR BEING PARTIAL TO THE ULTRARIGHTIST SALVADORIAN GOVERNMENT. THEY MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY WOULD NOT ACCEPT ANY EFFORT TO DISSOLVE THE GUERRILLA FORCES AND WOULD CARRY ON THEIR STRUGGLE.
DEV-MUC3-1027	GUATEMALA CITY, 24 DEC 89 -- GUATEMALAN CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO TODAY CALLED THE GUATEMALAN PEOPLE TO "THINK" DURING CHRISTMAS ABOUT THE PANAMANIAN, SALVADORAN, AND ROMANIAN PEOPLE, WHO ARE EXPERIENCING A "DIFFICULT" SITUATION. DURING A MESSAGE DELIVERED THROUGH A NATIONAL NETWORK, CEREZO SAID THAT "CHRISTMAS IS A SPECIAL TIME TO SIT AROUND WITH THE FAMILY AND REFLECT UPON THE FUTURE AND THE GOALS ONE WISHES TO ATTAIN." PRESIDENT CEREZO SAID: "I WOULD LIKE TO REFLECT WITH YOU, BECAUSE WHEN ONE TAKES A LOOK AROUND THE WORLD, ONE SEES THE GREAT DIFFICULTIES THAT MANY COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING TO ACHIEVE AND BUILD DEMOCRACY." CEREZO MENTIONED THE CASE OF ROMANIA, WHERE WORKERS WHO WERE DEMONSTRATING TO DEMAND WAGE INCREASES AND A DEMOCRATIZING PROCESS WERE SHOT BY THE SECURITY FORCES RESULTING IN THOUSANDS OF DEAD AND WOUNDED. CEREZO ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE CRISIS PANAMA IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING AND SAID THAT NOW THE "PANAMANIAN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE A VERY SAD CHRISTMAS AND WILL FACE MANY DIFFICULTIES TO GET FOOD." PRESIDENT CEREZO STRESSED THAT "PROBLEMS SHOULD BE SOLVED THROUGH DIALOGUE, THAT WAR SHOULD BE AVOIDED AND THAT GUATEMALA MUST PREVENT DISASTER FROM REACHING THE COUNTRY, AS HAS HAPPENED IN OTHER NATIONS." CEREZO ADMITTED THAT GUATEMALA IS PAYING A HIGH PRICE TO SOLVE ITS ECONOMIC SITUATION, BUT HE STRESSED THAT ALL THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD HAD TO PAY HIGH PRICES TO BE ABLE TO MAKE PROGRESS. CEREZO STRESSED THAT "JAPAN, WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, EXPERIENCED A WORLD WAR. GERMANY ALSO EXPERIENCED DIFFICULT TIMES AND LEARNED THE LESSON THAT THE WAR DID NOT BRING ANY BENEFITS TO THEM." CEREZO SAID THAT THE 4 YEARS OF HIS GOVERNMENT, WHICH WAS INAUGURATED IN JANUARY 1986, "HAVE BEEN TRULY INTERESTING." HE SAID THAT HE HAS FACED PROBLEMS AND THAT HE HAS BEEN CRITICIZED, BUT HE ADDED THAT THE CRISIS, HOWEVER, IS BEING SOLVED THROUGH DIALOGUE. PRESIDENT CEREZO ADDED THAT THE ECONOMIC MEASURES ADOPTED BY HIS GOVERNMENT HAVE INCREASED THE COST OF LIVING. CEREZO SAID THAT GUATEMALA IS ONE OF THE THREE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE REGISTERED ECONOMIC GROWTH, BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE BUSINESSES, STORES, AND EMPLOYMENT HERE.
DEV-MUC3-1028	PANAMA CITY , 25 DEC 89 -- ECUADORAN EMBASSY SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT 55 ECUADOREANS, INCLUDING ECUADORAN AGRICULTURE MINISTER MARIO JALIL, WERE EVACUATED LAST NIGHT FROM PANAMA IN AN AIRPLANE FROM THEIR COUNTRY. THE AIRPLANE, WHICH IS THE FIRST TO LAND IN PANAMA AFTER THE U.S. MILITARY INTERVENTION, LANDED A CARGO OF MEDICINE AT OMAR TORRIJOS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, AFTER FIRST HAVING LANDED AT THE U.S. HOWARD AIR BASE. AN ECUADORAN DIPLOMAT SAID THAT "THE AIRPORT SMELLED OF DEAD BODIES." THE NEARBY TOCUMEN AIR BASE WAS THE BATTLEGROUND FOR HARSH CLASHES BETWEEN U.S. AND PANAMANIAN TROOPS, AND IT WAS BOMBED BY THE UNITED STATES. AN AIRPLANE FROM MEXICO ALSO ARRIVED IN PANAMA LAST NIGHT BRINGING FOOD AND MEDICINE, BUT WITH THE PURPOSE OF EVACUATING MEXICAN CITIZENS BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY. OTHER AIRPLANES FROM SPAIN, COLOMBIA, GERMANY, AND SEVERAL OTHER EUROPEAN AND LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES ARE WAITING FOR U.S. SOUTHERN COMMAND AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER PANAMANIAN AIR SPACE AND LAND IN PANAMA.
DEV-MUC3-1029	SANTIAGO, 26 DEC 89 -- FOREIGN MINISTER HERNAN FELIPE ERRAZURIZ HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE CHILEAN COMMUNITY AND DIPLOMATIC PERSONNEL IN ROMANIA ARE SAFE AND SOUND. THE FOREIGN MINISTER ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT OF FIDEL CASTRO IS THE ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD, ALONG WITH ALBANIA, THAT HAS NOT UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE ARE NEW WINDS OF LIBERTY AND PROGRESS BLOWING. THE FOREIGN MINISTER POINTED OUT THAT IT IS QUITE NORMAL FOR FIDEL CASTRO TO IGNORE THIS FACT BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN IN POWER FOR THE PAST 30 YEARS. REGARDING CHILE'S RELATIONS WITH PANAMA, THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT HE IS VERY SATISFIED THAT THE SITUATION IS RETURNING TO NORMAL IN THAT COUNTRY. HE ALSO SAID THAT IT IS A VERY POSITIVE SIGN THAT SHIPS WITH CHILEAN EXPORTS WILL BE ABLE TO RESUME NORMAL USE OF THE PANAMA CANAL BEGINNING ON 27 DECEMBER, AS THESE SHIPS HAD BEEN HELD BACK.
DEV-MUC3-1030	LIMA, 25 DEC 89 -- WHEN I APPLY ALL MY ARGUMENTATIVE AND RETHORICAL ENERGY TO THE SUBJECT OF PANAMA, AND I DO SO WITH ABSOLUTE SINCERITY, NOT SIMPLY TO TAKE A STANCE, BUT BECAUSE AS A LATIN AMERICAN I FEEL GREATLY OFFENDED IN A WAY THAT YOU COULD NOT UNDERSTAND. I FEEL TERRIBLY OFFENDED. IF I MAKE DEMANDS AND IF I CONDEMN, I KNOW THAT NOBODY WILL QUICKLY FOLLOW ME DOWN THIS ROAD OF FIRMNESS AND CONDEMNATION. BUT THIS IS A SECONDARY ASPECT. I WISH I WERE FOLLOWED, BUT IF AM NOT, THIS DOES NOT DETRACT FROM THE JUSTICE OF WHAT I AM DOING. ONE TRIES TO DO WHAT IS INTRINSICALLY GOOD, NOT SIMPLY WHAT ONE CAN NECESSARILY WIN. PARDON ME. IT WOULD BE WORSE IF YOU DIDN'T DO IT. IT WOULD BE LESS EFFECTIVE, THOUGH IT WOULD BE SOMEWHAT EFFECTIVE. DON'T BE UNJUST. IT WOULD BE EVEN LESS EFFECTIVE IF WE ALL REMAINED SILENT AND SAID: YES, UNCLE SAM, YOU ARE THE MASTER AND WE MUST OBEY. WE ARE THE UNCLE TOM IN LATIN AMERICA. LOOK, I DON'T EXPECT.... WE DON'T HAVE TO MIX THEM . WE CONTINUE OUR NEGOTIATION WITH THE IMF, AND THAT TO ME STILL SEEMS VERY POSITIVE. MAY IT NOT TURN OUT AS THE ILLUSION I HAD THAT RELATIONS WERE CHANGING AT THE POLTICAL LEVEL. FIRST, I WOULD NOT ALLOW A HARDENING OF PERU ATTITUDE TOWARD THE UNITED STATES. THERE IS A HARDENING WHEN ONE SLAPS SOMEONE ELSE IN THE FACE. IN THIS CASE WE HAVE A CONCRETE SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION. THERE IS A GREAT ISSUE TO DISCUSS BETWEEN LATIN AMERICA AND THE UNITED STATES. YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO INVADE. WHO CALLED YOU? ENDARA HIMSELF HAD TO SAY -- BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHAT THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE THINKING, THOUGH A PERCENTAGE OF THEM ARE INDIFFERENT -- THAT HE DID NOT CALL THEM. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? PRESIDENT ENDARA SAYS THAT HE DIDN'T CALL FOR THE INVASION. THIS SHOULD BE AUTOMATICALLY UNDERSTOOD. FOR SOME REASON HE SAID IT. SO I WOULD NOT CALL IT A HARDENING. I BEG YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE EXACT SHADE OF THE TERM. WE ARE ENERGIC IN OPPOSING A CONCRETE FACT, BUT WHAT DO THE PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA, THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA, THE PEOPLE OF JEFFERSON, OF WHITMAN, OF LINCLON -- THAT GREAT DEFENDER OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND RACIAL EQUALITY -- WHAT HAVE THEY HAVE TO DO WITH THAT ACT? WE HAVE TO RESPECT THE GREATNESS OF THE UNITED STATES. FROM LATIN AMERICA, THE UNITED STATES IS SEEN IN VARIOUS WAYS. FOR THE TIME BEING, I SEE IT AS THE ROME OF THE MODERN WORLD. I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THE LATIN AMERICANS MUST BE UNDERSTOOD INSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE LATIN AMERICAN EXPERIENCE HAS TO SEEN INSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THEN A SOUND RELATIONSHINP WILL EMERGE BETWEEN THE TWO CONTINENTS. BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES IS THE ROME OF THE MODERN WORLD -- FOR THE CAPACITY OF ITS ATOMIC LEGIONS; FOR THEIR HAVING CONCENTRATED SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY, ALTHOUGH BOTH WERE BROUGHT OVER FROM EUROPE AS THE ROMANS BROUGHT THEM FROM GREECE; FOR THEIR HAVING GENERATED AN EXTRAORDINARY TECHNOLOGY, AND FOR THEIR BEING A DEMOCRACY -- THE UNITED STATES MUST BE RESPECTED. WE WILL HAVE TO DISTINGUISH ALL THAT FROM A PARTICULAR ACT BY THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION. THIS IS WHY WE SAY AMERICANS REFERRING TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND SAY YANKEE TO DEFINE SOME ACTS BY THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION. SO I DON'T BELIEVE, SIR, THAT THERE IS A HARDENING, AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND IT VERY WELL. I BELIEVE THEY UNDERSTAND ME WHEN I TELL THEM THAT I CANNOT SIT AT THE TABLE WITH THEM WHEN THEY ARE KILLING PANAMANIAN PEOPLE. LET THE MINISTERS, THE POLICE CHIEFS, THE PROSECUTORS, THE ATTORNEY GENERALS SIT AT A TABLE. THAT IS GOOD. BUT THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NATION? DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN? I THINK THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN IT. I DO NOT BELIEVE IT WOULD BE A BAD THING FOR MR MANTILLA TO SIT WITH MR BENNETT OR WITH THE JUSTICE MINISTER OF COLOMBIA. I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS WOULD BE BAD. THIS IS THE PROOF THAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE THE ANTIDRUG PLAN. BUT THOSE WHO PERSONIFY THE NATION CANNOT MEET. WE CANNOT DO SO UNDER THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES. SO THIS IS NOT HARDENING. AS FOR THE IMF, I BELIEVE THAT IT IS AN ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT MATTER. THESE MATTERS ARE WELL DIFFERENTIATED. I AM NOT HERE AS A DEMAGOGUE, AS SOME RIGHT WING MEDIA ASSERT. THOSE PEOPLE ARE FIGHTENED WHEN I DRAW A LOT OF PEOPLE DESPITE MY POLTICAL DECLINE. I AM NOT BEING A DEMAGOGUE, AND I AM NOT HERE BECAUSE THE BEST WAY TO WIN VOTES IS TO INDULGE IN ANTI-AMERICAN POLITICS FROM HERE UNTIL 28 JULY 1990. I WILL NOT LAPSE INTO THAT IRRESPONSIBILITY. HERE WE HAVE A CONCRETE FACT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH OUR CULTURAL, COMMERCIAL, POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH ORGANIZATIONS WHERE THE UNITED STATES MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE INFLUENCE. I SEPARATE THINGS VERY WELL.
DEV-MUC3-1031	BUENOS AIRES, 28 DEC 89 -- THE ARGENTINE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES TODAY "STRONGLY REPUDIATED" THE U.S. MILITARY INTERVENTION IN PANAMA BY APPROVING A DECLARATION SPONSORED BY THE JUSTICIALIST PARTY AND THE RADICAL CIVIC UNION BLOCS. THE PROPOSAL MET WITH STRONG OPPOSITION FROM THE DEMOCRATIC CENTRIST UNION DEPUTIES. THE DECLARATION PROPOSED BY PJ DEPUTY JUAN PABLO CAFIERO CALLS FOR THE IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL OF THE U.S. TROOPS THAT INVADED PANAMA TO OUST GENERAL MANUEL NORIEGA'S GOVERNMENT. IT ALSO URGES THE UNITED STATES TO "STRICTLY COMPLY WITH THE TORRIJOS-CARTER TREATIES" ON THE FUTURE OF THE PANAMA CANAL. THE DECLARATION REJECTS ALL TYPES OF DICTATORIAL REGIMES, IMPLICITLY REFERRING TO NORIEGA. THIS STATEMENT WAS INCLUDED IN THE DECLARATION AT THE SUGGESTION OF FEDERAL PARTY DEPUTY RUTH MONJARDIN AFTER OBTAINING THE SUPPORT OF JOSE MANZANO, THE SPEAKER FOR THE PJ BLOC; SATURNINO ARANA , CHAIRMAN OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE; AND UCR DEPUTY DANTE CAPUTO. THE DECLARATION ALSO RECEIVED THE SUPPORT OF INTRANSIGENT PARTY DEPUTY OSCAR ALENDE, CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY DEPUTY HECTOR GATTI, AND POPULAR DEMOCRATIC PARTY DEPUTY ALBERTO ARAMOUNI. DEPUTY LUIS ZAMORA OF THE MOVEMENT TOWARD SOCIALISM REJECTED THE DECLARATION ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT WAS MEANINGLESS "TO ASK ANYTHING OF A COUNTRY THAT IS KILLING PANAMANIANS." THE UCEDE OPPOSED THE DECLARATION, AND BLOC SPEAKER FEDERICO CLERICI WAS MOCKED BY PJ AND UCR DEPUTIES WHEN HE READ AN ALTERNATE DECLARATION PREPARED BY UCEDE DEPUTY ADELINA DALESSIO DE VIOLA, WHICH URGED THE GOVERNMENTS OF BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND PANAMA TO "STOP USING VIOLENCE." UCEDE DEPUTY FRANCISCO DURANONA Y VEDIA CRITICIZED THE DECLARATION BY STATING THAT IT IMPLIED SUPPORT FOR GENERAL NORIEGA'S REGIME. DEPUTY FEDERICO ZAMORA, ALSO FROM THE UCEDE, LAMENTED THAT "THERE ARE SO MANY FORGETFUL PEOPLE HERE. A LOT IS BEING SAID ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN PANAMA, BUT NOTHING IS BEING SAID ABOUT ROMANIA." FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER AND UCR DEPUTY DANTE CAPUTO SUPPORTED THE DECLARATION AND SAID THAT "TO ACCEPT THE U.S. INVASION WOULD BE TANTAMOUNT TO ADMITTING THAT THE END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS," ADDING THAT SUCH IDEAS MUST BE REJECTED, EVEN THOUGH PANAMA MAY HAVE HAD AN "ILLEGAL, DICTATORIAL AND CORRUPT" GOVERNMENT. TOWARD THE END OF THE DEBATE, PJ BLOC SPEAKER JOSE MANZANO SAID THAT "BY CRITICIZING THIS SAVAGERY WE SEEK TO HELP RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND LATIN AMERICA . HE ADDED THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR THE DESIRE FOR FREEDOM OF TALL BLOND EAST GERMANS AND OF SHORT DARK PANAMANIANS."
DEV-MUC3-1032	SANTIAGO, 28 DEC 89 -- A BOMB EXPLODED IN THE BATHROOM OF THE CHILEAN-U.S. CULTURAL INSTITUTE AT 1467 MONEDA STREET WHILE 360 STUDENTS WERE IN THE BUILDING. THE POLICE HAVE SAID THAT THE BOMB CONTAINED 1 KG OF EXPLOSIVES MADE UP OF AMMONIUM GELIGNITE AND ANFO . THE BOMB WAS SET OFF BY A FUSE SYSTEM. THE BOMB CAUSED SERIOUS DAMAGE TO THE 5TH-FLOOR MENS ROOM. THE POLICE REPORTED THAT THE EXPLOSION CAUSED A PANIC BUT NO CASUALTIES.
DEV-MUC3-1033	SAN SALVADOR, 28 DEC 89 -- FATHER JOSE MARIA TOJEIRA S.J. , THE JESUIT PROVINCIAL SPOKESMAN FOR CENTRAL AMERICA, HAS RELEASED A NOTE DENYING INEXACT REPORTS ON THE CASE OF THE MURDERED JESUIT PRIESTS. HE SAID THAT THEY NOT WERE MARXIST GUERRILLA SYMPATHIZERS. THE NOTE READS AS FOLLOWS: 23 DECEMBER 1989 PROV. 264/89 DIRECTOR DUTRIZ DIRECTOR OF LA PRENSA GRAFICA SAN SALVADOR DEAR MR.DIRECTOR: THE NEWSPAPER WHICH YOU DIRECT, ON 21 DECEMBER 1989, PUBLISHED ON PAGES 6 AND 7 TWO ARTICLES ON THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS THAT WERE MURDERED ON 16 NOVEMBER. THESE ARTICLES ARE WRITTEN IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY DISTORT THE REALITY OF THE CASE OR THEY INCORRECTLY DESCRIBE THE ACTIVITY OF THE SOCIETY OF JESUS. ON PAGE 6 AN ARTICLE ENTITLED "FRATRICIDAL STRUGGLE," WHICH IS SIGNED BY MR. LUIS PAZOS, SAYS THAT "THE PRIESTS WERE MARXIST GUERRILLA SYMPATHIZERS" AND THAT THE UNIVERSITY IN WHICH THEY WORK "IS KNOWN IN EL SALVADOR AS AN INTELLECTUAL CENTER FOR GUERRILLAS." THE ARTICLE SPEAKS OF "THESE PRIESTS' NEOMARXIST-PHILOSOPHICAL POSITION WHICH IS CONTRARY TO CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE." I WISH TO STATE THAT: 1. THE MURDERED PRIESTS WERE NOT SYMPATHIZERS OF THE MARXIST GUERRILLAS. THEY ONLY TRIED TO TALK WITH THE DIFFERENT SECTORS IN CONFLICT IN EL SALVADOR, SEEKING TO MEDIATE IN AN EFFORT TO FIND PEACE WITH JUSTICE. 2. PERHAPS SOME PEOPLE IN EL SALVADOR CONSIDER THE UCA AS AN INTELLECTUAL CENTER FOR GUERRILLAS, BUT THERE ARE ALSO MANY PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT THE UCA COURAGEOUSLY FOLLOWS THE CHURCH'S SOCIAL DOCTRINE. THIS STATEMENT, IF MADE WITHOUT THE RESERVATION THAT IT ONLY REPRESENTS THE VIEWS OF A GROUP OF PEOPLE AND THE FACT THAT THE ARTICLE FORGETS TO MENTION THE MANY OTHERS DO NOT BELIEVE, IS IN OUR OPINION A MANIPULATION OF THE TRUTH. 3. THE POSITION OF THE PRIESTS WAS NOT "NEOMARXIST" IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL FIELD. FATHER ELLACURIA CAME FROM THE SCHOOL OF THE SPANISH PHILOSOPHER ZUBIRI, WHOSE THOUGHTS WERE DEEPLY ROOTED IN CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHY. FATHER AMANDO LOPEZ WROTE HIS DOCTORAL THESIS ON THE SPANISH PHILOSOPHER AND PRIEST AMOR RUIBAL. THE "ZUBIRIAN" INCLINATION OF FATHER ELLACURIA WAS INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN IN MOST PHILOSOPHICAL SCHOOLS. THOSE WHO ACCUSE THE MURDERED PRIESTS OF HAVING NEOMARXIST PHILOSOPHICAL POSITIONS ARE PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGING THEIR IGNORANCE. 4. STATEMENTS SUCH AS THESE, WHICH WERE REPEATED IN OTHER MEDIA BEFORE THE MURDER OF THE PRIESTS, PARTLY PROMOTED THEIR MURDER. WE THEREFORE CONSIDER THEIR REPETITION TO BE A VERY SERIOUS MATTER. ON PAGE 7, AND IN AN EDITORIAL ARTICLE, THE NEWSPAPER MENTIONS THE NEED TO AVOID "THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY PRIVATE PSEUDO-INVESTIGATIONS, WHEREVER THEY MIGHT COME FROM." ON THIS STATEMENT I WANT TO SIMPLY ADD THAT IN A CASE LIKE THIS THE INJURED PARTY HAS EVERY RIGHT, BOTH IN EL SALVADOR AND IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE WORLD, TO CONDUCT ITS OWN PRIVATE INVESTIGATION. FURTHERMORE, UNLESS PUBLICLY AND IRREFUTABLY PROVEN HARMFUL, NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO CONDEMN IT "IN ADVANCE" SAYING THAT IT IS PLAYING DETECTIVES. I BEG OF YOU MR. DIRECTOR, BASED ON THE RIGHT TO REPLY AND THE JUSTICE THAT THE MURDERED JESUITS AND THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN THEM DESERVE, THAT YOU PUBLISH THIS CLARIFICATIONS IN YOUR NEWSPAPER WITH THE SAME DESIRE TO REACH YOUR READERS AS THOSE WHO WROTE THE ARTICLES. YOURS TRULY. FATHER JOSE MARIA TOJEIRA SOCIETY OF JESUS PROVINCIAL."
DEV-MUC3-1034	TEGUCIGALPA, 31 DEC 89 -- COUNTRYMEN: NOW THAT THE NEW YEAR IS JUST MOMENTS AWAY, WE APPEAR BEFORE THE NATION, AS WE HAVE DONE IN THE PREVIOUS YEARS OF OUR ADMINISTRATION, TO EXPRESS OUR MOST SINCERE WISHES FOR THE PERSONAL WELL-BEING OF ALL HONDURAN PEOPLE. OUR GREATEST WISH IS FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL IN THE NATION, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, TO ENJOY WELL- BEING AND PEACE AT HOME. WE CAN AFFIRM THAT DURING OUR TENURE WE HAVE CONSTANTLY STRIVEN TOWARD THE HIGHER GOALS OF COLLECTIVE PROGRESS AND WELL-BEING IN THE SPECIFIC SITUATIONS WE HAVE FACED DURING THESE 4 YEARS OF GOVERNMENT -- SITUATIONS THAT ARE NATURAL TO A DEVELOPING COUNTRY LIKE OURS. ON 25 JANUARY 1990 WE WILL PRESENT TO CONGRESS A REPORT SUMMING UP THE ACHIEVEMENTS MADE DURING OUR ADMINISTRATION. THUS, ALL THE PEOPLE WILL BE TRUTHFULLY INFORMED OF OUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND OF THE PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN SO THAT THE HONDURAN PEOPLE CAN DEVELOP MATERIAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HISTORICAL EVOLUTION TO WHICH WE ASPIRE, BOTH AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS A STATE. WE HAVE EXPRESSED OUR DESIRE FOR PEACE AT SIX CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMITS, WHERE WE DEFENDED THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES AND CONDEMNED ANY FORM OF TOTALITARIANISM AS WELL AS THE TERRORIST ACTIONS THAT HAVE CAUSED MANY DEATHS AND BROUGHT SORROW TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEOPLE. I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT THE TELA SUMMIT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE SEARCH FOR PEACE AND DEMOCRACY IN CENTRAL AMERICA, ESPECIALLY IN THOSE COUNTRIES PLAGUED BY VIOLENCE. WE HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED THAT GREAT SACRIFICES ARE NECESSARY IF WE ARE TO MAKE SOCIAL PROGRESS, AND WE HAVE CONSTANTLY WORKED TO ESTABLISH THE NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR THE COUNTRY'S DEVELOPMENT. OUR ACHIEVEMENTS ARE LASTING AND HAVE GIVEN THE COUNTRY BETTER PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE. THAT HAS BEEN OUR MAIN OBJECTIVE. WE DID NOT RESORT TO DEMAGOGUERY, AND WE SPOKE THE TRUTH -- DURING THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN AND LATER AS THE LEADER OF THE NATION'S DESTINY -- SO AS NOT TO CREATE FALSE EXPECTATIONS AMONG THE PEOPLE. I WANT TO REASSERT THAT ONCE I STEP DOWN FROM THE PRESIDENCY, I WILL CONTINUE FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO STRIVE FOR THE UNITY OF THE HONDURAN PEOPLE SO THAT WITH EFFORT AND WORK WE MAY IMPROVE OUR LIVING STANDARDS. FINALLY I WANT TO EXPRESS MY SINCERE DESIRE FOR SUCCESS -- FOR THE WELL-BEING OF THE FATHERLAND -- TO RAFAEL LEONARDO CALLEJAS ROMERO, WHO WILL TAKE OFFICE AS PRESIDENT ON 27 JANUARY L990. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
DEV-MUC3-1035	MANAGUA , 2 JAN 90 -- THE PRESS AND INFORMATION DIRECTORATE OF THE PRESIDENCY ANNOUNCES TO THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE AND TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY REPORTS, ON 1 JANUARY AT 1930, A GROUP OF COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY MERCENARIES, FINANCED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, AMBUSHED MEMBERS OF A RELIGIOUS GROUP HEADED BY MSGR PABLO SMITH, BISHOP OF THE BLUEFIELDS APOSTOLIC VICARIATE, IN A PLACE KNOWN AS OJO DE AGUA, LOCATED BETWEEN ARANCHAMBA AND COPERNA, NORTHERN ATLANTIC REGION, RESULTING IN THE DEATH OF NUNS MAUREEN CONNALY, AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, AND TERESA ROSALES MISQUITA. BISHOP PABLO SMITH AND FRANCISCA COLOMER MISQUITA WERE SERIOUSLY WOUNDED. THIS IS PART OF THE ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, WHICH INVADED PANAMA AND CONDUCTED A MILITARY INCURSION INTO THE HOME OF THE NICARAGUAN AMBASSADOR IN THAT COUNTRY. THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT CONDEMNS THESE SERIOUS INCIDENTS, WHICH ENDANGER THE PEACE EFFORTS CONDUCTED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND SUPPORTED BY THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE. NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA SAAVEDRA CALLS ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND ON THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES TO CONDEMN THIS BRUTAL CRIME PERPETRATED AGAINST RELIGIOUS PEOPLE. THIS ACTION IS SIMILAR TO THE ASSASSINATION OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS PERPETRATED IN SAN SALVADOR ON 16 NOVEMBER 1989 BY THE SALVADORAN ARMY, WHICH JUST AS THE COUNTERREVOLUTION AND THE OTHER RIGHTIST NICARAGUAN FORCES, DEFENDS THE AGGRESSIVE POLICIES OF THE UNITED STATES. MANAGUA, 2 JANUARY 1990.
DEV-MUC3-1036	HAVANA , 4 JAN 90 -- THE BLOW DEALT TO THE LATIN AMERICAN CONSCIENCE BY THE U.S. INTERVENTION IN PANAMA IS ABOUT TO DEFLATE THE OPTIMISTIC HOPES FOR A JOINT STRUGGLE AGAINST THE DRUG TRADE. EVEN GEORGE BUSH'S 15 FEBRUARY MEETING IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS, COLOMBIA, WITH THE PRESIDENTS OF BOLIVIA, PERU, AND COLOMBIA -- THE LEADING PRODUCERS OF COCA LEAVES -- IS IN JEOPARDY. PERUVIAN CHIEF EXECUTIVE ALAN GARCIA MADE IT KNOWN THAT HE WILL NOT ATTEND THE MEETING IN PROTEST OF THE PANAMA INVASION. BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA IS BEING QUESTIONED BY THE BOLIVIAN SUPREME COURT OVER THE EXTRADITION TO THE UNITED STATES OF FORMER COLONEL LUIS ARCE GOMEZ. THE COURT REGARDS PAZ ZAMORA'S DECISION ON THIS MATTER AS UNDUE EXERCISE OF JURISDICTIONAL POWERS AND AN ATTACK ON THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. BOLIVIAN CHIEF JUSTICE EDGAR OBLITAS CHARGED THAT THE EXTRADITION OF ARCE GOMEZ, WHO WAS A NOTORIOUS DRUG TRAFFICKER, AN EXECUTIONER AND A PLOTTER, HAS PREVENTED THE AUTHORITIES FROM CLEARING UP SEVERAL RECENT EVENTS IN BOLIVIAN HISTORY, WHICH THUS REMAIN JUST PARTIALLY KNOWN. FOR ITS PART, COLOMBIA REACTED WITH SURPRISE AND INDIGNATION TO REPORTS THAT THE UNITED STATES PLANS TO ESTABLISH AIRSPACE AND NAVAL PATROLS WITHIN COLOMBIAN JURISDICTION WITHOUT CONSULTING WITH BOGOTA. THE WHITE HOUSE IN WASHINGTON STATED LATER THAT THE PATROLS WILL TAKE PLACE OVER INTERNATIONAL WATERS AND THAT THEY WILL ENTAIL CONCERTED ACTIONS. IT IS KNOWN, HOWEVER, THAT AN EVENTUAL BLOCKADE OF THE COLOMBIAN COAST IS PART OF A PACKAGE OF SPECIAL MEASURES COORDINATED BY U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY DICK CHENEY. THE COLOMBIAN POLICE, WHO HAVE BEEN CREDITED WITH SEIZING 80 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL ANNUAL AMOUNT OF COCAINE SEIZED WORLDWIDE, HAVE IN RECENT WEEKS DEALT SEVERE BLOWS TO THE MEDELLIN CARTEL DRUG LORDS. THE PUNITIVE U.S. ACTION WOULD IN PRACTICE ENTAIL THAT THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THESE ACHIEVEMENTS AND WOULD CREATE AN EMBARRASSING SITUATION FOR PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO IN A YEAR WHEN COLOMBIANS WILL ELECT A NEW PRESIDENT, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, MAYORS, DEPARTMENTAL DEPUTIES, AND COUNCILMEN. THE CLAIM THAT THE ACTION IS INTENDED TO MORE EFFECTIVELY PREVENT THE DRUG TRADE IS HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT IT WILL NOT BE MATCHED BY EQUIVALENT STIFF MEASURES IN THE COUNTRY HOLDING THE WORLD RECORD IN DRUG CONSUMPTION AND THAT U.S. TROOPS ARE CURRENTLY OCCUPYING COLOMBIA'S NEIGHBORING COUNTRY, PANAMA. WHERE DOES THE U.S. DESIRE TO CHASE CRIMINALS END AND WHERE DOES ITS IMPERIALIST DESIRE TO LIMIT LATIN AMERICAN SOVEREIGNTY AND TO DECIDE THE FATE OF OUR PEOPLES START? THE PANAMANIAN CASE IS AN EXAMPLE. IT IS NOT NOT ONLY LEGITIMATE BUT NECESSARY FOR US TO BE DISTRUSTFUL.
DEV-MUC3-1037	ASUNCION , 5 JAN 90 -- FIVE COLOMBIAN CITIZENS AND TWO ARGENTINES, INCLUDING A WOMAN, HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE INDIVIDUALS ALLEGEDLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE THEFT OF A LATN PLANE IN THE CHACO REGION ON 3 JANUARY. THE ARGENTINE WOMAN WAS WORKING IN A HOTEL AND HER ACCOMPLICES ENTERED THE COUNTRY AS TOURISTS IN AUGUST. ACCORDING TO THEIR HOTEL REGISTRATION FORMS, SOME OF THEM ARE VETERINARIANS AND OTHERS ARE TOUR GUIDES. ACCORDING TO A REPORT ON THE STOLEN TWO-ENGINE LATN CESSNA RELEASED DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE INVESTIGATIVE POLICE DEPARTMENT THIS MORNING, IT IS NOT KNOWN IF THE PLANE WAS INSURED. THE INDIVIDUALS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE THEFT WERE IDENTIFIED AS COLOMBIAN CITIZENS JUAN JOSE GILL, 33, JORGE QUEVEDO PAREDES, JUAN CARLOS MARIN, ALBERTO ECHEVERRY, AND ALVARO HUMBERTO BASTO MANCERA, AND ARGENTINE CITIZENS MIGUEL ANGEL ANZEVINO AND SILVANA ALEJANDRA NOVILLO, 24.
DEV-MUC3-1038	CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- THE VIOLENT AND SURPRISING EVENTS IN VENEZUELA AND ARGENTINA EARLIER IN THE YEAR, WHICH RESULTED IN THOUSANDS KILLED, ARE AN INDICATION OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN COMING YEARS. WITH ITS INTERVENTIONIST POLICY, THE UNITED STATES HAS NEGATED OUR PEOPLES' SELF - DETERMINATION AND EMBITTERED THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES IN THE AREA. BY PREVENTING THE SOCIAL FORCES FROM ACTING FREELY, THE UNITED STATES PROLONGS THE WAR AND ELIMINATES THE POSSIBILITY OF ACHIEVING TRUE DEMOCRATIZATION. THE U.S. IMPERIALIST POLICY HAS WEAKENED IN THE DECADE ENDING TODAY. LATIN AMERICANISM HAS ADVANCED AND THE TIME OF A DOCILE AND PUPPET CONTINENT HAS BEEN LEFT BEHIND. LATIN AMERICAN INTERESTS AND SOCIAL FORCES HAVE MATURED. DESPITE 30 YEARS OF INVASION AND COMMERCIAL FREEZING, CUBA IS STILL UNBEATEN. NICARAGUA HAS RESISTED, HAS DEFEATED 10 YEARS OF WAR WAGED BY MERCENARIES, AND IS PREPARING TO LEGITIMIZE ITS REVOLUTION. IN EL SALVADOR, THE 10 YEARS OF COUNTERINSURGENCY WITH WHICH THE UNITED STATES HAS TRIED TO DEFEAT US AND WHICH THE UNITED STATES HAS TRIED TO IMPOSE ON US HAVE FAILED. THE INSURGENCY PROBLEMS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY RESOLVED WITH A FEW ADVISERS AND IN A COUPLE OF YEARS REMAIN UNSETTLED IN EL SALVADOR DESPITE A $3 BILLION AID PACKAGE, NEARLY 1,000 ADVISERS, AND 10 YEARS OF BLOODY WAR. IN THE PAST THE PROBLEM OF PANAMA WOULD HAVE BEEN SETTLED WITH A COUP IN A FEW HOURS' TIME, BUT NOW 2 YEARS OF ECONOMIC FREEZING, SUBVERSION, BUSINESSMEN'S STRIKES, ATTACKS, AND THWARTED COUPS WERE NECESSARY. FINALLY, THE UNITED STATES HAD TO USE 30,000 MEN, DESTROY A COUNTRY, AND FIGHT FOR 1 WEEK TO BRING TO SUBMISSION AN ARMY AND A MILITARY HEAD THEY THEMSELVES HAD TRAINED. LATIN AMERICANISM IS ON ITS WAY FORWARD. THE DECADE NOW BEGINNING BELONGS TO LATIN AMERICA. THE STRUGGLE IN OUR CONTINENT IS OF AN ANTI-IMPERIALIST NATURE. OUR STRUGGLE, AS EVERYONE KNOWS, STARTED IN CENTRAL AMERICA 10 YEARS AGO WITH THE TRIUMPH OF THE SANDINIST REVOLUTION AND THE BEGINNING OF WAR IN OUR COUNTRY. THIS HAS TURNED THE REGION INTO A TRUE VIETNAM DURING THIS DECADE. BECAUSE OF ALL THIS, THE SACRIFICE THAT OUR STRUGGLE ENTAILS IS GREAT AND THE PROCESS IS COMPLEX, BECAUSE BOTH THE STRUGGLE AND THE PROCESS OCCUR IN A CHANGING WORLD SITUATION. WHILE IN EASTERN EUROPE THE AREAS OF INFLUENCE ARE DISAPPEARING AND THE PEOPLES' SELF - DETERMINATION IS OPENING TO AN UNHINDERED PATH, THE U.S. EMPIRE WALKS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND CLINGS TO ITS NEOCOLONIAL DOMINATION OF LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN. WHAT IS AT STAKE IN EL SALVADOR IS NOT PRECISELY COMMUNISM OR CAPITALISM, BUT DEMOCRACY AND THE CONTINENT'S INDEPENDENCE. LATIN AMERICA ASPIRES, NOT TO A RESTRICTED SOCIETY, BUT TO A SELF-SUFFICIENT DEVELOPMENT AND INTERNAL SOCIAL BALANCE WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF MANY SOCIAL SECTORS. THE CENTRAL AMERICAN SOCIETIES APPEAR TO BE POLARIZED IN THE EYES OF BOTH EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS, BUT THE NEED FOR INDEPENDENCE WILL COALESCE ALL OF THESE FORCES. IN THIS CONTEXT, OUR STRUGGLE, WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY FOR SELF - DETERMINATION AND DEMOCRACY, IS IN THE CAPITALIST WORLD THE SPEARHEAD OF THE STRUGGLE OF ALL LATIN AMERICAN AND THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES, WHICH DEMAND THESE TRANSFORMATIONS. ALL THAT OUR PEOPLE HAVE DONE THESE YEARS AND ALL THAT HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED BY OUR COMBATANTS, MILITARY COMMANDERS, POLITICAL LEADERS, AND THOSE WHO HAVE WORKED EITHER AS DIPLOMATS OR GUERRILLAS HAS NOW BECOME VERY SIGNIFICANT. THE CHANGES IN STRATEGY, THE RESHUFFLING OF PLANS, THE HEROIC RESISTANCE OF THE MASSES, THE UNITY OF THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT, THE POLITICAL - IDEOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY, THE DEFINITION OF A POLITICAL PLATFORM ADAPTED TO THE DEMAND OF THE STRUGGLE, THE LARGE NUMBER OF BOTH LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED, AND ALL THAT HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED WITH THE BLOOD OF THE BEST CHILDREN OF THE PEOPLE CONSTITUTE OUR FULL CONTRIBUTION TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF DEMOCRACY AND SOVEREIGNTY IN EL SALVADOR AND LATIN AMERICA AND HELP MAKE THE PEOPLE'S VICTORY MORE LIKELY THAN EVER.
DEV-MUC3-1039	SAN SALVADOR, 7 JAN 90 -- A LOCAL RADIO STATION REPORTED TODAY THAT A GROUP OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING MEMBERS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY, WERE ARRESTED IN THE LAST FEW HOURS BECAUSE OF THEIR SUSPECTED INVOLVEMENT IN THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX SPANISH JESUITS ON 16 NOVEMBER. CITING RELIABLE SOURCES, RADIO CADENA YSKL STATED THIS AFTERNOON THAT THE SUSPECTED ASSASSINS WERE ARRESTED AFTER THE INVESTIGATIONS OF THE CASE HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT. U.S., SPANISH, AND BRITISH INVESTIGATORS PARTICIPATED IN THE INVESTIGATIONS. IT HAS ALSO BEEN LEARNED THAT PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI WILL ADDRESS THE COUNTRY TONIGHT OVER A NATIONAL RADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK, PRESUMABLY TO REFER TO THIS SUBJECT.
DEV-MUC3-1040	SAN SALVADOR, 8 JAN 90 -- COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHIEF OF THE SALVADOAN ARMED FORCES' GENERAL STAFF, HAS ADMITTED THAT 2 OFFICERS AND 45 SOLDIERS OF AN ELITE BATTALION ARE "BEING HELD IN VARIOUS GUARRISONS OF SAN SALVADOR" WHILE INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE KILLING OF THE SIX JESUITS CONTINUE. ACCORDING TO PONCE, THESE OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS OF THE ATLACATL BATTALION WERE PLACED AT THE DISPOSITION OF THE CRIMES INVESTIGATIVE COMMISSION, WHICH IS STUDYING THE CASE OF THE JESUITS WHO WERE SHOT TO DEATH ON 16 NOVEMBER. SPANISH, BRITISH, FRENCH, AND CANADIAN POLICE AGENTS HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THESE INVESTIGATIONS. THESE SALVADORAN SOLDIERS HAD SEARCHED THE JESUITS' RESIDENCE 2 DAYS BEFORE THE KILLING, PONCE TOLD THE MEDIA TODAY WITHOUT GIVING MUCH DETAIL. HOWEVER, DIPLOMATIC SOURCES STATED THAT THE SOLDIERS WILL BE "CONFINED" TO THEIR RESPECTIVE GARRISONS AND ADDED THAT THEY INCLUDE "FIVE OFFICERS." FRANCISCO ESTRADA, A SALVADORAN PRIEST WHO WAS APPOINTED NEW RECTOR OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY , SAID THAT "THE PRESIDENT'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES COMMITTED THIS CRIME, IS AN IMPORTANT STEP VERY SELDOM TAKEN IN THIS COUNTRY." HOWEVER, THIS "MATTER IS NOT OVER WITH YET." "WHAT WOULD REALLY BE NEW IS FOR HIM TO SAY WHO DID IT, INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING THAT IT WAS THE ARMED FORCES," THE PRIEST TOLD ACAN-EFE AND ADDED THAT HE TRUSTS IN THE "GOODWILL AND ETHICS" OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI. EVERY SOURCE CONSULTED WITH BY ACAN-EFE, WHETHER DIPLOMATIC OR RELIGIOUS, AGREED TO SAY THAT NOW IT IS IMPORTANT FOR CRISTIANI TO TAKE ONE STEP FURTHER AND MENTION THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS MURDER CARRIED OUT AT UCA. TWO DOMESTIC SERVANTS WERE KILLED TOGETHER WITH THE CLERGYMEN, FIVE SPANIARDS, INCLUDING UCA RECTOR IGNACIO ELLACURIA, AND A SALVADORAN. THE U.S. EMBASSY IN EL SALVADOR ALSO CONGRATULATED CRISTIANI TODAY FOR HIS EFFORTS TO CLARIFY THE ASSASSINATION, AS U.S. CONGRESSMEN AND OFFICIALS OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAD ASKED OF HIM. IN FACT, DIPLOMATIC SOURCES COMMENTED TO ACAN-EFE THAT BEGINNING ON 22 JANUARY, THE U.S. CONGRESS IS TO DISCUSS A NEW $90 MILLION PACKAGE OF ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR THAT MIGHT HINGE ON THE STATUS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS. THE UNITED STATES HAS GIVEN OVER $3 BILLION IN MILITARY AND ECONOMIC AID TO EL SALVADOR OVER THE PAST DECADE, AND AT PRESENT IT IS GIVING ABOUT $1.4 MILLION DAILY, ACCORDING TO SALVADORAN POLITICAL SOURCES. UCA RECTOR FRANCISCO ESTRADA SAID THAT CRISTIANI COULD TAKE THIS STEP BECAUSE "HE IS CONFIDENT THAT HE CAN CONTROL ANY INTERNAL RESENTMENT WITHIN HIS GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES." A SIMILAR OPINION WAS EXPRESSED BY A EUROPEAN DIPLOMAT, WHO TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT CRISTIANI IS TAKING A GREAT RISK BY ACCUSING MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THIS CRIME. HE ADDED: " IF HE HAS DONE THIS, IT IS BECAUSE HE FEELS VERY SELF-CONFIDENT." OBSERVERS COMPARE THE INVESTIGATION BEING CARRIED OUT BY THE PRESENT RIGHTIST GOVERNMENT WITH ONE CARRIED OUT BY THE GOVERNMENT OF JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, A CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT, INTO THE 1980 MURDER OF SALVADORAN ARCHBISHOP OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO. DUARTE, WHO TURNED OVER POWER TO CRISTIANI ON 1 JUNE 1989, ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS ATTRIBUTED THE MURDER OF ARCHBISHOP ROMERO TO ROBERTO D' AUBUISSON, A PRESENT DEPUTY AND LEADER OF THE RULING NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE, BUT THE INVESTIGATIONS NEVER LED TO ANY CONCRETE RESULTS.
DEV-MUC3-1041	MADRID , 8 JAN 90 -- HERE IN MADRID, THE LEFT-WING LEADER OF THE SALVADORAN OPPOSITION, RUBEN ZAMORA, HAD A MEETING JUST A FEW MINUTES' AGO WITH FOREIGN MINISTER FRANCISCO FERNANDEZ ORDONEZ, BEFORE STARTING A EUROPEAN TOUR SEEKING AID TO OVERCOME THE CRISIS FACING THE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY. GLORIA DEL CAMPO REPORTS FROM THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, SANTA CRUZ PALACE: RUBEN ZAMORA BELIEVES THAT IF, AS IT HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED, OFFICIALS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY ARE TO BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUITS AND TWO EMPLOYEES OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY, IT WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS HAS BEEN DONE AND THAT, TO A LARGE EXTENT, THIS IS DUE TO THE PRESSURE OF COUNTRIES LIKE SPAIN, THE EEC, AND THE REST OF THE WORLD. BUT, SPEAKING TO RNE, RUBEN ZAMORA EXPRESSED HIS RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE REAL IDENTITY AND RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PERPETRATORS OF THE MASSACRE. PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HAS STILL NOT GIVEN ANY NAMES AND SO WE CAN'T SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE IT'S ALL BASED ON RUMORS. THEREFORE, THE FIRST THING TO BE SEEN IS WHO IS INVOLVED AND, SECONDLY, WHETHER THEY ARE REALLY BROUGHT TO TRIAL AND, THIRDLY, WHETHER THEY REALLY ARE SENTENCED FOR THE CRIME WHICH THEY HAVE COMMITTED. SO, THERE ARE STILL MANY OBSTACLES IN THE WAY BEFORE GIVING A FINAL OPINION ON THE MATTER. RUBEN ZAMORA HAD A 45-MINUTE MEETING WITH SPANISH FOREIGN MINISTER FRANCISCO FERNANDEZ ORDONEZ AT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY. HE EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR AND URGENCY OF A POLITICAL SOLUTION IN EL SALVADOR, OF AIDING -- THROUGH THE MEDIATION OF THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL -- NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GUERRILLAS. HE EXPLAINED THE SITUATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES IN EL SALVADOR AND THE NEED FOR THE POLITICAL ARENA TO BE OPENED UP TO PROMOTE THE PEACE PROCESS.
DEV-MUC3-1042	PANAMA CITY , 12 JAN 90 -- SOME 150 PEOPLE THREW STONES AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA CITY TODAY TO PROTEST THE PRESENCE AT THE EMBASSY OF 12 REFUGEES CLOSELY LINKED TO FORMER GENERAL MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA. RESIDENTS OF A NEARBY NEIGHBORHOOD GATHERED IN FRONT OF THE EMBASSY SHOUTING SLOGANS AGAINST THE MILITARY AND CIVILIAN REFUGEES, WHOM THEY SHOUTED SHOULD BE "SHOT," AND AGAINST THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT FOR GRANTING THEM ASYLUM. THE DEMONSTRATORS, WHO BROKE THE WINDSHIELDS OF SOME VEHICLES PASSING IN FRONT OF THE EMBASSY, WERE FORCED AWAY FROM THE FRONT OF THE EMBASSY BY MEMBERS OF THE PANAMANIAN PUBLIC FORCE AND U.S. SOLDIERS. THE PANAMANIANS WHO SOUGHT SHELTER AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY ARE MAJOR EDGARDO LOPEZ GRIMALDO, SPOKESMEN OF THE FORMER DEFENSE FORCES; MAJOR GONZALO GONZALEZ, CHIEF OF THE ELITE "MACHO DE MONTE" COMPANY; NORIEGA'S FORMER SECRETARY, MARCELA TASON; CAPTAIN NARCISA CASTILLERO; MAJOR HERACLIDES SUCRE; AND SEVEN RELATIVES OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PEOPLE. SUCRE WAS CHARGED TODAY BY PANAMANIAN ATTORNEY GENERAL ROGELIO CRUZ WITH BEING INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF MAJOR MOISES GIROLDI, WHO PROMOTED A FOILED COUP AGAINST NORIEGA ON 3 OCTOBER 1989. PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA TODAY EXPRESSED HIS WILLINGNESS TO PROTECT "AS LONG AS NECESSARY" THE FORMER NORIEGA AIDES WHO SOUGHT SHELTER AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA. PERU ANNOUNCED ON 9 JANUARY THAT IT HAS GRANTED ASYLUM TO FIVE PANAMANIAN MILITARY AND SEVEN OF THEIR RELATIVES. THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT SAID ON 12 JANUARY THAT IT WILL NOT GRANT SAFE-CONDUCT FOR THESE PEOPLE, WHOM IT CONSIDERS "COMMON CRIMINALS," TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ON 11 JANUARY SAID THE PANAMANIAN PUBLIC FORCE IS IN CHARGE OF GUARDING THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY AND POINTED OUT THAT THE SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS POSED BY THE PRESENCE OF THE REFUGEES SHOULD BE HANDLED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF PANAMA AND PERU. THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT SAID TODAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF PANAMANIAN PRESIDENT GUILLERMO ENDARA IS "UNLAWFUL." HE ADDED THAT PANAMA IS BEING RULED BY "THE STATE DEPARTMENT, THE PENTAGON, THE SOUTHERN COMMAND, AND THE U.S. TROOPS."
DEV-MUC3-1043	SAN SALVADOR, 10 JAN 90 -- A MILITARY SOURCE, QUOTING INTELLIGENCE SOURCES, SAID TODAY THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS HAVE ABANDONED THEIR STRICTLY MILITARY GOALS TO INSTEAD DIRECT THEIR ACTIONS AGAINST ECONOMIC TARGETS, WITHIN THEIR USUAL PATTERN OF WEARING DOWN THE ECONOMY. THE SOURCE ATTRIBUTED THE CHANGE IN TACTICS TO THE "FAILURE" OF THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT ON 11 NOVEMBER, IN WHICH SIX GUERRILLA COMMANDERS AND ALL GUERRILLA TROOPS TOOK PART. ACCORDING TO THE FMLN, THE OFFENSIVE'S GOAL WAS TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE GOVERNMENT ON A "ONE-TO-ONE" BASIS. IN THE OPINION OF THE ARMY, HOWEVER, THE FMLN WAS TRYING TO CAUSE AN INSURRECTION AMONG THE PEOPLE TO GRAB POWER. THE SOURCE, WHO REQUESTED ANONYMITY, TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT FOLLOWING THE OFFENSIVE, THE FMLN DECIDED TO "READAPT" THEIR MILITARY CADRES TO THE TRADITIONAL "PROLONGED PEOPLE'S WAR." MILITARY INTELLIGENCE BELIEVES THAT WITH THIS CHANGE IN TACTICS, THE GUERRILLAS ARE TRYING TO "MAINTAIN THEIR MILITARY PRESENCE AND THUS RAISE THE FIGHTERS MORALE FOLLOWING THE DISBANDING OF IMPORTANT MILITARY CADRES." FOLLOWING THE SUSPENSION OF THE UNILATERAL TRUCE DECREED BY THE FMLN BETWEEN 23 DECEMBER AND 2 JANUARY, THE GUERRILLAS RESTARTED THEIR ACTIONS AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY BY BLOWING-UP THE COUNTRY'S POWER GRID AND SHOPS IN SAN SALVADOR. ECONOMIC LOSSES LAST YEAR DUE TO GUERRILLA SABOTAGE TO THE TRANSPORT, POWER AND TELEPHONE SYSTEMS, AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURES SURPASSED $100 MILLION, ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SOURCES. THE SOURCE SAID THAT THE MILITARY RESTRUCTURE ENCOMPASSED THE SIX ORGANIZATIONS THAT COMPRISE THE FMLN: THE REVOLUTIONARY PARTY OF CENTRAL AMERICAN WORKERS , THE NATIONAL RESISTANCE , THE SALVADORAN COMMUNIST PARTY , THE POPULAR LIBERATION FORCES , THE ARMED FORCES OF LIBERATION , AND THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY ARMY . ACCORDING TO MILITARY INTELLIGENCE, THE PRTC, RN, AND THE PCS NOW OPERATE IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER IMPORTANT CITIES OF THE COUNTRY, WHILE THE FPL OPERATES IN THE CENTRAL REGION, THE ERP IN THE NORTHEAST, AND THE FAL IN THE SOUTHEAST.
DEV-MUC3-1044	PANAMA CITY , 13 JAN 90 -- SOME 150 PERSONS PICKETED AND THREW STONES AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY ON 12 JANUARY. THE DEMONSTRATORS DEMANDED THAT FORMER PANAMA DEFENSE FORCES MAJOR EDGARDO LOPEZ GRIMALDO, AND OTHERS CLOSELY LINKED TO THE FORMER MILITARY REGIME WHO SOUGHT REFUGE AT THE EMBASSY, BE ASKED TO LEAVE THE MISSION. THE DEMONSTRATORS SHOUTED SLOGANS AGAINST NORIEGA AND THREW SOME STONES. THEY BROKE THE REAR WINDSHIELDS OF TWO DIPLOMATIC VEHICLES PARKED IN FRONT OF THE EMBASSY: A WHITE MITSUBISHI, LICENSE PLATES CD-325, AND A RED MITSUBISHI, LICENSE PLATES CD-142. "GRIMALDO...COWARD KILLER, COME OUT AND SHOW YOUR FACE," THE CROWD SHOUTED WHILE THE U.S. SOLDIERS GUARDING THE MISSION GENTLY MOVED THEM IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SIDEWALK ACROSS THE STREET. SOME EIGHT MEMBERS OF THE NEW PANAMANIAN PUBLIC FORCE, ALSO GUARDING THE EMBASSY, DID NOT INTERVENE. DESPITE THE SHOUTS DEMANDING "JUSTICE AND PRISON" FOR NORIEGA'S FOLLOWERS, NO ONE CAME OUT OF THE EMBASSY LOCATED ON "F" STREET, EL CANGREJO, A MIDDLE-CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD IN PANAMA CITY. MAJOR GONZALO GONZALEZ, COMMANDER OF THE ELITE "MACHO DE MONTE" COMPANY THAT FOILED THE 3 OCTOBER COUP AGAINST NORIEGA; HERACLIDES SUCRE, WHO HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE TWO OFFICERS WHO "SHOT" MOISES GIROLDI; AND MARCELA TASON, NORIEGA'S PERSONAL SECRETARY ARE ALSO AT THE EMBASSY WITH LOPEZ GRIMALDO, WHO WAS THE SPOKESMAN FOR THE DISMANTLED FDP. APPROXIMATELY 40 U.S. SOLDIERS, SUPPORTED BY AN ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER AND THREE "HUMMER" ARMORED VEHICLES, ARE GUARDING THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY. AT THE TIME OF THE DEMOSTRATIONS, RESIDENTS IN NEARBY BUILDINGS WAVED WHITE HANDERCHIEFS AND BANGED POTS AND PANS, AND EMPTY CANS. A SIMILAR SITUATION WAS OCCURRING ON THE STREET. ONE OF THE DEMONSTRATORS TOLD LA PRENSA: "WE WILL STAY HERE UNTIL THEY COME OUT BECAUSE THEY MUST PAY FOR THEIR CRIMES; WE WILL COME BACK HERE EVERY AFTERNOON." THE U.S. SOLDIERS CORDONED OFF THE AREA WITH CONCERTINA WIRE WHILE A GROUP OF PEOPLE "BOOED" THEM FOR DOING THIS.
DEV-MUC3-1045	BOGOTA, 13 JAN 90 -- COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS SIMMONDS SAID ON 12 JANUARY THAT AS LONG AS THE GUERRILLA GROUPS CONTINUE TO RESPOND TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PEACE EFFORTS WITH MILITARY ACTIONS, THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE WILL ALSO HAVE TO RESPOND MILITARILY. MINISTER LEMOS WAS REFERRING TO THE CURRENT ATTACKS WHICH HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED BY SEVERAL REBEL GROUPS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. MINISTER LEMOS SAID THAT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IS WORRIED ABOUT THE COUNTRY'S PUBLIC ORDER, AND ADDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO USE THE ARMY AND THE POLICE TO FIGHT VIOLENCE. LIKEWISE, LEMOS SIMMONDS DESCRIBED THE GUERRILLA GROUPS STILL LAUNCHING ATTACKS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AS ANACHRONIC AND OUT-DATED. HE SAID THAT WE HOPE THIS SITUATION WILL CHANGE SOON, AND STRESSED THAT SEEING WHAT IS HAPPENING IN EASTERN EUROPE, WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY MANY OF THE REBEL GROUPS ARE BENT ON IMPOSING A SYSTEM THAT THEY CONSIDER IDEAL WHEN IT IS BEING REJECTED AND REPUDIATED BY SO MANY STATES THAT IMPOSED IT. MINISTER LEMOS SAID THAT THE THE GUERRILLA ACTION SHOULD BE UP-DATED; THE REBELS SHOULD STOP AND CONSIDER WHETHER THE STRUGGLE THEY ARE WAGING IS WORTH IT SINCE THE SYSTEM THEY ARE DEFENDING IS SOMETHING OF THE PAST. MINISTER LEMOS ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE WAVE OF KIDNAPPINGS THAT IS ROCKING THE COUNTRY. HE SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND DEFENSE MINISTRIES ARE TAKING SPECIAL MEASURES TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION. HE SAID THAT WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO JUSTIFY THE USE OF KIDNAPPING AS A POLITICAL WEAPON AND ADDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL DEAL WITH ALL THOSE INVOLVED IN KIDNAPPINGS AS COMMON CRIMINALS. THE MINISTER ALSO ASKED THE PEOPLE TO COOPERATE WITH THE AUTHORITIES IN LOCATING THOSE AREAS WHERE THE BANDS OF CRIMINALS ARE OPERATING. THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER ALSO TALKED ABOUT A DIALOGUE WITH THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA, FARC, AND SAID THAT TALKING ABOUT A DIALOGUE IS USELESS IF THEY CONTINUE THEIR SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES.
DEV-MUC3-1046	SAN SALVADOR, 13 JAN 90 -- SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI TODAY CHARGED THAT COLONEL GUILLERMO BENAVIDES, DIRECTOR OF THE MILITARY ACADEMY, TWO LIEUTENANTS, TWO SECOND LIEUTENANTS, TWO SUBSERGEANTS, ONE CORPORAL, AND TWO SOLDIERS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES ARE IMPLICATED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUITS. PRESIDENT CRISTIANI DENOUNCED THE MILITARY MEN ON A RADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK. HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL HUMBERTO LARIOS, COLONEL RENE PONCE, CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES STAFF, AND DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTERS COLONEL ORLANDO ZEPEDA AND COLONEL ORLANDO MONTANO. THE MILITARY MEN ARE SUSPECTED OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE ASSASSINATION OF CENTRAL AMERICA UNIVERSITY RECTOR IGNACIO ELLACURIA, FIVE OTHER JESUITS, AND TWO WOMEN IN SAN SALVADOR ON 16 NOVEMBER, WHILE THE CURFEW WAS IN FORCE.
DEV-MUC3-1047	NO CITY , NO DATE -- NOW THAT THE INVESTIGATION HAS ADVANCED TO A SIGNIFICANT POINT, I BELIEVE THE TIME IS RIGHT TO SAY THAT THE RESULTS OBTAINED THUS FAR RESPOND TO THE WIDESPREAD OUTCRY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE - - IN THE SENSE THAT THOSE CHARGED WITH CRIMINAL ACTIONS STAND TRIAL SO CRIMINALS ARE NOT LEFT UNPUNISHED. THIS IS THE COMMITMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND THE ARMED FORCES. HOWEVER, IT IS WISE TO CLARIFY THAT, IN THE SAME MANNER THAT PEOPLE HAVE MADE DEMANDS AND CONDEMNED THE CASE AT ISSUE TODAY, ACTIONS RESULTING FROM THE WAVE OF FMLN TERRORIST VIOLENCE SHOULD ALSO BE CONDEMNED AND PUNISHED WITH THE SAME VEHEMENCE. IN THE SAME MANNER, AGAIN WE WANT TO URGE ALL SALVADORANS TO ABSTAIN FROM SPECULATING OVER THESE REGRETTABLE INCIDENTS, BECAUSE THAT WILL ONLY HINDER THE JUDICIAL PROCESS. IT IS NECESSARY THAT LAW AND JUSTICE PREVAIL IN OUR COUNTRY, SO THAT NO ONE TRAMPLES ON THEM. IN REGARD TO THIS INVESTIGATION, WE WISH TO REAFFIRM THAT AN OBJECTIVITY HAS PREVAILED AT ALL TIMES, AND THAT THE ACCUSED WILL BE SENT TO THE PERTINENT COURT SO THAT THEY STAND TRIAL ACCORDING TO THE MECHANISMS ESTABLISHED IN THE CONSTITUTION AND IN OTHER LAWS. IN CONCLUSION, WE WANT TO TELL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE THAT, ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THIS IS A REGRETTABLE INCIDENT, WE MUST ACCEPT IT AS AN UNAVOIDABLE REALITY AND AS EVIDENCE TO THE WORLD THAT WE SALVADORANS AND OUR INSTITUTIONS HAVE A HIGH SENSE OF JUSTICE, MORALITY, AND ETHICS. AS COMMANDER OF THE ARMED FORCES, I WANT TO CONGRATULATE ALL ITS MEMBERS FOR THEIR PROFESSIONALISM, DEDICATION, AND EXEMPLARY CONDUCT, EVIDENCED NOT ONLY IN VIEW OF THIS INCIDENT, BUT ALSO BY HALTING -- IN DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY AND PEACE -- THE FMLN TERRORIST AGGRESSION. THAT BRILLIANT HISTORIC EVENT WILL ALWAYS BE PRESENT IN THE HEARTS OF OUR PEOPLE, WHO WILL RENDER HOMAGE TO THE ARMED FORCES FOR HAVING PROTECTED THE FREEDOM OF OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MAY GOD BLESS YOU.
DEV-MUC3-1048	SAN JOSE , 15 JAN 90 -- COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS TODAY URGED GUATEMALA PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO TO FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND ORDER AN "EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATION INTO THE MURDER OF SALVADORAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES IN GUATEMALA 2 DAYS AGO. ARIAS SAID: "I HOPE PRESIDENT CEREZO WILL DUPLICATE THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY HIS COUNTERPART ALFREDO CRISTIANI IN THE CASE OF THE JESUITS WHO WERE SAVAGELY KILLED 2 MONTHS AGO IN EL SALVADOR." THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT HARSHLY CRITICIZED "HECTOR OQUELI'S MURDERERS. THIS IS A HORRIBLE CRIME," HE SAID. THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT IS VERY MOVED BY THE MURDER OF OQUELI, BECAUSE THEY STUDIED TOGETHER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ESSEX, GREAT BRITAIN, 22 YEARS AGO, WHEN ARIAS OBTAINED HIS DOCTORATE. "HE WAS A GREAT FRIEND AND COMRADE," ARIAS SAID, RECALLING THE DEEDS OF THE MURDERED SALVADORAN POLITICIAN, WHO VISITED COSTA RICA SEVERAL TIMES TO PARTICIPATE IN LECTURES, SEMINARS, AND DISCUSSIONS.
DEV-MUC3-1049	BOGOTA, 17 JAN 90 -- THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS OFFERED FULL GUARANTEES OF DUE PROCESS TO DRUG TRAFFICKERS WHO LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND STOP THEIR TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AND SMUGGLING OF DRUGS TO OTHER COUNTRIES, BUT SAID IT WILL NOT ENTER INTO DEALS WITH THEM THAT MAY VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION OR THE LAWS. THE STATEMENT, WHICH WAS THE FIRST TO BE MADE BY AN OFFICIAL SOURCE, WAS MADE BY GOVERNMENT MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS TO A TELEVISION NEWSCAST. COMMENTING ON THE COMMUNIQUE IN WHICH THE EXTRADITABLES OFFER TO END THEIR ILLEGAL TRADE, RELEASE THE HOSTAGES THEY ARE HOLDING, AND STOP THEIR ATTACKS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY "RESPECT FOR OUR RIGHTS AND RETURN TO OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES," LEMOS SAID: "THE COLOMBIAN CONSTITUTION AND LAWS GUARANTEE A DUE PROCESS AND RIGHT TO DEFENSE, BUT OF COURSE THEY ALSO DEMAND THAT THOSE WHO BREAK THE LAWS SUBMIT TO THEM SO THAT, THROUGH THE JUDGES AND INDEPENDENT OF ANY INTERVENTION BY THE GOVERNMENT, THE DEGREE OF RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH ONE OF THEM AND WHETHER THERE ARE GROUNDS FOR PUNISHMENT CAN BE DETERMINED." HE ADDED: "THESE PERSONS, THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WILL ENJOY FULL LEGAL GUARANTEES, BUT THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THERE WILL BE COMPROMISES OF ANY KIND, BECAUSE THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION." EXPLAINING THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS WON THIS WAR ON THE BASIS OF MAKING NO CONCESSIONS, LEMOS SAID: "I DO NOT SEE ANY REASON TO CHANGE OUR POLICY OF NOT NEGOTIATING WHEN OUR OWN ENEMIES HAVE SAID THAT THIS POLICY HAS TRIUMPHED." IN THEIR COMMUNIQUE, WHICH WAS DELIVERED THROUGH TWO WOMEN WHO WERE KIDNAPPED AND RELEASED IN MEDELLIN, SEAT OF THE CARTEL BY THE SAME NAME, THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS RECOGNIZED THE STATE'S VICTORY OVER THE CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION AND AT THE SAME TIME OFFERED TO ABIDE BY THE LAWS.
DEV-MUC3-1050	SAN SALVADOR, 17 JAN 90 -- A FIERCE CLASH, WHICH LASTED ALMOST 1 HOUR, OCCURRED THIS EVENING BETWEEN GOVERNMENT SOLDIERS AND GUERRILLA FORCES IN A WESTERN SECTOR OF THE CAPITAL, BUT NO CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED. A MILITARY SOURCE FROM THE SECTOR SAID THAT THE CLASH OCCURRED IN MONTEBELLO NEIGHBORHOOD, LOCATED IN THE WESTERN SECTION OF THE CAPITAL, AND MUCH RIFLE FIRE AND MANY POWERFUL EXPLOSIONS WERE HEARD. THE MONTEBELLO NEIGHBORHOOD IS A MIDDLE-CLASS RESIDENTIAL AREA LOCATED NEAR THE EXCLUSIVE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH WAS THE SITE OF FIERCE FIGHTING DURING THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA GENERAL OFFENSIVE IN NOVEMBER. THE SOURCE INDICATED THAT THE ARMED CLASH BEGAN AT 2000 WHEN AN ARMY UNIT PATROLLING THE WESTERN AREA OF SAN SALVADOR SURPRISED A FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT COLUMN ADVANCING THROUGH THE SECTOR. THE CLASH ENDED 50 MINUTES LATER AND MILITARY SOURCES HAVE REPORTED NO CASUALTIES ON EITHER SIDE. RESIDENTS IN SEVERAL NEIGHBORHOODS SAID THAT THE FIRING OF VARIOUS CALIBER WEAPONS WAS HEARD THROUGHOUT ALMOST ALL THE WESTERN AND NORTHWESTERN ZONES OF THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL.
DEV-MUC3-1051	PANAMA CITY , 17 JAN 90 -- DIPLOMATIC SOURCES HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT LUIS SANDIGA, CHARGE D'AFFAIRES AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA, LEFT FOR LIMA TODAY FOLLOWING HIS EXPULSION YESTERDAY BY THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT. DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER JUAN MANUEL CASTULOVICH ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY THAT SANDIGA HAD BEEN GIVEN 72 HOURS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND EXPLAINED THAT HIS EXPULSION WAS THE RESULT OF STATEMENTS BY PERUVIAN AUTHORITIES WHO DENIED THE LEGITIMACY OF THE NEW PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT HEADED BY GUILLERMO ENDARA. ENDARA TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE FOLLOWING THE INVASION OF PANAMA BY U.S. TROOPS WHO TOPPLED GENERAL MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA'S REGIME. CASTULOVICH DENIED TODAY THAT PANAMA PLANS TO BREAK DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH PERU, AND INSISTED THAT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY, WHERE 11 OF NORIEGA'S AIDES HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE, "IS ASSURED OF ALL THE DIPLOMATIC GUARANTEES." NEVERTHELESS, CASTULOVICH REITERATED THAT THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT "WILL NOT ISSUE SAFE-CONDUCTS TO INDIVIDUALS ACCUSED AS COMMON CRIMINALS." AMONG THE REFUGEES ARE FOUR OFFICERS OF THE DISBANDED PANAMA DEFENSE FORCES. ONE OF THEM, HERACLIDES SUCRE, HAS BEEN LINKED BY PANAMA'S ATTORNEY GENERAL ROGELIO CRUZ TO THE MURDER OF MAJOR MOISES GIROLDI, AN OFFICER WHO WAS KILLED AFTER LEADING A THWARTED COUP ATTEMPT AGAINST NORIEGA ON 3 OCTOBER.
DEV-MUC3-1052	BOGOTA, 17 JAN 90 -- ON LEARNING OF THE EXTRADITABLES' STATEMENT CONCERNING THE RELEASE OF KIDNAPPED PERSONS AND THE SUSPENSION OF DRUG- TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES, GOVERNMENT MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS SIMMONDS, EXPRESSING HIS SATISFACTION, SAID TODAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS WON THE WAR AGAINST DRUG-TRAFFICKING WITHOUT ENGAGING IN ANY NEGOTIATIONS. I AM VERY PLEASED, KNOWING THAT WE HAVE FULFILLED OUR DUTIES AND THAT THE AUTHORITIES WHO IMPLEMENTED THE NO-DEAL POLICY HAVE WON A WAR THAT MANY BELIEVED HAD BEEN LOST. MINISTER LEMOS SIMMONDS ALSO SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT REVERSE ITS EXTRADITION POLICY BECAUSE EXTRADITIONS ARE A LEGAL TOOL THAT HAS BEEN IN EFFECT IN COLOMBIA SINCE 1888. I SIGNED THE DECREE THAT REESTABLISHED ADMINISTRATIVE EXTRADITION PROCEDURES, AND I SIGNED IT WITH COMPLETE AWARENESS. I CANNOT SAY ANYTHING DIFFERENT NOW FROM WHAT I SAID 4 OR 5 MONTHS AGO. THE MINISTER SAID THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT NEGOTIATE WITH THE DRUG-TRAFFICKERS, BUT ALSO WILL NOT ACT ARROGANTLY IN DEFEATING THEM. HE ADDED THAT NEW MEASURES AIMED AT STOPPING KIDNAPPINGS IN THE COUNTRY ARE BEING STUDIED. OF COURSE NOT ALL THE KIDNAPPED PEOPLE HAVE BEEN RELEASED. LET US HOPE THAT THE DRUG-TRAFFICKERS AND EXTRADITABLES' PROMISE -- THAT NO ONE WILL BE KIDNAPPED AGAIN -- IS KEPT. THE TRUTH IS I CANNOT SAY THAT THERE WILL BE NO MORE KIDNAPPINGS. THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY OF SUSPENDING THE EXTRADITION OF DRUG-TRAFFICKERS TO THE UNITED STATES IF THEY PUT DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND SUSPEND THEIR DRUG SHIPMENTS ABROAD.
DEV-MUC3-1053	LA PAZ, 17 JAN 90 -- AFTER LISTENING TO REPORTS SUBMITTED BY THE INTERIOR AND FOREIGN MINISTERS, THE BOLIVIAN SENATE TODAY APPROVED THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO EXTRADITE COLONEL LUIS ARCE GOMEZ TO THE UNITED STATES, WHERE HE FACES CHARGES OF DRUG TRAFFICKING.

A RECENT REPORT PUBLISHED BY AMNESTY STATED THAT TORTURE, MURDER, RAPE, AND DISAPPEARANCES WERE METHODS ADOPTED BY THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT IN COMBATING VIOLENT OPPOSITION GROUPS LIKE THE "SHINING PATH" GUERRILLAS. IT SAID MOST OF THE VICTIMS WERE SECONDARY SCHOOL CHILDREN WHO ARE A MAJOR RECRUITMENT TARGET FOR THE SHINING PATH. THE BARBADOS-BASED CARIBBEAN RIGHTS STRESSED IN ITS CABLE THAT IT WAS AWARE OF THE PROBLEMS THE GOVERNMENT WAS FACING WITH THE GUERRILLAS BUT EMPHASISED THAT IT WAS THE ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT TO UPHOLD LAW EVEN IN THE FACE OF VIOLENT OPPOSITION.
DEV-MUC3-1055	CARACAS , 19 JAN 90 -- WE ALREADY HAVE AUDIO AND VIDEO SIGNALS WITH LIMA AND LA PAZ. WE TALKED WITH PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA A FEW MINUTES AGO. GOOD MORNING AGAIN PRESIDENT GARCIA. GOOD MORNING PRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA. CAN YOU HEAR ME? YES, I CAN HEAR YOU. GOOD MORNING, NAPOLEON BRAVO. IT IS MY PLEASURE TO BE TALKING TO YOU TODAY. IT IS ALSO A PLEASURE FOR US. WE HAVE TEODORO PETKOFF, LEADER OF MAS HERE IN THE STUDIO. AS YOU, PRESIDENT GARCIA, AND TEODORO PETKOFF AGREED, THE TOPIC TO BE DISCUSSED HERE TODAY IS LATIN AMERICA'S FUTURE OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS. YOU WILL DISCUSS THE INCREASING IMPOVERISHMENT OF THE CONTINENT, THE POPULATION EXPLOSION, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE FIRST QUESTION IS FOR PRESIDENT GARCIA. MR PRESIDENT, IN YOUR OPINION AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT LATIN AMERICA IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING, INCLUDING THE FOREIGN DEBT AND ECONOMIC STAGNATION, WHAT CAN LATIN AMERICA EXPECT OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS? SOCIALISM, I HAVE, HOWEVER, DIFFICULT REGARDING LATIN AMERICA'S FUTURE. WE CANNOT THE FOREIGN DEBT EXPLOITATION OF OUR COUNTRIES OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS. WE CANNOT FORGET THAT OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS, LATIN AMERICA HAS BEEN EXPORTING CAPITAL AND THAT PAID $250 BILLION OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS , $430,000 AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE DECADE $190,000. POLITICAL AND MILITARY INTERVENTIONISM WHICH THE CASE OF PANAMA CONFIRMS. DEMOCRATIC OR TOTALITARIAN SOCIETIES AND ALL ENDANGERS THE VERY EXISTENCE OF LATIN AMERICA INSOFAR AS THERE IS NOT A PROMPT AND VIGOROUS REACTION FROM ALL THE LATIN AMERICAN POLITICAL LEADERS TO STRENGTHEN OUR PEOPLES' UNITY. THAT UNITY WILL SERVE AS AN ANTI-IMPERIALIST INSTRUMENT OF DEFENSE AND AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR OUR CONTINENT OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS. THAT IS THE ESSENTIAL PROTEST OF ALL THE LATIN AMERICAN MOVEMENTS THAT EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM, RESPECT FOR LATIN AMERICAN FREEDOM, AND ESPECIALLY RESPECT FOR LATIN AMERICAN UNITY. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. PRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA, I AM GOING TO ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTION. IN YOUR OPINION, AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE INCREASING IMPOVERISHMENT IN LATIN AMERICA, POPULATION EXPLOSION, THE DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM, THE CURRENT LATIN AMERICAN ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND THE FOREIGN DEBT PROBLEM, ABOUT WHICH IN FACT I THINK I HEARD -- AND I SAY I THINK, BECAUSE IT WAS TOO EARLY IN THE MORNING -- OVER THE ECO LATIN AMERICAN TELEVISION NETWORK THIS MORNING THAT YOU ARE SOLVING THE FOREIGN DEBT PROBLEM, WHAT IS LATIN AMERICA'S FUTURE FOR THE LAST DECADE OF THIS CENTURY? MY FRIEND NAPOLEON BRAVO, I HAVE A FAIRLY OPTIMISTIC VIEWPOINT WITH REGARD TO LATIN AMERICA'S FUTURE FOR THIS LAST DECADE OF THE CENTURY. I BELIEVE WE MUST ADMIT THAT DESPITE ALL THE DIFFICULTIES, THE FOREIGN DEBT PROBLEM, THE MISERY THAT EXISTS ON OUR CONTINENT, THE POPULATION EXPLOSION, AND OTHER PROBLEMS, SINCE THE LATIN AMERICAN REPUBLICS WERE FORMED, OUR CONTINENT HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER THAN TODAY. IN OTHER WORDS, SINCE THE LATIN AMERICAN REPUBLICS WERE FORMED, WE HAVE NEVER HAD ALMOST 90 PERCENT OF THE CONTINENT LIVING WITHIN DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS AS WE DO NOW. WE HAVE NEVER HAD THE PERSPECTIVES WE HAD TODAY. I AM OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE OF MY COUNTRY, OF LATIN AMERICA, AND ESPECIALLY OF OUR THREE COUNTRIES. I AM SO OPTIMISTIC THAT I EVEN WANT TO POINT OUT SOMETHING THAT TOUCHES OUR SOULS. WE WILL BEGIN THE DECADE BY WINNING THE WORLD SOCCER CHAMPIONSHIP IN ITALY. WE MUST NOT UNDERESTIMATE SOCCER, BECAUSE SOCCER IS CULTURE, TOO, AND REPRESENTS OUR PEOPLES' STRENGTH. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT MINE IS AN OPTIMISTIC POINT OF VIEW, I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU THAT OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS, LATIN AMERICA WILL FACE A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS. ONE OF THOSE PROBLEMS WILL BE TO FIND A WAY TO REJOIN AN ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL, AND COMMERCIAL WORLD FROM WHICH LATIN AMERICA WAS GRADUALLY EXPELLED DURING THE LAST DECADE AND EVEN DURING THE 1970'S.

THE STATEMENTS BY FOUR FORMER COLOMBIAN PRESIDENTS, BY THE CARDINAL AND ARCHBISHOP OF COLOMBIA, AND BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION ARE PATRIOTIC ACTIONS INTENDED TO SPARE COLOMBIANS MORE SUFFERING AND PAIN. THE GOVERNMENT HIGHLY APPRECIATES THE MEANING OF THOSE STATEMENTS. THOSE STATEMENTS REPRESENT THE THREE COLOMBIAN PARTIES AND THE CHURCH. 5. THE COUNTRY HAS ACTED WITH CALM, CAUTION, REALISM, AND RESPONSIBILITY. THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE DID NOT LET THEMSELVES BE CARRIED AWAY BY RECKLESS EXPECTATIONS. THE COUNTRY MUST MAINTAIN THAT ATTITUDE. 6. AUTHORIZED MEDIA SPOKESMEN HAVE MENTIONED THE MANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE ASK THEMSELVES CONCERNING THAT SITUATION, WHICH ONLY THE FUTURE CAN CONVINCINGLY CLARIFY. 7. THE COUNTRY LONGS FOR THE COMPLETE END TO CRIMES, MURDERS, AND ATTACKS AGAINST PUBLIC OFFICIALS, NEWSMEN, POLITICAL LEADERS, AND MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN. THE COUNTRY LONGS FOR THE RELEASE OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ABDUCTED AND THE DEFINITIVE SUSPENSION OF DRUG TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES. THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY AND THE ENORMOUS SACRIFICES COURAGEOUSLY MADE BY THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE SEEK THOSE OBJECTIVES, AMONG OTHER THINGS. 8. NOW THAT THE STATE'S VICTORY AND THE NEED TO ABIDE BY THE COUNTRY'S LAW ARE ADMITTED, WE MUST WALK ALONG THE BEST PATH TO ENSURE THE FINAL SUCCESS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY, WHICH HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.

DEV-MUC3-1060	SAN SALVADOR, 19 JAN 90 -- SALVADORAN COLONEL GUILLERMO BENAVIDES GAVE THE ORDER TO ASSASSINATE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS WITH A PEREMPTORY SENTENCE: "EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE; IT IS EITHER US OR THEM. THESE HAVE BEEN THE INTELLECTUALS WHO HAVE BEEN GUIDING THE GUERRILLA GROUPS FOR A LONG TIME." THIS IS STATED IN A RESOLUTION ISSUED THIS MORNING BY JUDGE RICARDO ZAMORA WHO ORDERED A PROVISIONAL ARREST WHILE WAITING FOR THE TRIAL OF THE EIGHT MILITARY OFFICERS IMPLICATED IN THE CRIME AND THE ARREST OF A THIRD ONE WHO HAS BEEN AT LARGE SINCE DECEMBER. TWO LIEUTENANTS AND A SECOND LIEUTENANT HAVE ACCUSED BENAVIDES IN THEIR DEPOSITIONS AS THE PERSON WHO "GAVE THE ORDER" ON THE EVENING 15 NOVEMBER AT THE MILITARY SCHOOL HE DIRECTED AND WHICH WAS IN CHARGE OF CONTROLLING THE SECTOR WHERE THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY IS LOCATED. "WE WILL START WITH THE LEADERS. THE UNIVERSITY IS IN OUR SECTOR AND ELLACURIA IS THERE. HE MUST BE ELIMINATED AND I WANT NO WITNESSES," BENAVIDES SAID TO LIEUTENANT YUSSAY RENE MENDOZA VALLECILLOS, ACCORDING TO THE LATTER'S TESTIMONY. A FEW HOURS LATER, EARLY IN THE MORNING OF 16 NOVEMBER, JESUIT PRIESTS IGNACIO ELLACURIA, RECTOR OF THE UCA; IGNACIO MARTIN BARO, JUAN RAMON MORENO, JOAQUIN LOPEZ Y LOPEZ, SEGUNDO MONTES , AND AMANDO LOPEZ , AS WELL AS THEIR COOK, ELBA JULIA RAMOS, AND HER DAUGHTER, CELINA MARICET RAMOS, WERE ASSASSINATED. IT ALL HAPPENED DURING THE CURFEW AND 5 DAYS AFTER THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GUERRILLA GROUPS HAD LAUNCHED THEIR LARGEST OFFENSIVE. BENAVIDES GAVE THE ORDER TO LIEUTENANT MENDOZA, LIEUTENANT ESPINOZA, AND SECOND LIEUTENANT GUEVARA CERRITOS, OFFICERS OF THE ATLACATL BATTALION, AN ELITE UNIT TRAINED BY THE UNITED STATES, WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO THE MILITARY SCHOOL. THE SOLDIERS WERE TOLD THAT IT WAS NECESSARY "TO ELIMINATE THE GUERRILLA GROUPS' INTELLECTUAL LEADERS AND THAT THEY WERE AT THE UCA," ACCORDING TO CORPORAL ANGEL PEREZ VASQUEZ' DEPOSITION. THEY WERE ALSO TOLD THAT "THERE WAS INFORMATION THAT SOME INJURED TERRORIST CRIMINALS WOULD BE TAKEN TO THE UCA" AND THEY WERE INSISTENTLY TOLD THAT "ALL THE PEOPLE THERE WERE TERRORISTS." ACCORDING TO SECOND SERGEANT ANTONIO RAMIRO AVALOS VARGAS' VERSION, THE MISSION MUST BE SECRETLY CARRIED OUT BECAUSE THEY WOULD FIND SUBVERSIVE MATERIAL AND OTHER KINDS OF MATERIAL THAT COULD BE USED, SUCH AS MEDICINE, BOOTS, AND CLOTHES. ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY OFFICERS' DEPOSITIONS GATHERED IN THE JUDGE'S RESOLUTION, A FLARE WOULD BE FIRED WHEN THEY WERE ABOUT TO WITHDRAW, TO INDICATE THERE HAD BEEN A CLASH. SECOND SERGEANT ANTONIO RAMIRO AVALOS VARGAS SAYS THAT FIVE OF THE SIX JESUITS WERE TAKEN OUT TO THE GARDEN AND ORDERED TO LIE FACE DOWN, THEN LIEUTENANT ESPINOZA ORDERED HIM AND PRIVATE MARIANO AMAYA GRIMALDI TO PROCEED. THE THREE OFFICERS ADMITTED THAT THEY KNEW ABOUT THIS, BUT NOT ABOUT THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE CRIME. THE FOUR SOLDIERS ADMITTED THEIR ROLE AS EXECUTIONERS, OUT OF LOYALTY TO THEIR SUPERIORS AND BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID THEY WOULD BE CONSIDERED TRAITORS. THE JUDGE SAID THERE ARE "ENOUGH ELEMENTS" TO ESTABLISH THE PARTICIPATION OF COLONEL GUILLERMO BENAVIDES IN THESE ACTIONS, INCLUDING, FIRST OF ALL, THE DEPOSITION SIGNED BY COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF. PONCE SAID HE ORDERED THE CREATION OF A SECURITY COMMANDO, WITH HEADQUARTERS IN THE MILITARY SCHOOL AND UNDER COLONEL GUILLERMO ALFREDO BENAVIDES' COMMAND, TO DEFEND THE MILITARY INSTALLATIONS LOCATED IN THE ZONE WHICH MIGHT BECOME THE TARGETS OF "A TERRORIST AGGRESSION." THE UCA IS ALSO LOCATED IN THE ZONE. THE JUDICIAL RESOLUTION INCLUDES THE DEPOSITIONS GIVEN BY ALL THE PRISONERS TO THE POLICE, EXCEPT COL BENAVIDES, WHO MET WITH JUDGE RICARDO ZAMORA FOR OVER 2 HOURS. THE INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT BY A CRIME INVESTIGATION COMMISSION WHICH LATER SENT THE EVIDENCE AND FINDINGS TO AN ARMY HONOR COMMISSION THAT WILL COOPERATE IN DETERMING WHO IS RESPONSIBLE.
DEV-MUC3-1061	LIMA, 21 JAN 90 -- IT WAS OFFICIALLY REPORTED TODAY IN LIMA THAT PERUVIAN SECURITY FORCES KILLED 14 TERRORISTS IN CONFRONTATIONS THAT OCCURRED ON 20 JANUARY IN SEVERAL POINTS OF THE COUNTRY. AN INTERIOR MINISTRY COMMUNIQUE INDICATES THAT THE ARMED CONFRONTATIONS OCCURRED IN THE CENTRAL MOUNTAIN JUNIN DEPARTMENT AND IN PUNO DEPARTMENT, IN THE SOUTHEASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. THE DOCUMENT STATES THAT THE POLICE INTERCEPTED THE GROUP FOLLOWING A TIPOFF BY AGENTS WHO SPECIALIZE IN OBTAINING INFORMATION.

THE COMMUNIQUE ONLY DEFINES THE TERRORISTS AS "SUBVERSIVE CRIMINALS" WITHOUT INDICATING WHETHER THEY BELONG TO THE MAOIST SHINING PATH GROUP OR TO THE GUEVARIST TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT . ACCORDING TO PRESS SOURCES, DURING THE MONTH OF JANUARY THERE HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY 170 DEATHS, INCLUDING THOSE OF THE 20-JANUARY CONFRONTATIONS, DUE TO PERU'S POLITICAL VIOLENCE.

DEV-MUC3-1062	BOGOTA, 22 JAN 90 -- ATTENTION: THE MEDELLIN POLICE ARE CONFIRMING AT THIS TIME WHETHER IT IS TRUE THAT ALVARO DIEGO MONTOYA ESCOBAR, WHO IS THE SON OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY, HAS BEEN RELEASED NEAR THE CAMPOS DE PAZ CEMETARY OF THE CAPITAL OF ANTIOQUIA. AS YOU WILL RECALL, MONTOYA WAS KIDNAPPED ON 20 DECEMBER BY THE EXTRADITABLES.

DEV-MUC3-1063	MOSCOW , 23 JAN 90 -- FROM THE SOVIET POINT OF VIEW, THE QUESTION OF DELIVERIES OF WEAPONS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF EL SALVADOR TAKES ON, IN PRESENT CONDITIONS, A PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE. THIS WAS ANNOUNCED TODAY AT A BRIEFING BY GENNADIY GERASIMOV, HEAD OF THE USSR MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS INFORMATION DIRECTORATE, WHO REPORTED THE DEBATES OPENING IN THE U.S. CONGRESS ON GIVING U.S. MILITARY AID TO THAT COUNTRY. IN RECENT TIMES, THE USSR FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN NOTED, CERTAIN ADVANCES HAVE BEEN OUTLINED IN THE MATTER OF RENEWING DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE OPPOSING SIDES IN EL SALVADOR. HOWEVER, THE OPPONENTS OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATION IN THAT COUNTRY ARE TRYING TO PREVENT A CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS AND ARE COUNTING ON THE CONTINUATION OF BLOODSHED. THE EL SALVADOR PRESIDENT ALFONSO CRISTIAN CONFIRMED THE INVOLVEMENT OF TROOPS IN THE MURDER OF PRIESTS. A NEW VICTIM OF THE TERROR IS HECTOR OQUELI, EXECUTIVE SECRETARY OF THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE ON THE PROBLEMS OF THE COUNTRIES OF LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN BASIN AND ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT PARTY, SAID GENNADIY GERASIMOV. THE LEADERSHIP OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, THE SOVIET DIPLOMAT NOTED, HAS STATED ITS DECISION TO STOP CONDUCTING FURTHER COMBAT OPERATIONS IF THE UNITED STATES HALTS ITS MILITARY AID TO THE RULING REGIME. IN THESE CONDITIONS, GERASIMOV STRESSED, THE CONTINUATION OF ARMS SUPPLIES TO THE SALVADORAN ARMY IN FACT PLAYS INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO BLATANTLY VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS AND DOES NOT PROMOTE THE STRENGTHENING OF THE POSITIONS OF THOSE WHO CHAMPION DIALOGUE AND NATIONAL RECONCILIATION IN EL SALVADOR. "ALL OF THAT MAY BECOME A SERIOUS OBSTACLE IN THE WAY TOWARD A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT IN THAT COUNTRY AND CENTRAL AMERICA IN GENERAL", HE SAID.
DEV-MUC3-1064	SAN SALVADOR, 24 JAN 90 -- MILITARY AUTHORITIES HAVE REPORTED THAT THERE WAS AN ATTACK THIS MORNING AGAINST THE HOME OF RETIRED COLONEL CARLOS HUMBERTO FIGUEROA, DEPUTY INTERIOR MINISTER, BUT THAT THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES.

DEV-MUC3-1065	BOGOTA, 23 JAN 90 -- AN UNUSUAL COMMUNIQUE SIGNED BY PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA WAS DELIVERED TO EL TIEMPO NEWSPAPER DIRECTOR HERNANDO SANTOS CASTILLO. IN THIS COMMUNIQUE, ESCOBAR DENIED THAT THE MEDELLIN CARTEL IS DIVIDED AND STRESSED THAT THOSE WHO TOLD ON GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA WERE CALI CARTEL MEMBERS. FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, ESCOBAR'S GROUP HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN A FIGHT TO THE DEATH WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE CALI CARTEL. ESCOBAR'S COMMUNIQUE EVEN GIVES THE NAME OF THE PERSON WHO COLLECTED THE REWARD FROM THE AUTHORITIES, A REWARD THAT HAD BEEN ANNOUNCED ON TELEVISION AS A PRIZE FOR DENOUNCING EL MEJICANO . HERE IS MORE ON THIS COMMUNIQUE: IN A NEW EXCHANGE OF COMMUNIQUES, A PRACTICE THAT HAS BECOME COMMON NOWADAYS, ESCOBAR DECIDED TO WRITE A LETTER TO SANTOS TO CLARIFY CERTAIN DOUBTS: FIRST, TO SAY THAT HIS FRIENDS AND COLLABORATORS HAVE NOT WITHDRAWN THEIR SUPPORT AS A RESULT OF A CAMPAIGN CARRIED OUT BY THE 4TH BRIDAGE IN ANTIOQUIA, AS REPORTED IN EL TIEMPO. ESCOBAR STRESSED THAT THE BEST PROOF THAT HIS FRIENDS HAVE NOT BETRAYED OR ABANDONED HIM IS THAT HE IS STILL FREE. SECOND, HE SAID THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT EVER DECIDES TO FIGHT FOR PEACE, IT WILL FIND A LONG, ENDLESS LIST OF EXTRADITABLES, DRUG TRAFFICKERS, HENCHMEN, AND PARAMILITARY GROUP MEMBERS WHO WANT TO ACCOMPANY THE GOVERNMENT IN THAT PROCESS. THIRD, HE ACCUSED JORGE VELAZQUEZ, A MEMBER OF THE CALI CARTEL WHOSE ALIAS IS "THE NAVIGATOR," OF DENOUNCING RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND COLLECTING THE REWARD. HE ALSO ACCUSED CALI CARTEL MEMBERS OF DENOUNCING JORGE LUIS OCHOA IN PALMIRA AND OF BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DISAPPEARANCE AND MURDER OF ANTIOQUIA PEOPLE WHO VISITED VALLE DEL CAUCA DEPARTMENT. ESCOBAR ALSO CHARGED THAT CALI CARTEL MEMBERS PLACED 700 KG OF DYNAMITE IN HIS FAMILY'S BUILDING. FOURTH, HE NOTED THAT HIS STRUGGLE IS AGAINST THE CALI CARTEL NOT THE VALLE DEL CAUCA PEOPLE AND ADDED: I FEEL GREAT ADMIRATION AND PROFOUND RESPECT FOR VALLE PEOPLE BECAUSE MY WIFE, VICTORIA, WAS BORN IN THAT BEAUTIFUL LAND, HER ANCESTORS ALL LIVED THERE. CONCLUDING HE SAID THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS NEVER ACCEPTED THE CALI CARTEL'S PEACE PROPOSAL, HE HAS NEVER REJECTED DIALOGUE AS AN ALTERNATIVE FOR SOLUTIONS.
DEV-MUC3-1066	SAN SALVADOR, 24 JAN 90 -- COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF, TODAY DISCLOSED AN ALLEGED PLAN ACCORDING TO WHICH THE GUERRILLAS WILL ATTEMPT TO ATTACK MILITARY POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR "TO PRESSURE THE GOVERNMENT INTO NEGOTIATING A POLITICAL SOLUTION" TO THE ARMED CONFLICT. CITING MILITARY INTELLIGENCE REPORTS, PONCE ANTICIPATED THAT "AS OF NEXT WEEKEND, UNTIL 10 FEBRUARY, THE GUERRILLAS WILL CARRY OUT TERRORIST ACTIONS AND ATTACKS ON MILITARY UNITS, PRIMARILY IN THE METROPOLITAN AREA, IN ORDER TO INFLUENCE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN A PROPAGANDISTIC MANNER." "THEY ARE TRYING TO INFLUENCE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SO THAT IT, IN TURN, WILL MOVE TOWARD NEGOTIATING A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE ARMED CONFLICT," PONCE SAID DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE GENERAL STAFF'S HEADQUARTERS. THE EXECUTION OF THE ALLEGED FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT PLAN WILL COINCIDE WITH SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S SCHEDULED TRIP TO THE UNITED NATIONS AT THE END OF THE MONTH. CRISTIANI WILL MEET ON 31 JANUARY WITH UN SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR, TO REQUEST HIS GOOD OFFICES IN FAVOR OF RESUMING THE DIALOGUE WITH THE GUERRILLAS, WHICH WAS SUSPENDED IN OCTOBER. FOLLOWING NOVEMBER'S GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE, THE GOVERNMENT AND FMLN HAVE EXPRESSED A WILLINGNESS TO RESUME THE DIALOGUE, WITH UNITED NATIONS PARTICIPATION. PONCE POINTED OUT THAT THE "SPECIFIC AREAS" THE GUERRILLAS WILL ATTEMPT TO ATTACK ARE SOME OF THE MILITARY POSITIONS AT THE EL ESPINO FARM IN THE NORTHWESTERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR, AYUTUXTEPEQUE IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY, ZARAGOZA AND HUIZUCAR IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR, AND SOYAPANGO IN THE EAST. THESE AREAS ARE AMONG THE LEADING SITES OF THE BLOODIEST CLASHES BETWEEN SOLDIERS AND GUERRILLAS DURING THE REBELS' HARSHEST OFFENSIVE 11 NOVEMBER. THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND REBELS WAS SUSPENDED IN OCTOBER FOLLOWING A DYNAMITE ATTACK AGAINST A LABOR UNION HEADQUARTERS IN WHICH 10 WORKERS WERE KILLED AND 30 OTHERS WOUNDED. PRIOR TO THE SUSPENSION OF THE DIALOGUE, THE GOVERNMENT AND FMLN HELD TWO ROUNDS OF TALKS IN MEXICO AND COSTA RICA, BUT FAILED TO REACH AGREEMENTS THAT WOULD HAVE ENDED THE COUNTRY'S ARMED CONFLICT.
DEV-MUC3-1067	BOGOTA, 17 JAN 90 -- ACCORDING TO ESTIMATES BY THE U.S. DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY , THE VOLUME OF BUSINESS GENERATED BY THE COCAINE CULTIVATED AND PRODUCED BY PERUVIAN, BOLIVIAN, AND COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS WHEN IT IS PEDDLED ON THE STREETS OF THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE IS $140 BILLION ANNUALLY. ACCORDING TO THE EXPERTS, COCAINE TRAFFICKING IN COLOMBIA MAY TOTAL $100 MILLION IF RETAIL SALES IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. THIS ILLEGAL TRADE, WHICH AMOUNTS TO 10 PERCENT OF THE WORLD ARMS TRADE VOLUME, MAY COME TO AN END IF THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT ACCEPTS THE PEACE OFFER FROM "THE EXTRADITABLES," ARMED WING OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL. OF THE $140 MILLION, THE TAKE OF THE COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS ON A WHOLESALE BASIS IS ONLY $7.13 BILLION ANNUALLY, ACCORDING TO A STUDY MADE BY CARLOS CABALLERO ARGAEZ, PRESIDENT OF THE COLOMBIAN BANKING ASSOCIATION. ACCORDING TO CABALLERO, WHEN THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS, INPUT, TRANSPORTATION, SECURITY, AND CONFISCATIONS IS DEDUCTED, THE NET ANNUAL EARNINGS OF THE COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS TOTAL $4.060 BILLION. CABALLERO ASSERTS THAT THE COLOMBIAN TRAFFICKERS EXPORT A TOTAL OF 310 TONS PER YEAR, OF WHICH 270 TONS ARE SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES AT AN AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICE OF $19,000 PER KILOGRAM, AND 40 TONS IN EUROPE AT $50,000 PER KILOGRAM. THE EXPERT TOLD EFE THAT THE NETWORKS OF PEDDLERS SELL THE COCAINE AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $200,000 PER KILOGRAM, AND THEREFORE THEIR GROSS TAKE MAY BE $62 BILLION PER YEAR. IF THE EXTRA PROFITS RESULTING FROM DILUTING THE POWDER BY MIXING IT WITH OTHER SUBSTANCES IS ADDED TO THIS AMOUNT, THEIR GROSS EARNINGS MAY AMOUNT TO $100 BILLION PER YEAR. THE DEA'S ESTIMATE OF $140 BILLION IS REACHED BY ADDING TO THE $100 BILLION THAT THE COLOMBIAN COCAINE FINALLY GENERATES ABOUT $40 BILLION GENERATED BY PERUVIAN AND COLOMBIAN NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS. CABALLERO ASSERTS THAT COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS INVEST APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION OF THE NET EARNINGS OF $4.060 BILLION IN COLOMBIA. ACCORDING TO THE COLOMBIAN FEDERATION OF REAL ESTATE MARKETS AND UN CONSULTANTS, THIS MONEY HAS BEEN INVESTED IN 1 MILLION HECTARES OF FARMLAND AND RANGES, BUILDINGS, INDUSTRIES, AND TOURISM BUSINESSES. THE $1 BILLION THE COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE INVESTED ANNUALLY IN COLOMBIA DURING THE 1980'S REPRESENTS 2.8 PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY'S $35 BILLION GNP. ACCORDING TO THE DEA, THE 270 TONS OF COCAINE THAT ARRIVE IN THE UNITED STATES FROM COLOMBIA REPRESENT 80 PERCENT OF THE COCAINE CONSUMED IN THAT COUNTRY. DEA SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT THE CALI CARTEL, THE OTHER COLOMBIAN MAFIA ORGANIZATION AND SECOND LARGEST AFTER THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, CONTROLS THE WHOLESALE MARKET IN NEW YORK AND PART OF THAT IN LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO. THE STRUGGLE FOR THOSE MARKETS RESULTED LAST YEAR IN WHAT THE POLICE DUBBED THE "WAR AMONG THE CARTELS," AND IN THE KILLING OF 100 MEMBERS FROM BOTH ORGANIZATIONS. ACCORDING TO STATISTICS FROM THE COLOMBIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, 3,000 PERSONS DIE FROM DRUG ABUSE IN THE UNITED STATES EVERY YEAR, WHILE ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO CAUSE 520,000 DEATHS PER YEAR THERE.
DEV-MUC3-1068	BOGOTA, 25 JAN 90 -- COLOMBIAN AND VENEZUELAN AUTHORITIES ARE FACED WITH A SERIOUS ECOLOGICAL EMERGENCY TONIGHT FOLLOWING THE EXPLOSION OF A POWERFUL BOMB PLACED BY GUERRILLAS AT THE MAIN OIL PIPELINE IN COLOMBIA, CAUSING MORE THAN 15,000 BARRELS OF OIL TO SPILL AND REACH THE CATATUMBO RIVER ALONG THE BORDER BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. REPORTS IN BOGOTA POINT OUT THAT THE OIL SPILL, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 3 KM LONG, IS SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD THE CATATUMBO RIVER, THREATENING TO REACH VENEZUELA'S MARACAIBO LAKE WITHIN HOURS. THE DYNAMITE ATTACK WAS PERPETRATED, ACCORDING TO COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES, BY THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION , WHICH IS CONSIDERED THE MOST RADICAL REBEL GROUP OF THE MANY OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY. ACCORDING TO REPORTS, MEMBERS OF THAT INSURGENT ORGANIZATION COMPLETELY BLEW UP A STRETCH OF THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS OIL PIPELINE, IN AN AREA CLOSE TO TEORAMA IN NORTE DE SANTANDER DEPARTMENT. SINCE LAST YEAR THE ELN, WHICH IS HEADED BY SEVERAL FORMER SPANISH PRIESTS, HAS PERPETRATED OVER 30 ATTACKS AGAINST COLOMBIAN OIL INSTALLATIONS TO PROTEST THE JOINT EXPLOITATION OF CRUDE BY THE GOVERNMENT AND MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES.
DEV-MUC3-1069	TEGUCIGALPA, NO DATE -- MILTON MATEO OF HRN, COMMANDER BORGE. IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM EL SALVADOR, YOU SAID THAT YOU HOPED FOR AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN REBELS AND THE SALVADORAN ARMY AND GOVERNMENT. YOU, LIKE ALL CENTRAL AMERICANS, WANT PEACE, BUT DO YOU NOT THINK THAT THIS RUNS CONTRARY TO THE FACT THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS PRESENTED RELIABLE PROOF OF MILITARY AID TO THE LEFTIST SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS, AND RECENTLY, AN ARMED FORCES PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICER SAID THAT NICARAGUA IS A SANCTUARY FOR A SUBVERSIVE GROUP KNOWN AS THE CINCHONEROS OF HONDURAS? AS FOR THE STATEMENT THAT NICARAGUA IS A SANCTUARY FOR A HONDURAN GUERRILLA GROUP, I WISH TO SAY THAT THE STATEMENT IS NOT ONLY FALSE, BUT A SERIOUS CHARGE. I INVITE ANYONE WHO WANTS TO COME TO NICARAGUA, INCLUDING THE HONDURAN AUTHORITIES, TO DO SO. WE WILL GIVE THEM ABSOLUTE FREEDOM TO SHOW WHERE THE CINCHONEROS CAMPS ARE LOCATED, WHERE THEIR HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED OR THEIR ACTIVITIES ARE BEING CARRIED OUT. IF THIS EXISTS, IT CANNOT BE HIDDEN. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO HIDE A MILITARY TRAINING CAMP. I ASSURE THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE VERY SERIOUSLY AND WITH A HIGH SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY, THAT NICARAGUA WILL NOT PROVIDE ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR GUERRILLA GROUPS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES TO ESTABLISH CAMPS IN NICARAGUA, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CONCERNS HONDURAS. WHAT ABOUT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS? MANY THINGS HAVE BEEN SAID ABOUT EL SALVADOR. IT IS SAID THAT WE SUPPLY WEAPONS TO THE SALVADORAN REVOLUTIONARIES. THIS CHARGE HAS BEEN MADE FOR MANY YEARS. I COULD SAY THAT THE AIRPLANE THAT WE DOWNED IN NICARAGUA, FLOWN BY THE FAMOUS HASENFUS, CAME FROM EL SALVADOR, BUT WHY BRING THAT UP? THE FACT IS THAT THERE EXISTS IN THE WORLD A POWERFUL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, KNOWN AS THE CIA, WHICH HAS ENORMOUS TECHNICAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES THAT CAN ENABLE IT TO ACCURATELY DETERMINE WHAT IS HAPPENING ANYWHERE, AND YET IT HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT NICARAGUA IS PROVIDING WEAPONS TO ANY ARMED MOVEMENT ANYWHERE. THEREFORE, LET US PUT THAT INTO THE SAME CONTEXT AS THE STATEMENT THAT OUR RELATIONS WITH CUBA ARE COOLING. WE COULD ALSO POINT OUT OTHER LIES TOLD ABOUT US. WE HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF ALL KINDS OF THINGS. WE HAVE BEEN CALLED DRUG TRAFFICKERS. WE ARE ACCUSED OF BURNING DOWN A JEWISH SYNAGOGUE IN NICARAGUA. INCIDENTALLY, LET ME TELL YOU THAT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A JEWISH SYNAGOGUE IN NICARAGUA, YET THIS WAS SAID BY NO LESS THAN U.S. PRESIDENT REAGAN. THUS, THEY TELL ALL THOSE LIES ABOUT NICARAGUA AND THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY SAY, JUST AS THEY SAY THAT WE ARE THE ENEMIES OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THAT WE PERSECUTE CLERGYMEN. NOTE THAT IN NICARAGUA NO PRIEST HAS EVER BEEN IMPRISONED, MURDERED, OR EXILED, EXCEPT ON ONE OCCASION BECAUSE OF VERY SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. IN NICARAGUA, WE HAVE MADE CONSCIENTIOUS EFFORTS TO RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, BUT THE MAIN ACCUSATION LEVELED AGAINST OUR COUNTRY IS FAILURE TO RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS. WE ARE ACCUSED OF PLANNING ELECTORAL FRAUD. THERE WAS A POLL DONE BY A U.S. FIRM THAT GIVES THE SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT ... I WISH TO POINT OUT THAT IT IS NOT A SANDINIST COMPANY; IT MIGHT HAVE VERY LITTLE SYMPATHY FOR SANDINISM, BUT IT IS APPARENTLY A RELIABLE COMPANY. IT GIVES THE FSLN A MAJORITY OF 51 PERCENT, AND THE NATIONAL OPPOSITION UNION -- ONE OF THE POLITICAL FORCES PARTICIPATING IN THE ELECTORAL CONTEST -- 24 PERCENT. OTHER POLLS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN HAVE GIVEN THE FSLN CLOSE TO 69 PERCENT, AS OPPOSED TO UNO, TO WHICH THEY ATTRIBUTED 27 PERCENT. YET, WHAT IS BEING SAID? THAT THERE WILL BE ELECTORAL FRAUD. THEREFORE, THAT CHARGE AND OTHERS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE, LIKE THIS ONE WHICH GREATLY BOTHERS ME, TO THE EFFECT THAT WE ARE HARBORING SUBVERSIVE GROUPS FOR THEM TO COME TO HONDURAS... I CAN GUARANTEE TO THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES AND TO THE NEW HONDURAN GOVERNMENT THAT IN NICARAGUA WE WILL NOT TAKE A SINGLE STEP IN THAT DIRECTION. ON PANAMA, I DO NOT NEED TO SAY ANYTHING. THE FACTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES.
DEV-MUC3-1070	SAN SALVADOR, 15 JAN 90 -- SALVADORAN VICE PRESIDENT FRANCISCO MERINO LOPEZ HAS SAID THAT "THE FMLN DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO REPEAT A TERRORIST ATTACK LIKE THE ONE LAUNCHED ON 11 NOVEMBER BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE THE LOGISTICAL OR OTHER NECESSARY SUPPORT AT THIS TIME, NOR WILL IT HAVE SUCH SUPPORT IN THE MONTHS TO COME." MERINO SAID THAT THE FMLN REPEATS ITS TERRORIST ACTIVITIES IN CYCLES THAT MUST BE BROKEN TO PREVENT FURTHER SUFFERING AND BLOODSHED. THE VICE PRESIDENT SAID THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS HAVE LOST GROUND IN EVERY WAY AND THE DIALOGUE MUST BE RESUMED AS THE ONLY WAY TO ACHIEVE A FIRM AND LASTING PEACE IN THE COUNTRY. "THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS NEVER BEEN NAIVE REGARDING THE FMLN'S LACK OF SINCERITY DURING THE DIALOGUE, BUT IT IS OUR DUTY TO SEEK PEACE THROUGH REASON, EVEN THOUGH WE ARE AWARE OF THE FMLN'S WARLIKE ATTITUDE," MERINO SAID. REGARDING THE FMLN'S DESIRE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEETING TO BE HELD BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC WITH THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS IN NEW YORK, MERINO SAID THE GUERRILLAS CANNOT HOPE TO BE ON AN EQUAL FOOTING WITH THE PRESIDENT OF EL SALVADOR. "THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO NEW YORK TO EXPRESS, ONCE AGAIN, THE SINCERITY WITH WHICH THE GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO ACHIEVE PEACE THROUGH DIALOGUE. THE FMLN'S HOPE OF HAVING A TETE-A-TETE WITH THE PRESIDENT AT THE UNITED NATIONS IS TOTALLY ABSURD," THE VICE PRESIDENT SAID. MERINO SAID THAT THE GUERRILLA'S ONLY WAY OUT IS TO GIVE UP THE ARMED STRUGGLE AND JOIN IN THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC LIFE, ALTHOUGH HE CONCEDED THAT THE PROCESS WILL BE DIFFICULT AND THAT IT WILL NATURALLY HAVE TO BE GRADUAL IN ORDER FOR THE GUERRILLA FIGHTERS TO FEEL SAFE "WITHOUT HAVING A WEAPON AT THE READY." ON THE OTHER HAND, IN REFERENCE TO THE CASE OF THE JESUITS, IN WHICH MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED, MERINO ADVISED CAUTION REGARDING STATEMENTS THAT VARIOUS GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY MIGHT MAKE. "PRUDENCE IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO GET TO THE TRUTH," MERINO SAID. HE POINTED OUT THAT THE ADVANCES MADE IN INVESTIGATIONS OF THE CASE PROVE THE DEGREE OF DEMOCRACY THAT PREVAILS IN THE COUNTRY.
DEV-MUC3-1071	CLANDESTINE, 28 JAN 90 -- ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON, LIFETIME PRESIDENT OF ARENA , HAS SAID THAT THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER ARRESTS OR DETENTIONS OF SOLDIERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE JESUIT MURDER CASE. THE GOVERNMENT'S STRONGMAN HAS SAID IT IS OVER, PERIOD. D'AUBUISSON INSISTS THAT THERE ARE NO OTHER MILITARY MEN INVOLVED IN THE JESUIT CASE, ACCORDING TO A HEADLINE IN TODAY'S LA PRENSA GRAFICA, IN WHICH IT PUBLISHES D'AUBUISSON'S STATEMENTS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE WILL SUMMON D'AUBUISSON TO PRESENT THE EVIDENCE THAT HAS LED HIM TO ASSERT CATEGORICALLY THAT NO OTHER SENIOR OFFICERS WERE INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF THE PRIESTS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE SO, BECAUSE THAT PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED TO SUMMON OR TO INQUIRE, NOT EVEN TO SUMMON THE MAIN SUSPECT IN THE MURDERS, WHICH HAVE BEEN BLAMED ON THE DEATH SQUADS. ONE OF THEM IS FORMER PRESIDENT JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, WHO ACCUSED HIM OF BEING THE MASTERMIND OF MSGR ROMERO'S ASSASSINATION. YET, D'AUBUISSON GOES ON COMPLETELY UNSCATHED. THEREFORE, ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON TODAY PLACED A FINAL PERIOD ON THE INVESTIGATION OF COLONEL BENAVIDES. OBVIOUSLY, MAJOR D'AUBUISSON, THE ARENA STRONGMAN, IS PLACING A FINAL PERIOD ON THE CASE, AND HE IS TELLING THIS DIRECTLY AND PUBLICLY TO CRISTIANI, THE YANKEES, AND THE REST OF LA TANDONA . IT IS IMPERATIVE FOR ARENA MEMBERS TO TELL CRISTIANI HOW FAR TO GO WITH THE INVESTIGATION. THEY NEVER APPROVED OF HAVING EVEN THE LIEUTENANTS OF THE ATLACATL BATTALION INVESTIGATED. THE HEATED ARGUMENTS WITHIN THE ARENA LEADERSHIP HAVE DESTABILIZED THE GOVERNMENT TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT MERINO'S SUDDEN FALL IS BUT THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG AND D'AUBUISSON'S SIGNAL TO STOP A SHOW OF FORCE. D'AUBUISSON BELIEVES THAT SERVING UP BENAVIDES' HEAD IS MORE THAN ENOUGH, AND THIS IS THE FRANK MESSAGE THAT ARENA AND THE GOVERNMENT ARE SENDING TO THE U.S. CONGRESS, PRECISELY AT THE TIME THE YANKEE POLICY ON EL SALVADOR IS UNDER SERIOUS SCRUTINY. THE STRONGMAN IS TELLING LA TANDONA: DO NOT WORRY ANY MORE. WE HAD TO GIVE SOMETHING TO THE CONGRESS, BUT CRISTIANI'S MODERATION WILL GO JUST SO FAR. D'AUBUISSON CONTINUES TO BE THE STRONGMAN.
DEV-MUC3-1072	SAN SALVADOR, 29 JAN 90 -- TODAY, 2 DAYS BEFORE HIS MEETING WITH UN SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR, PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI REAFFIRMED HIS WILLINGNESS TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT . HOWEVER, CRISTIANI SAID, THE FLMN IS SENDING CONTRADICTORY SIGNALS ON ITS COMMITMENT TO PEACE. A FEW HOURS BEFORE DEPARTING ON HIS TRIP TO WASHINGTON TODAY, THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC REITERATED HIS WILLINGNESS TO RESUME A DIALOGUE WITH THE FMLN, WHICH, HE SAID, IS ONE OF THE REASONS FOR HIS VISIT TO THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL. THE MAIN GOAL IS TO HOLD A WORK SESSION WITH THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL. THIS WILL BE ON 31 JANUARY. THE GOAL IS TO SEARCH FOR AND COME UP WITH ANY MECHANISMS THAT COULD EASE THE RESUMPTION OF THE DIALOGUE PROCESS, SO ALL VIOLENT ACTIONS CEASE AND SO WE CAN SEARCH FOR AN AGREEMENT FOR THE REINCORPORATION OF THE FMLN THROUGH POLITICAL MEANS. THEN WE WILL HOLD A MEETING WITH PRESIDENT BUSH ON 1 FEBRUARY IN WASHINGTON. WE WILL ALSO VISIT OTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT, WHO JUST RETURNED FROM HONDURAS WHERE HE MET U.S. VICE PRESIDENT DAN QUAYLE AND OTHER LATIN AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, TOLD NEWSMEN TODAY THAT HE HAS RECEIVED OFFERS FROM THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE IN VENEZUELA. WE ARE DETERMINED TO SEARCH FOR A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT THROUGH DIALOGUE. THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT WE WILL DISCUSS WITH UN SECRETARY GENERAL PEREZ DE CUELLAR -- SEARCHING FOR ELEMENTS THAT WOULD MAKE THIS POSSIBLE. REGARDING THE FMLN, WE SEE SOME CONTRADICTORY INDICATIONS AT THIS TIME. IN SOME COMMUNIQUES, THE FMLN IS SOMEHOW EXPRESSING THE DESIRE TO RETURN TO THE DIALOGUE PROCESS, BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE ARE REPORTS THAT THE FMLN CONTINUES TRYING TO PLAN SOME ATTACKS ON SAN SALVADOR, IN ADDITION TO OTHER TERRORIST ACTIONS AIMED AT THE ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE. WE BELIEVE THIS IS CONTRADICTORY. HOWEVER, I MYSELF BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME POSITIVE ELEMENTS THAT WILL PERMIT RESUMING A DIALOGUE PROCESS THAT COULD BRING SOME BENEFITS. ASKED ABOUT REPORTS BY THE SAN SALVADOR AUXILIARY BISHOP REGARDING SEARCHES AT SOME CATHOLIC CHURCH OFFICES, CRISTIANI SAID THIS SHOULD NOT BE SOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT, BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN FOR SECURITY REASONS. AS PART OF THE THINGS TAKING PLACE IN THE COUNTRY AT THIS TIME, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME REPORTS HAVE BEEN TOTALLY WRONG. HOWEVER, I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS SHOULD BE TAKEN AT ALL AS A SIGN OF SOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT. THESE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN FOR SECURITY REASONS, BASED ON REPORTS WE HAVE RECEIVED. THEREFORE, WE MUST TAKE ACTION, AND IF THERE IS NOTHING.... THOSE WHO HAVE NO PROBLEM AND HAVE NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN ILLEGAL MATTERS SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR. THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT SAID HE IS PLEASED WITH THE STATEMENTS BY NEW HONDURAN PRESIDENT RAFAEL CALLEJAS, WHO EXPRESSED HIS TOTAL SUPPORT FOR THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PLAN. CONCERNING AN UPCOMING CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMIT, THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT NO DATE HAS BEEN SET YET AND HE BELIEVES THIS CANNOT BE DONE BEFORE THE NICARAGUAN ELECTIONS.
DEV-MUC3-1073	SAN SALVADOR, 29 JAN 90 -- COLONEL MAURICIO ERNESTO VARGAS TODAY HAS SAID THERE IS NO NEED OR REASON FOR THE UNITED STATES TO SUSPEND AID TO THE COUNTRY. HOWEVER, SHOULD WE GET TO THAT POINT, THE ARMED FORCES ARE READY TO CONTINUE DEFENDING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. COL VARGAS BELIEVES THE U.S. AID IS NOT ONLY A MATTER OF MILITARY ASSISTANCE PROVIDED TO THE SALVADORAN ARMY, BUT ALSO A MATTER OF DEFENDING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THE COUNTRY. THE MILITARY OFFICER SAID IT IS NOT POSSIBLE THAT A MINORITY, AS HE TERMED THE FMLN WILL AFFECT, WITH ITS DISINFORMATION METHODS AIMED AT COUNTRIES ABROAD, U.S. MILITARY AID BEING CUT OFF OR DECREASED. HOWEVER, IN ANY CASE, COL VARGAS SAID THAT IF THE AID IS SUSPENDED, THIS WOULD COMPLICATE THE ARMED FORCES PLANS CONCERNING THE COUNTERINSURGENCY STRUGGLE. I CERTAINLY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE, HAVING A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, HAVE SO LITTLE CAPACITY TO DEFEND THE TRUTH. IT CAN TAKE 100 DAYS TO SPREAD A LIE, BUT YOU CAN TELL THE TRUTH IN 1 DAY. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IN THIS CONTEXT.... I BELIEVE WE ARE OVERESTIMATING THE LEFT-WING ACTIONS. WE VIEW THEM AS BEING SMART, AND WE SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLS. ANY CUT OR SUSPENSION IN THE AID WILL CAUSE PROBLEMS BECAUSE IT WILL CREATE FURTHER NEEDS WHENEVER WE NEED TO FULFILL A MISSION. THEREFORE, MISSIONS WILL BE A BIT MORE COMPLICATED, BUT WE WILL FULFILL THEM. IF MARXISTS -- THROUGH THEIR CONCEPT OF DISINFORMATION -- BELIEVE THEY CAN ATTEMPT TO HARM THE UNITED STATES-EL SALVADOR ALLIANCE THROUGH THIS PROCESS, AND THAT THIS WILL LEAD THEM TO POWER, THEY ARE COMPLETELY WRONG. THEY WILL FIND AN ARMED FORCES WHICH WILL ALWAYS BE FIRMLY DETERMINED TO DEFEND THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. COL VARGAS, IN CHARGE OF THE 3D MILITARY ZONE IN SAN MIGUEL, SAID HE AGREES WITH THE DECISION TO PROSECUTE THE EIGHT MILITARY MEN, INCLUDING ONE COLONEL AND TWO LIEUTENANTS, CHARGED WITH KILLING SIX JESUIT PRIESTS. COL VARGAS SAID THOSE WHO HAVE BROKEN THE LAW MUST PAY FOR IT, NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE. THE ARMY WILL FEEL PAIN IN THE EVENT ANY OF ITS MEMBERS ARE INVOLVED IN ACTIONS WHICH VIOLATE THE PRINCIPLES THAT RULE THE ARMED FORCES. THIS IS VERY PAINFUL. HOWEVER, IF WE ARE BUILDING A DEMOCRACY, THERE ARE FACTS THAT MUST BE JUDGED ACCORDING TO THE NORMS PREVAILING IN A DEMOCRACY. DEMOCRACY MUST PREVAIL OVER PEOPLE. DEMOCRACY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN INDIVIDUALS AND THAN INSTITUTIONS IN INDIVIDUAL TERMS, AND MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE INDIVIDUAL INTEREST OF PEOPLE OR GROUPS, WHICH CANNOT PREVAIL OVER THE NATIONAL INTEREST. IN THE MILITARY ASPECT, COL VARGAS SAID THAT AS OF 1990, IN HIS AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY, THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING THE PLANS DRAFTED BY THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF KNOWN AS "VICTORY AND HAMMER" WHICH HAS OFFERED, AS PRELIMINARY RESULTS, 53 CLASHES, 37 GUERRILLAS AND 12 SOLDIERS KILLED, AND WEAPONS SEIZURES. THE TWO OPERATIONS, HE ADDED, HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL.
DEV-MUC3-1074	SAN SALVADOR, 25 JAN 90 -- ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON THE POLICE IN WASHINGTON ARRESTED THE LEADERS OF A GROUP OF DEMONSTRATORS WHO HAD GATHERED IN FRONT OF THE CAPITOL TO DEMAND THE SUSPENSION OF MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR. A FEW HOURS LATER, REPRESENTATIVES OF SEVERAL CHURCHES ASSERTED THAT A PERSECUTION HAD BEEN LAUNCHED IN OUR COUNTRY AGAINST "RELIGIOUS PEOPLE" AND THAT THE AID SHOULD BE SUSPENDED FOR THAT REASON. THE FOREGONE CONCLUSION WAS THAT, BECAUSE OF THE SUSPENSION OF THE AID, OUR GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE NO OTHER OPTION BUT TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE TERRORISTS. THIS CAMPAIGN DATES BACK A LONG TIME. IT BEGAN WITH THE ARRIVAL IN EL SALVADOR OF SEVERAL JESUIT PRIESTS FROM LOVAINA UNIVERSITY IN THE EARLY 1960'S AND CONTINUED WITH THE FOUNDING OF UCA , THE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF CERTAIN PRIESTS IN THE SUBVERSIVE MOVEMENTS, THE AGITATION LAUNCHED BY THE ALAS PRIESTS, THE TRAGIC EPISODE INVOLVING MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO, AND THE USE OF THAT EPISODE BY THE LEFT. EL SALVADOR WAS, AND TO SOME EXTENT CONTINUES TO BE, THE SCENARIO IN WHICH THE "THEOLOGY OF LIBERATION" REACHED ITS ULTIMATE CONSEQUENCES BY PLACING THE INQUISITORIAL FANATICISM OF CERTAIN PRIESTS AND PASTORS SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE MOST RADICAL CURRENTS OF SOCIALISM. THE VIRULENCE OF THE ONSLAUGHT WENT THAT FAR PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE PASSIVE ATTITUDE -- OR, RATHER, THE CONNIVING PERMISSIVENESS -- OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC REGIME, WHICH TRIED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE STRIDENT CAMPAIGN TO FURTHER ITS OWN POLITICAL ENDS. DUARTE NEVER TRULY DISTANCED HIMSELF FAR FROM THE GUERRILLAS BECAUSE OF HIS ILL-DISGUISED IDEOLOGICAL LEANINGS, WHICH LED HIM TO COINCIDE IN GREAT PART WITH THE SUBVERSIVES' TENETS AND ABOVE ALL WITH THE FANCIFUL IDEA THAT THE PEOPLE APPROVED OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMUNIST STATE IN EL SALVADOR. IT IS CERTAINLY DIFFICULT TO COUNTER ORGANIZED SLANDER, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION HOW FAR CERTAIN NOTIONS HAVE GONE AND HOW MUCH SUPPORT THEY RECEIVE FROM THE NEWS MEDIA IN A LARGE PART OF THE WORLD. THE POSSIBILITIES OF SUCCESSFULLY COUNTERING THIS PROPAGANDA OFFENSIVE MAY NOT BE THE BEST, BUT IT WOULD BE WORSE TO REMAIN SILENT AND DO NOTHING. WE HAVE YET TO SEE THE ORGANIZATION OF A TRUE EFFORT TO REJECT THE PERMANENT DEFAMATION BEING WITHSTOOD BY THE COUNTRY. THERE IS NO ANSWER TO THE ACCUSATIONS AND INSULTS ISSUED BY CERTAIN SECTORS, EITHER. TO ALLOW A PERSON WHO ACTS AS LEADER OF THE TERRORISTS' POLITICAL FRONT TO COME TO THE COUNTRY AND SCOLD PRESIDENT CRISTIANI WITHOUT HAVING THE AUTHORITIES ARREST HIM FOR HIS PARTICIPATION IN CRIMES PERPETRATED AGAINST THE REPUBLIC IS TO FALL INTO DANGEROUS EXTREMES OF TOLERANCE. WAS NOT JENNIFER CASOLO ALLOWED TO OPENLY REPRESENT THE SUBVERSIVES FOR MANY YEARS WITHOUT INVESTIGATING HER MORE CLOSELY? IS IT PERHAPS THAT THE LAWS ALLOW A FOREIGNER TO MEDDLE IN THE COUNTRY'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS? HOW CAN JUDGES BE BANNED FROM CERTAIN INSTALLATIONS, SUCH AS THE THE BOMBED FENASTRAS HEADQUARTERS, UNIVERSITIES, AND SIMILAR PLACES, WHEN THERE ARE SUFFICIENT GROUNDS TO SUSPECT THAT TERRORISTS ARE HIDDEN IN SUCH PLACES?
DEV-MUC3-1075	BOGOTA, 26 JAN 90 -- IN A REPORT FOR TELEVISION YESTERDAY YOU POINTED OUT THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF THE GUERRILLAS IN COLOMBIA. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT KIDNAPPINGS? WE ARE LIVING IN A TIME WHERE ALL HAVE TO BECOME UP TO DATE, BUT BEING UP TO DATE DOES NOT MEAN WE HAVE TO BECOME DARKER. QUITE THE CONTRARY, IT MEANS SHEDDING MORE LIGHT ON LIFE. WE ARE BENT ON THIS. OF COURSE, THIS ALSO MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO ABANDON PRACTICES LIKE KIDNAPPING. SURELY YOU KNOW VERY WELL WHO YOUR NEMESIS WAS 24 HOURS AGO. WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST REGARDING MILITARY TRAINING AND ORIENTATION IN COLOMBIA? ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN ORGANIZED FOR CENTURIES TO WIN WARS. IN COLOMBIA WE HAVE TO ORGANIZE THE MILITARY TO ACHIEVE PEACE, PARTICULARLY PEACE AT HOME. THE MILITARY HAS A GREAT CONTRIBUTION TO MAKE AND THERE ARE VALUABLE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN IT. THE DEMOCRATIC LINEAGE DOES NOT EXHAUST ITSELF IN GUERRILLAS, AND THERE IS ALSO A GREAT DEMOCRATIC QUALITY IN THE ARMED FORCES. WHAT DO YOU FEEL AFTER KILLING SO MANY POLICEMEN? WE WILL HAVE TO ASK THE POLICE WHAT THEY THINK AFTER KILLING SO MANY GUERRILLAS. WE HAVE LIVED IN VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY. QUESTIONS DEALING WITH VIOLENCE AND WAR SHOULD BE AVOIDED. WHAT DID YOU FEEL WHEN YOU PASSED IN FRONT OF THE PALACE OF JUSTICE YESTERDAY? I DID NOT DO THAT. I AM STILL LOOKING FORWARD TO WALKING PAST THE PALACE OF JUSTICE. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU WILL FEEL AFTER WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PALACE? WELL, THAT THIS IS SOMETHING TO PONDER. ACCORDING TO WHAT THE PEOPLE HAVE EXPRESSED TO ME, SOME COLOMBIAN SECTORS FIND IT DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT YOU PEOPLE, WHO STORMED THE PALACE OF JUSTICE, ARE THE SAME ONES WHO ARE AMONG THE MOST PROTECTED IN THIS COUNTRY. I HAVE ALWAYS WONDERED HOW COLOMBIA DEALT WITH THE FACT THAT SANTANDER WAS THE FIRST MAN PARDONED IN COLOMBIA. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THAT MEANS THAT IF SANTANDER, A LAWMAKER, WAS PARDONED AFTER HIS ATTEMPT ON BOLIVAR'S LIFE, AND WE ARE LIVING IN A NATION BUILT LARGELY ON WHAT SANTANDER DID, THE LIFE OF MEN IS MADE OF LIGHT AND SHADES. AND THEY HAVE TO LIVE AS THEY ARE.
DEV-MUC3-1076	MEDELLIN, 30 JAN 90 -- COLOMBIAN DRUG MAFIAS HAVE DENIED THAT THEY ARE PREPARING AN ATTACK ON THE LIFE OF U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH, WHO WILL VISIT THIS CARIBBEAN COLONIAL BEACH RESORT ON 15 FEBRUARY FOR AN ANTI-DRUG SUMMIT MEETING. BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA, COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA, AND U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH WILL SIGN A MANIFESTO IN CARTAGENA THAT WAS DESIGNED IN SANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA, BOLIVIA. THE DOCUMENT WILL OUTLINE STRATEGIES THAT THEY WILL ADOPT TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING. THE MYSTERIOUS CLANDESTINE GROUP THE "EXTRADITABLES," -- THE ARMED BRANCH OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL DRUG TRAFFICKERS -- SAID IN A BULLETIN RELEASED EARLY THIS MORNING THAT THE REPORTS OF A POSSIBLE ATTACK ON BUSH IN CARTAGENA ARE FALSE. "THESE REPORTS ARE PART OF A PLAN TO UNDERMINE THE CREDIBILITY OF ALL OUR PEACE PROPOSALS," THE DOCUMENT SAID. IN THE DOCUMENT, THE "EXTRADITABLES" ALSO . LAST WEEKEND, THE U.S. CBS TELEVISION NETWORK REPORTED THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATTACK WITH ROCKETS AND MISSILES BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS ON BUSH'S PLANE IN CARTAGENA. IN A STATEMENT BY FOREIGN MINISTER JULIO LONDONO, THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT SAID THAT IT HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF TERRORIST PLANS AGAINST THE U.S. PRESIDENT, AND ADDED THAT U.S. AND COLOMBIAN SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS WERE CAPABLE OF GUARANTEEING THE SAFETY OF THE FOUR PRESIDENTS. THE EXTRADITABLES, A MAFIA GROUP BASED IN MEDELLIN, IN NORTHWEST COLOMBIAN, HAS BEEN INSISTING SINCE 17 JANUARY THAT THEY WANT A PEACE DIALOGUE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF LIBERAL PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, WHO DECLARED WAR ON THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN AUGUST, 1989.
DEV-MUC3-1077	NO CITY, NO DATE -- IN THEIR INITIAL PEACE PROPOSAL, THE EXTRADITABLES PROMISED THE SUSPENSION OF SHIPMENTS OF COCAINE TO THE UNITED STATES, THE SURRENDER OF WEAPONS, AND THE RELEASE OF PEOPLE THEY HAVE KIDNAPPED. IN COMPLYING WITH THESE PROMISES, THEY HAVE RELEASED IN GOOD CONDITION SIX HOSTAGES AND THIS PAST MONDAY BEGAN TO DELIVER DYNAMITE BY ABANDONING A SCHOOL BUS LOADED WITH 1,000 KG OF EXPLOSIVES SOUTH OF MEDELLIN. IN TODAY'S COMMUNIQUE, THE EXTRADITABLES DENIED REPORTS THAT THEY ARE HOLDING GARCIA-PENA ARCHILA. THE COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT THE EXTRADITABLES HAVE BEEN THE VICTIMS OF UNSCRUPULOUS PEOPLE WHO CALLED THE MEDELLIN MEDIA TO SAY THAT THE EXTRADITABLES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE KIDNAPPING. THEY SAY THAT AFTER HAVING RELEASED SIX HOSTAGES, THE HOLDING OF GARCIA-PENA ARCHILA, WHO IS THE HEAD OF THE VISA OFFICE OF THE COLOMBIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY, IN BOGOTA, "WOULD BE CONTRARY TO OUR PEACE OFFERS." GARCIA-PENA ARCHILA WAS RECENTLY APPOINTED ADVISER TO THE COLOMBIAN EMBASSY IN KOREA, A POST HE WAS SCHEDULED TO ASSUME FRIDAY, THE DAY HE DISAPPEARED. THE EXTRADITABLES ANNOUNCED IN THEIR COMMUNIQUE OF TODAY THAT WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS THEY WILL DELIVER A HELICOPTER BELONGING TO THE COLOMBIAN FIRM HELICOL THAT THEY HAD BEEN HOLDING. THE HELICOPTER IS LOADED WITH 500 KG OF DYNAMITE, THE COMMUNIQUE NOTES. THE DOCUMENT STATES THAT THIS DYNAMITE "WAS GOING TO BE USED AGAINST A MILITARY OBJECTIVE." THE GROUP LED BY PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA NOTES: "WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE COUNTRY OUR GOOD WILL AND OUR WISH TO HAVE PEACE AND STRENGTHEN DEMOCRACY."
DEV-MUC3-1078	SAN SALVADOR, 21 JAN 90 -- THE NATIONAL POLICE ANNOUNCED ON 20 JANUARY THAT IT HAS ABUNDANT EVIDENCE OF THE GUILT OF U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER JEAN CASOLO, WHO WAS ARRESTED ON 24 NOVEMBER IN HER HOME IN THE MIRALVALLE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THIS CAPITAL, WHERE A LARGE NUMBER OF WEAPONS AND A GREAT QUANTITY OF DOCUMENTS BELONGING TO THE FMLN-FDR WERE FOUND BURIED IN THE YARD. CASOLO WAS ARRAIGNED 8 DAYS AFTER HER ARREST, BUT WAS RELEASED BY THE JUDGE "FOR LACK OF EVIDENCE," ACCORDING TO THE JUDICIAL RECORDS. ALTHOUGH IN SALVADORAN JUDICIAL CIRCLES IT IS NOT CLEAR WHY CASOLO WAS RELEASED, IT IS BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE POLITICAL FACTORS INVOLVED. AT PRESENT, CASOLO HEADS GROUPS THAT HAVE LAUNCHED A VIRULENT CAMPAIGN AGAINST EL SALVADOR IN THE UNITED STATES, CLAIMING ALLEGED "RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION." CASOLO WAS CAPTURED AFTER THE TERRORIST FAUSTO GALLARDO VALDEZ GAVE HER NAME TO THE POLICE, TELLING THEM WHERE TO FIND THE WEAPONS THAT HE AND HIS ACCOMPLICES USED FOR TERRORIST ACTS. THE PRISONER SAID THAT THE WEAPONS WERE PROVIDED BY CASOLO AT HER HOME IN THE MIRALVALLE NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH SERVED AS A CLANDESTINE ARSENAL. IN VIEW OF THIS CONFESSION, THE POLICE REQUESTED THE PARTICIPATION OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE U.S. EMBASSY, WHO WERE PRESENT IN THE COURSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS AND WHEN THE WEAPONS WERE DUG UP IN FRONT OF CASOLO HERSELF. WHEN CASOLO RETURNED TO THE UNITED STATES, SHE ADMITTED THAT SHE HAD BURIED DOCUMENTS IN THE YARD OF THE HOUSE WHERE SHE LIVED, BUT SHE LIED BY SAYING THAT SHE DID THIS BECAUSE "IN EL SALVADOR PEOPLE COMMONLY BURY DOCUMENTS OR JEWELS TO KEEP THEM FROM BEING STOLEN BY CRIMINALS." SOURCES SAY THAT AT PRESENT, AT THE HEAD OF GROUPS OF COMMUNISTS FROM THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHO SUPPORT THEIR SALVADORAN COUNTERPARTS, CASOLO HAS BEGUN A NATIONWIDE CAMPAIGN TO DISCREDIT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNRMENT AND TO PRESSURE CONGRESS TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE AID TO OUR COUNTRY IN ORDER TO WEAKEN THE COUNTRY INSTITUTIONALLY AND STRENGTHEN THE FMLN-FDR TERRORIST GROUPS. THE POLICE REPORT THAT THE TERRORIST GALLARDO VALDEZ, FROM WHOM WEAPONS AND AMMOUNITION WERE SEIZED ON 24 NOVEMBER, SAID THAT HE HAD OBTAINED THE WEAPONS AT THE HOME OF A WOMAN WHO APPEARED TO BE A FOREIGNER ON BARCELONA AVENUE, MIRALVALLE NEIGHBORHOOD, IN SAN SALVADOR. THAT SAME DAY, POLICE INVESTIGATORS LOCATED THE HOUSE, IDENTIFIED THE PERSON LIVING THERE, AND INVITED U.S. EMBASSY OFFICIALS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SEARCH. BURIED AT THE HOUSE THEY FOUND 103 SHELLS FOR 60-MM MORTARS, 213 STICKS OF TNT, 405 ELECTRIC DETONATING CAPS, 150 FEET OF SLOW FUSES, 15 KNIVES, 3 CARTRIDGE CLIPS FOR AK-47 RIFLES, 12,510 AK-47 SHELLS, 9,110 M-16 RIFLE SHELLS, 325 G-3 RIFLE SHELLS, AND DOCUMENTS. IN HER UNOFFICIAL STATEMENT, CASOLO SAID THAT SHE DID NOT BELONG TO ANY SUBVERSIVE GROUP OR ASSOCIATION, AND THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW THE ARTICLES CAME TO BE IN HER HOUSE. ON 5 DECEMBER, CASOLO AND A GROUP OF SALVADORANS WERE ARRAIGNED BEFORE A MILITARY JUDGE, WHO 5 DAYS LATER RELEASED THEM "FOR LACK OF EVIDENCE." ON 9 DECEMBER, POLICEMEN ARRESTED A WOMAN NAMED RUTH ESPERANZA AGUILAR MARROQUIN, ALIAS MARINA, WHO WAS FLEEING AFTER HAVING PLACED A BOMB IN THE ENGINE OF A BUS. ON BEING QUESTIONED, SHE SAID SHE WAS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY ARMY, THAT THE PERSON IN CHARGE OF LOGISTICS WAS THE AMERICAN, CASOLO, AND THAT SHE HAD OBTAINED THE EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL AT CASOLO'S HOME IN MIRALVALLE. THE POLICE HAVE DENIED CASOLO'S CHARGES THAT DURING HER DETENTION SHE WAS SUBJECTED TO PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE, BECAUSE IT CAN PROVE THAT WHILE CASOLO WAS UNDER ARREST, SHE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY AN EMBASSY OFFICIAL, EVEN AT MEALTIME.
DEV-MUC3-1079	AYACUCHO, 28 JAN 90 -- THE POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT TOMAS EVANGELISTA, A LEADER OF THE RULING AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE AND DIRECTOR OF THE AYACUCHO DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, WAS SHOT DEAD BY TERRORISTS HERE TODAY. THE POLICE SAID THAT A GROUP OF HOODED INDIVIDUALS EARLY THIS MORNING ENTERED EVANGELISTA'S HOUSE AND, AFTER TYING THE HANDS OF HIS WIFE AND FIVE CHILDREN, TOOK EVANGELISTA OUT OF THE HOUSE AND SHOT HIM AT LEAST 20 TIMES. EVANGELISTA, WHO WAS 50 YEARS OLD, HAD HELD THE MOST IMPORTANT REGIONAL APRA POSTS FOR 30 YEARS. EVANGELISTA'S WIFE TOLD THE POLICE THAT BEFORE HER HUSBAND WAS KILLED, THE HOODED MAN SHOUTED THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE PRO-MAOIST SHINING PATH TERRORIST GROUP. ANTHROPOLOGIST ABIMAEL GUZMAN, THE FOUNDER OF THE SHINING PATH TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, WAS EVANGELISTA'S PROFESSOR AT THE HUAMANGA UNIVERSITY IN AYACUCHO. THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE ALSO REPORTED THAT ON 26 JANUARY SHINING PATH TERRORISTS MURDERED BROTHERS MARTIZA AND JOHN PAOLO PUZO OCHOA AND THEIR MOTHER MARTA OCHOA IN THE TOWNSHIP OF CAMPINA, 60 KM SOUTH OF AYACUCHO. WITNESSES TOLD THE POLICE THAT THE OCHOAS WERE KILLED BECAUSE THEY REFUSED TO SUPPLY FOOD AND LODGING TO THE TERRORISTS. MORE THAN 200 PEOPLE HAVE DIED SO FAR THIS MONTH OWING TO THE ARMED STRUGGLE THAT THE SHINING PATH TERRORISTS BEGAN IN 1980 AND THAT HAS ALREADY CLAIMED THE LIVES OF AT LEAST 17,700 PEOPLE AND CAUSED DAMAGE OF OVER $16 BILLION, WHICH IS THE EQUIVALENT TO THE 70 PERCENT OF THE PERUVIAN FOREIGN DEBT.
DEV-MUC3-1080	GUATEMALA CITY, 22 JAN 90 -- PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO SAID TODAY THAT "THERE WILL BE NO INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES," THUS CONFIRMING THE STATEMENT GIVEN YESTERDAY, 21 JANUARY, BY ENERGY AND MINES MINISTER RAUL CASTANEDA. THE PRESIDENT ADDED: "WHAT HAPPENED WAS A RESULT OF SPECULATION. THE GAS STATION OWNERS EXPECTED THE PRICES WOULD INCREASE WHEN THE QUETZAL'S EXCHANGE RATE CHANGED, BUT IT DID NOT HAPPEN." HE SAID THAT "THE PROBLEM WILL BE SOLVED IN A SHORT TIME BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS TAKEN CHARGE OF THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE DIFFERENTIAL SO THAT IT HAS NO IMPACT ON THE POPULATION." REFERRING TO THE WORKERS' DEMANDS FOR A SALARY INCREASE, PRESIDENT CEREZO SAID THAT "WE ARE FACING PROBLEMS IN GRANTING THE INCREASE BECAUSE THE 1990 BUDGET HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED." CEREZO ADDED: "THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WILL MAKE THE NECESSARY CONTACTS WITH THE CONGRESS OF THE REPUBLIC TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM BY REQUESTING A BUDGET EXTENSION AND GETTING THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO GRANT A SALARY INCREASE IN THE GOVERNMENT SECTOR." PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO WILL PERSONALLY SUPERVISE THE INVESTIGATING COMMISSION WHICH WAS CREATED LAST WEEK TO SOLVE THE DOUBLE MURDER PERPETRATED ON 19 JANUARY, WHICH RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF SALVADORAN POLITICAL LEADER HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES AND GUATEMALAN LAWYER HILDA AMPARO FLORES AREVALO. THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS PERSONALLY ISSUED BY THE PRESIDENT IN STATEMENTS HE GAVE TO THE MEDIA THIS MORNING IN ONE OF THE NATIONAL PALACE HALLWAYS. OQUELI COLINDRES WAS A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT OF EL SALVADOR AND HE WAS ONE OF THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL SECRETARIES FOR LATIN AMERICA. THE INVESTIGATION COMMISSION IS COMPRISED OF THREE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AND GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE NATION, THE HUMAN RIGHTS ATTORNEY, AND THE NATIONAL POLICE AND TREASURY POLICE DIRECTORS GENERAL. PRESIDENT CEREZO SAID: "THE COMMISSION'S TASK IS TO CLEAR ALL DOUBTS AND PROVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE KIDNAPPING AND SUBSEQUENT ASSASSINATION OF THESE TWO PERSONS." CEREZO REASSERTED THAT "ALL DOUBTS WILL BE CLEARED UP CONCERNING THIS GRAVE ACT OF VIOLENCE BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAD NO PARTICIPATION WHATSOEVER. THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT INTERESTED IN ELIMINATING ANYONE." THE INVESTIGATING COMMISSION HAS IMMEDIATELY BEGUN WORK. THE PRESIDENT EMPHASIZED THAT "HE WILL PERSONALLY SUPERVISE THE WORK BEING CARRIED OUT TO GUARANTEE THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT'S FIRM INTENTION OF NOT LETTING THIS CRIME, WHICH HAS BEEN CONDEMNED BY ALL THE SECTORS OF THE NATION, GO UNPUNISHED."
DEV-MUC3-1081	BOGOTA, 30 JAN 90 -- AT THIS TIME, THERE IS HEAVY FIGHTING AND EVEN ARMY BOMBING OF FARC CAMPS NEAR URIBE IN META DEPARTMENT. THE CLASHES ARE TAKING PLACE IN JARDIN DE LAS PENAS, IN MESETAS MUNICIPALITY, NEAR WHERE THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE FARC SECRETARIAT IS LOCATED. THIS REACTION BY THE MILITARY IS IN ANSWER TO A FARC AMBUSH OF A MILITARY PATROL ON 28 JANUARY, RESULTING IN FIVE SOLDIERS DEAD AND SEVEN WOUNDED. IN ADDITION, THE ARMY'S INTENSIVE ACTIONS ARE ALSO DUE TO THE DESIRE TO PUT A STOP TO FARC ATTACKS AND KIDNAPPINGS OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC LEADERS IN THE AREA.
DEV-MUC3-1082	LIMA, 30 JAN 90 -- PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA HAS CALLED FOR CALM AND SERIOUSNESS IN THE POLITICAL DEBATES AMONG THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES. HE DESCRIBED ONE OF THEM AS BEING INTELLECTUALLY IMMATURE IN VIEW OF THE CONSTANT ATTACKS THE LATTER ALWAYS MAKES. THE RIGHT, GARCIA SAID, MUST BE TAUGHT A LESSON OF MATURITY AND SERIOUSNESS. THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT THE FIRST SPECIAL CONGRESSIONAL SESSION WILL BE HELD FROM 5-6 FEBRUARY TO SPECIFICALLY DISCUSS INTERNAL BORDER DELIMITATIONS. HE ALSO SAID THAT NO NEW CENTRAL BANK DIRECTOR WILL BE APPOINTED, WHICH WILL ALLOW THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION TO DO SO. FOR THE TIME BEING, THE PRESIDENT ADDED, HE CANNOT EITHER CONFIRM OR DENY THAT HE WILL ATTEND THE ANTIDRUG SUMMIT IN COLOMBIA BECAUSE THE SITUATION IN PANAMA COULD CHANGE IN THE REMAINING 15 DAYS. MR PRESIDENT, THERE ARE STILL 16 DAYS UNTIL THE CARTAGENA SUMMIT. HAVE YOU MADE A FINAL DECISION ON WHETHER YOU WILL ATTEND OR NOT? NO, I HAVE NOT MADE A DECISION YET BECAUSE PERUVIAN FOREIGN POLICY FOLLOWS ITS PRINCIPLES, WHILE THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC -- DESPITE WHAT SOME PEOPLE MAY SAY -- FOLLOWS HIS, AND THESE PRINCIPLES ARE LOYAL TO CERTAIN ESSENTIAL CONCEPTS. WE ARE YET NOT COMPLETELY SURE THAT THE INVADING COUNTRY, THE UNITED STATES, IS TOTALLY WILLING TO OR INTENDS TO WITHDRAW ITS SOLDIERS FROM A SMALL LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY. AS LONG AS THIS DOES NOT OCCUR, AS YOU MUST UNDERSTAND, IT IS DESPICABLE AND NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SIT DOWN AT A TABLE WITH SOMEONE WHO IS ABUSING A SMALL COUNTRY WITH HIS ALMIGHTY POSITION. MANY THINGS CAN HAPPEN IN 15 OR 16 DAYS. I AM NOT SAYING EITHER YES OR NO, BUT I THINK THAT THINGS MUST SOMEHOW CHANGE FOR THE BETTER IN ORDER TO HOLD A CORDIAL MEETING. UNDER THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES, IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT THE PRESIDENTS CAN HOLD A CORDIAL MEETING AS LONG AS ONE OF THEM IS PLACING AN ATOMIC BOMB AND THE THREAT OF INVASION ON THE TABLE. YES, I THINK THAT THAT MAGAZINE IS WELL INFORMED, BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME MISUNDERSTANDINGS. AS YOU KNOW, EXPERTS FROM THE FOUR COUNTRIES MET IN SANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA, BOLIVIA, TO PREPARE A DOCUMENT. WHEN EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE READY TO SIGN THE FINAL DOCUMENT, ONE OF THE COUNTRIES PROPOSED SOME MODIFICATIONS CHANGING THE STRUCTURE OF THE CONCEPT. THE FIRST TIME I WENT TO THE UNITED NATIONS, 4 AND 1/2 YEARS AGO, I TOLD THE UNITED STATES THAT THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM OF HELICOPTERS OR BULLETS. THIS IS A PROBLEM OF BETTER PRICES FOR COCOA, COFFEE, AND ANNATTO SEEDS. THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH THE PROCESSING FACTORIES IN THE HIGHER HUALLAGA VALLEY AREA AND AIRLINES THAT TRANSPORT THESE PRODUCTS TO THE UNITED STATES. THIS CONCEPT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED AFTER 4 AND 1/2 YEARS; WHEN IT WAS FINALLY ABOUT TO BE PUT DOWN IN THE DOCUMENT IN SANTA CRUZ, ONE OF THE COUNTRIES MODIFIED IT, THUS HINDERING FURTHER PROGRESS IN THE NEGOTIATIONS. THIS SUBJECT IS NOW BEING REVIEWED, AND THE SUMMIT COULD BE POSTPONED FOR A FEW DAYS UNTIL WE REACH FULL AGREEMENT ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT SUMMIT, WHICH WAS PROPOSED BY THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENCY. WE MUST GATHER AT THE CARTAGENA SUMMIT WITH A CONCRETE PROPOSAL. IT CANNOT BE SIMPLY A SOCIAL GATHERING. WE ARE NOT TEENAGERS WHO ARE ATTENDING THE MEETING SIMPLY BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT OF THE MOST IMPORTANT COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WILL BE THERE. WE CANNOT GO THERE AS DESPERATE AND DAZZLED YOUNGSTERS TO HOLD HIS HAND. WE MUST MAKE CONCRETE PROPOSALS TO OBTAIN FUNDS FOR PERU, WORK AND HONOR FOR THE HUALLAGA VALLEY PEASANTS, AND RESPECT FOR THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY SINCE IT IS CLEAR THAT THE ORIGIN OF THE PROBLEM IS IN THE CONSUMERS OF THE RICH COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY THE UNITED STATES.
DEV-MUC3-1083	SAN SALVADOR, 31 JAN 90 -- THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS TODAY REAFFIRMED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL TO AGREE ON A DATE TO RESUME THE DIALOGUE AND THEY PROPOSED A CEASE-FIRE IN EXCHANGE FOR A SUSPENSION OF U.S. AID. IN A COMMUNIQUE FROM THE GENERAL COMMAND, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT EXPRESSED THE NEED TO "REORIENT" THE TERMS OF THE DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION SO AS TO TURN THEM INTO A NATIONAL PROCESS IN WHICH ALL THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL FORCES CAN PARTICIPATE. "WE BELIEVE THE U.S. AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS DIRECTED AGAINST DEMOCRATIZATION AND THE POLITICAL SOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT. THE SUSPENSION OF THAT AID COULD FORM PART OF A NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT THAT WOULD SIMULTANEOUSLY ENTAIL A CEASE-FIRE," THE COMMUNIQUE STATED. THE FMLN'S MESSAGE COINCIDED WITH PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S VISIT TO THE UNITED NATIONS, WHERE TODAY HE WILL MEET WITH JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR TO REQUEST HIS GOOD OFFICES TO ACHIEVE THE RESUMPTION OF THE TALKS WITH THE REBELS, WHICH HAD BEEN SUSPENDED IN OCTOBER. THE GUERRILLAS STATED THAT THEY HOPE THAT CRISTIANI'S MEETING WITH PEREZ DE CUELLAR WILL LEAD TO SETTING A DATE FOR A FUTURE MEETING. NEVERTHELESS, THE FMLN RECALLED THE 11 NOVEMBER OFFENSIVE AND WARNED THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S INSISTENCE OF THE GUERRILLAS' ALLEGED MILITARY WEAKNESS "WILL ONLY LEAD TO GREATER LEVELS OF CONFRONTATION." THE GUERRILLAS EXPRESSED THEIR "CONCERN" ABOUT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMY'S REJECTION OF PEREZ DE CUELLAR'S MEDIATION ROLE, DESCRIBING THE REJECTION AS "AN OBSTACLE TO A PROCEDURE DESIGNED TO BRING SERIOUSNESS TO THE NEGOTIATING EFFORT." "ON OUR PART," THE COMMUNIQUE STATED, "WE ACCEPT THAT MEDIATION AND WE HAVE MADE EFFORTS TOWARD ACHIEVING IT." THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WANTS PEREZ DE CUELLAR TO PLAY ONLY THE ROLE OF OBSERVER IN THE DIALOGUE PROCESS. SINCE ALFREDO CRISTIANI TOOK OFFICE ON 1 JUNE, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN HAVE HELD TWO ROUNDS OF TALKS, THE FIRST IN MEXICO IN SEPTEMBER AND THE SECOND IN COSTA RICA IN OCTOBER. THE GOVERNMENT MAINTAINS THAT THE FMLN SHOULD GIVE UP ITS WEAPONS AND JOIN THE POLITICAL PROCESS AS A PARTY. HOWEVER, THE GUERRILLAS DEMAND A PURGE OF THE ARMED FORCES AND AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION IN EXCHANGE FOR A CEASE-FIRE.
DEV-MUC3-1084	SAN SALVADOR, 31 JAN 90 -- COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE ARMED FORCES' JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, TODAY POINTED OUT THAT THE COUNTRY'S SITUATION DOES NOT WARRANT LIFTING THE CURRENT STATE OF SIEGE. THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY IS EXPECTED TO DISCUSS WHETHER TO CONTINUE THIS MEASURE NEXT WEEK. OUR STANCE IS COMPLETELY OFFENSIVE THROUGHOUT OUR NATIONAL TERRITORY. WE WILL MAINTAIN THIS POLICY WHETHER THERE IS A STATE OF SIEGE OR NOT. THE TOP MILITARY LEADER COMMENTED ON THE DECISION THAT THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY MUST MAKE ON 8 FEBRUARY. COL PONCE SAID THAT THIS IS A POLITICAL DECISION AND WHATEVER THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY DECIDES WILL BE RESPECTED BY THE ARMED FORCES. HOWEVER, HE NOTED THAT FULL GUARANTEES FOR NATIONAL SECURITY WOULD BE NONEXISTENT IF THIS MEASURE IS REPEALED. WE WILL RESPECT THE DECISION OF THE INSTITUTIONS TASKED WITH MAKING THE DECISION. WE BELIEVE THAT THE SITUATION IS NOT YET NORMAL ENOUGH TO WARRANT THE LIFTING OF THE STATE OF SIEGE. HOWEVER, THE DECISION IS IN THE HANDS OF THE ASSEMBLY OR THE GOVERNMENT. WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE NO CONDITIONS FOR LIFTING THE STATE OF SIEGE? THE PLANS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT . THE FMLN PLANS TO CONTINUE ITS TERRORIST, SELECTIVE, AND INDISCRIMINATE ACTIONS, AND ITS ATTACKS IN THE CAPITAL AND THE COUNTRYSIDE. I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE NO CONDITIONS. THE SITUATION IS NOT YET NORMAL. AS FOR AN OFFENSIVE THAT THE FMLN HAD PLANNED FOR LAST WEEK, THE MILITARY LEADER SAID THAT IT WAS FOILED BECAUSE ARMY INTELLIGENCE DETECTED IT IN TIME. COL PONCE ADDED THAT THE MOST RECENT GUERRILLA ATTACKS IN THE CAPITAL AIM TO FRIGHTEN CIVILIANS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE FMLN IS SEEKING TO MAINTAIN A PSYCHOLOGY OF FEAR AND COMPLETE INSECURITY AND DISTRUST AMONG THE POPULATION, BECAUSE THIS WORKS IN THEIR FAVOR. THEY ARE INVOLVED IN A PURELY TERRORIST, SELECTIVE, AND INDISCRIMINATE SCHEME. I HAVE MENTIONED THE INDISCRIMINATE NATURE BEFORE. THEIR RECENT ATTACKS ARE SELECTIVE. THEY SEEK TO DESTABILIZE THE GOVERNMENT, CREATE DISTRUST IN THE GOVERNMENT, AND CREATE INSECURITY. AS FOR THE VICTORIA AND MARTILLO OPERATIONS, COL PONCE SAID THAT THE FMLN HAD SUSTAINED 2,352 DEAD FROM 11 NOVEMBER 1989 TO 30 JANUARY 1990, AND HE REGRETTED THE DEATH OF 537 ARMY TROOPS.
DEV-MUC3-1085	SAN SALVADOR, 1 FEB 90 -- COL GUILLERMO ALFREDO BENAVIDES, PRIMARY PERSON IMPLICATED IN THE MURDER OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND THEIR TWO EMPLOYEES, WAS OFFICIALLY REMOVED TODAY FROM HIS POST AS DIRECTOR OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY MILITARY SCHOOL. BENAVIDES' REPLACEMENT WAS PART OF A HIGH-LEVEL REORGANIZATION IN THE ARMED FORCES WHICH, ACCORDING TO WESTERN DIPLOMATIC SOURCES, REFLECTS AN INTENTION TO MAKE GRADUAL CHANGES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, BENAVIDES, WHO IS ACCUSED OF HAVING GIVEN THE ORDER TO KILL THE JESUITS , WILL BE REPLACED AS DIRECTOR OF THE MILITARY SCHOOL BY COL RICARDO ALFONSO CASANOVA, WHO WAS FORMERLY COMMANDER OF THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE, BASED IN THE EASTERN USULUTAN DEPARTMENT. COL HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ, WHO TO DATE HAS BEEN DIRECTOR OF THE TREASURY POLICE, WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO USULUTAN, A DEPARTMENT WHERE GUERRILLAS ARE CONSTANTLY ACTIVE. HERNANDEZ WILL BE REPLACED BY COL CIRO LOPEZ ROQUE. IN ADDITION TO THE MILITARY SCHOOL AND THE TREASURY POLICE, THE CHANGES PRIMARILY AFFECT COMMANDERS IN THE AREAS OF PERSISTENT GUERRILLA ACTIVITY, SUCH AS USULUTAN AND CHALATENANGO, AND THE ARCE BATTALION, AN ELITE UNIT TO COMBAT THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT , WHICH IS BASED IN THE EASTERN DEPARTMENT OF SAN MIGUEL. THESE TRANSFERS AND APPOINTMENTS AFFECT A TOTAL OF 12 COLONELS AND, ALTHOUGH THE ARMED FORCES DESCRIBED THEM TODAY AS "ROUTINE CHANGES," DIPLOMATIC SOURCES FEEL THAT THEY ARE DESIGNED TO SEEK GREATER EFFICIENCY IN MILITARY ACTION. THE SOURCES FEEL THAT MORE CHANGES WILL BE MADE THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR. THE FIRST RESHUFFLING IN THE ARMED FORCES FOR 1990 WAS ANNOUNCED ON 1 JANUARY, THAT IS, SHORTLY AFTER THE FMLN OFFENSIVE, THE SCALE OF WHICH SURPRISED EVEN THE ARMY ITSELF, AS MILITARY SOURCES ADMITTED. ON THAT DATE, GENERAL RAFAEL BUSTILLO, CHIEF OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES AND ONE OF THE OFFICERS MOST OPENLY OPPOSED TO DIALOGUE WITH THE FMLN, WAS RELIEVED OF HIS DUTIES AND SENT TO EUROPE AS A MILITARY ATTACHE. REPLACED WITH BUSTILLO WERE THE CHIEFS OF THE MILITARY DETACHMENTS OF CUSCATLAN AND LA UNION, IN THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE CHIEF OF ARMY INTELLIGENCE.
DEV-MUC3-1086	CLANDESTINE, 2 FEB 90 -- THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT HEREBY NOTIFIES THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OF THE FOLLOWING: 1. WE SEE AS POSITIVE THAT MR CRISTIANI HAS ACCEPTED UN SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR'S PARTICIPATION IN THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS IN EL SALVADOR. WE FEEL THAT THE MEDIATION OF THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL AND THE FRAMEWORK OF THAT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION SERIOUSLY COMMIT BOTH PARTIES TO NEGOTIATION AND OFFER TRUE POSSIBILITIES SO THAT THE PROCESS WILL LEAD TOWARD A SOLUTION THAT WILL PUT AN END TO THE WAR IN OUR COUNTRY. 2. IN VIEW OF THESE POSSIBILITIES, IT IS HIGHLY NEGATIVE THAT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE ECONOMIC AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE INCREASED IN THE FORTHCOMING FISCAL PERIODS. IF THIS DECISION IS RATIFIED BY THE U.S. CONGRESS, IT WOULD MEAN A DEFINITE DETERMINATION TO PROLONG THE WAR AND THE FAILURE OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT COULD LEAD TO THE NEGOTIATED SOLUTION OF THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT. THE ASSISTANCE STRENGTHENS THE EXTREMISTS. THE POLITICAL PRESSURE MAKES IT NECESSARY TO TAKE POLITICAL ACTIONS AND STRENGTHENS THE NEGOTIATED SOLUTION. 3. THE ARMY CONTINUES TO CARRY OUT PERMANENT MILITARY OFFENSIVES AND REPRESSION. THERE CONTINUE TO BE A STATE OF SIEGE, MURDERS, ARRESTS, AND PERSECUTION AGAINST PEOPLE'S AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS; THE PRESS CONTINUES TO BE CONTROLLED; AND INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS CONTINUE TO BE VIOLATED AS THE EVACUATION OF FMLN WAR CRIPPLES IS NOT ALLOWED. COL PONCE OPENLY PROCLAIMS HIS "VICTORY AND HAMMER" OFFENSIVE AGAINST FMLN POSITIONS. THIS IS NOT COMPATIBLE, AS THE GOVERNMENT WANTS THE FMLN TO UNILATERALLY SUSPEND OPERATIONS. AS LONG AS THERE ARE REPRESSION AND LARGE MILITARY OFFENSIVES, AND A CEASE-FIRE IS NOT AGREED UPON BY THE PARTIES, WE ARE OBLIGED TO REMAIN AT WAR AND MAKE OFFENSIVE USE OF OUR MILITARY FORCE IN ANY PART OF THE NATION TO ACHIEVE SERIOUS NEGOTIATION THAT WILL FIND A JUST SOLUTION TO THE WAR. THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND 2 FEBURARY 1990, EL SALVADOR
DEV-MUC3-1087	TEGUCIGALPA, 2 FEB 90 -- SOME PEOPLE NAIVELY THINK THAT A COUNTRY CURRY FAVOR WITH THE U.S. JUST BY BEING DEMOCRATIC. SOME PEOPLE HAVE PLACED THEMSELVES AT THE SERVICE OF THIS SUPERPOWER, AS LONG AS THE SUPERPOWER HAS HAD NEED OF THEM. HOWEVER, ONCE THEY HAVE OUTLIVED THEIR USEFULNESS, NOT ONLY ARE THEY ABANDONED, BUT NOW THEY ARE EVEN KIDNAPPED, JAILED, AND SENTENCED. THIS HAPPENED TO PEREZ JIMENEZ OF VENEZUELA; LEONIDAS TRUJILLO OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, WHO WAS MURDERED BY THE CIA; SOMOZA OF NICARAGUA; AND LATELY NORIEGA OF PANAMA. THESE MEN ARE VALUED ONLY AS LONG AS THEY ARE USEFUL TO THE UNITED STATES. ONCE THEY ARE NO LONGER USEFUL, THEY ARE NO LONGER REGARDED AS MEN. APPARENTLY SOMETHING SIMILAR HAPPENS WITH COUNTRIES. IF A COUNTRY HAS ANY POLITICAL, MILITARY, OR STRATEGIC VALUE, THAT COUNTRY WILL ENJOY WASHINGTON'S PREFERENCE. HOWEVER, ONCE THE INTEREST NO LONGER EXISTS, THE AID IS OVER. IF THE INTEREST DECREASES, THE AID DECRESES. HONDURAS IS A TYPICAL EXAMPLE OF THIS POLICY FOR THE WORLD TO SEE. THE POINDEXTER TRIAL SHOWED THAT OVER THE SENATE'S OBJECTION, SPECIAL AID WAS GRANTED TO HONDURAS IN EXCHANGE FOR CONVERTING IT INTO A LEASED TERRITORY FOR CONTRA OPERATIONS. THE YEARS IN WHICH OUR TERRITORY SHAMEFULLY SERVED TO SHED BLOOD IN ONE OUR NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, ARE YEARS IN WHICH HONDURAS WAS REGARDED AS A COUNTRY DESERVING MILITARY AND ECONOMIC AID. WITH THE CHANGE OF U.S. POLICY, AFTER IT ACCEPTED ITS MILITARY FAILURE AGAINST NICARAGUA, HONDURAS IS NO LONGER THE APPLE OF ITS EYE, ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES. THAT IS WHY THE UNITED STATES IS NOT ONLY GRUDGING ITS AID, BUT IS NOT EVEN GRANTING THE SCANT AID ALREADY APPROVED, UNLESS HONDURAS AGREES TO ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS. THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE. SINCE THE UNITED STATES IS THE IMF'S MOST IMPORTANT MEMBER AND SUPPORTER, IT HAS ASKED THE IMF TO TIGHTEN THE SCREWS ON HONDURAS, AND TO EVEN LET HONDURAS USE UP ITS MEAGER GOLD RESERVES UNTIL HONDURAS IS FORCED TO SAY, "FORGIVE ME, MASTER." AS WE CAN RECALL, WHEN THE GOLD STANDARD WAS ABANDONED FOR THE DOLLAR STANDARD AND SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS, THE IMF, AND OTHER MEASURES WERE CREATED, EACH COUNTRY DEPOSITED GOLD RESEVES TO BACK UP ITS CURRENCY EXCHANGE. THEREAFTER, ITS MONETARY BACKING WOULD DEPEND ON ITS RESERVE OF DOLLARS AND OTHER STRONG CURRENCIES. THAT IS HOW GETTING FOREIGN RESERVES BECAME THE MAIN CONCERN OF NATIONS, IF THEY WANTED TO MAINTAIN THE PARITY OF THEIR CURRENCY. AS A RESULT OF THE OIL CRISIS, WHICH ON THE ONE HAND SAVED THE OIL-PRODUCING COUNTRIES, AND ON THE OTHER HAND DEALT A BLOW TO THE OIL IMPORTERS, PLUS THE UNCONTROLLED FOREIGN DEBT THAT THE PETRODOLLARS BOOM BROUGHT WITH IT, THE COUNTRIES WENT TO THE HILT IN DEBT. AT THE SAME TIME THEY LOST HUGE SUMS IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS BECAUSE OF THE DROP IN THE PRICES OF COFFEE, SILVER, TIN, COPPER, AND OTHER EXPORT PRODUCTS. IN SHORT, THE SOURCE OF EXCHANGE DECREASED FOR EVERYONE, EVEN THOUGH PRODUCTION OF EACH ITEM INCREASED. DEBTS GREW UNTIL THEY BECAME NIGHTMARES THAT ABSORBED ALMOST ALL THE COUNTRY'S FOREIGN INCOME. THE MONETARY RESERVES THAT WERE BACKING THE CURRENCIES FELL. THAT IS WHY IN LATIN AMERICA THERE HAS BEEN ONE DEVALUATION AFTER ANOTHER, COUNTRY AFTER COUNTRY. IN THE BEGINNING THE IMF USED WHAT WAS CALLED A STAND-BY LOAN, WHICH HELPED COUNTRIES WHEN THEY RAN SHORT OF RESERVES. WITH THOSE EMERGENCY LOANS THEY COULD MAINTAIN THE PARITY OF THEIR CURRENCY, UNTIL THEY COULD BALANCE THEIR RESERVES. HOWEVER, COUNTRIES LIKE HONDURAS, WHICH WERE DEEPLY INDEBTED, BEGAN TO FILL THEIR LACK OF INTERNATIONAL RESERVES WITH LOANS AND DONATIONS. EVEN SO THE COUNTRY CONTINUED TO PAY ITS IMPORTS AND EXPENSES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE, UNTIL IT REACHED THE CURRENT SITUATION IN WHICH WE CANNOT PAY THE DEBT. WE ARE OVERDUE $140 MILLION IN PAYMENTS ON OUR DEBT. OUR CREDIT IS NO LONGER GOOD. THE IMF HAS NO MORE MONEY TO GIVE TO HONDURAS TO CONTINUE ITS VICIOUS CYCLE OF GETTING INTO DEBT TO PAY OFF ITS DEBTS. YET THE UNITED STATES HAS ASKED THE IMF TO TIGHTEN OUR SCREWS.
DEV-MUC3-1088	BOGOTA, 4 FEB 90 -- WE ARE SAYING HELLO AT THIS HOUR TO NORTH SANTANDER GOVERNOR EDUARDO ASSAF ELCURE. DR ASSAF, GOOD DAY. GOOD MORNING, RCN . MR. GOVERNOR, WHAT INFORMATION DOES THE DEPARTMENTAL ADMINISTRATION HAVE ABOUT EVENTS DEALING WITH PUBLIC ORDER, SUCH AS REGRETTABLE INCIDENT IN ARBOLEDAS . THE OFFICIAL REPORTS ON THE REGRETTABLE CASE IN ARBOLEDAS AT NOON TODAY, AND THOSE CARRIED BY RCN AND OTHER STATIONS, DESCRIBING THE WAY IN WHICH MAYOR PEDRO JESUS HERNANDEZ WAS MURDERED WHILE INAUGURATING A DINING HALL FOR CHILDREN AT JUAN BUENO, ARBOLEDAS MUNICIPALITY, LEAD US TO BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING EXTREMELY SERIOUS IS HAPPENING. HERNANDEZ WAS GOING TO INAUGURATE ON 20-25 FEBRUARY FOUR OR FIVE WORKS THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMUNITIES AND HAD BEEN DEMANDED BY THEM FOR A LONG TIME. THIS LEADS US TO BELIEVE THAT THE SITUATION IS REALLY DIFFICULT AND THAT OTHER MEASURES WILL HAVE TO BE ADOPTED TO PREVENT A CONTINUATION OF THESE REGRETTABLE ACTIONS, WHICH DESTABILIZE PUBLIC ORDER IN THE DEPARTMENT. I THINK THAT AFTER THE PEACE TALKS WITH M-19 ARE CONCLUDED NEXT WEEK, DR. OCTAVIO PARDO SHOULD IN SOME WAY PROMOTE A TRUCE WITH THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY AND THE EPL TO SEE IF IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE AND KEEP THE BLOODSHED FROM CONTINUING IN OUR COUNTRY, MOST PARTICULARLY IN OUR DEPARTMENT. OVER THE COURSE OF A MONTH, TWO MAYORS, WHO WERE CHARACTERIZED AS THE FIGHTINGEST MAYORS -- IN THE SENSE THAT THEY LAUNCHED, EXECUTED, AND COMPLETED WORKS -- HAVE BEEN KILLED IN OUR DEPARTMENT. MR. GOVERNOR, HOW MANY MAYORS DID YOU SAY HAVE BEEN KILLED DURING THAT TIME? WHAT DID YOU SAY? MR. GOVERNOR, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT, FOR INSTANCE, CIVIC OR POLITICAL LEADERS IN THE AREA OF NORTH SANTANDER CAN PARTICIPATE IN TALKS WITH THE EPL AND THE ELN TO MAKE SERIOUS PROPOSALS TO THE GOVERNMENT ABOUT A POSSIBLE TRUCE, AS YOU SUGGEST? IN VIEW OF OUR CURRENT SITUATION, THAT IS, IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT A MONTH AGO THE MAYOR OF ABREGO WAS KILLED AND THE ARBOLEDAS MAYOR WAS KILLED YESTERDAY, I BELIEVE THAT THE COUNTRY IS PLEASED THAT THE PACIFICATION PROCESS WITH M-19 WILL END THIS WEEK. SO, WHY NOT LOOK FOR AVENUES OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE AND THE EPL TO ESTABLISH A TRUCE, AT LEAST DURING THIS ELECTORAL PERIOD, SO THAT ALL COLOMBIANS, ESPECIALLY THOSE OF NORTH SANTANDER, CAN FREELY EXERCISE THEIR SOVEREIGN RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN AN ELECTION AND EXPRESS THEIR SATISFACTION WITH OR CONDEMNATION OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY GOVERNING THE MUNICIPALITIES?
DEV-MUC3-1089	NO CITY, NO DATE -- YOU HAVE ALREADY HEARD THE OPINION, FOR EXAMPLE, OF THE AGRARIAN BANK, PROBABLY ALSO THAT OF ENCI , CASA, THE CORA PROJECT . THE COCA GROWERS ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE A FEW DAYS AGO STATING THAT THEY ARE NOT AGAINST THE ERADICATION OF COCA PLANTATIONS BUT COMPLAINING ABOUT THE AGRARIAN BANK'S UNSATISFACTORY SERVICE IN GRANTING LOANS. THIS COMMUNIQUE WAS PUBLISHED BY THE MEDIA A FEW DAYS AGO. YES, WE HEARD ABOUT THIS AND ARE ANALYZING IT. BUT THE PROBLEM OF THE 200,000 HECTARES USED FOR ILLEGAL COCA GROWING BY FAR EXCEEDS THE CAPACITY OF THE AGRARIAN BANK, OF THE NATIONAL COCA LEAF ENTERPRISE , OR THE ENCI TO FINANCE FERTILIZER. THIS IS A SUBJECT THAT MUST BE DISCUSSED AT THE CONTINENTAL LEVEL. THE HUALLAGA VALLEY IS AN ENCLAVE OF THE U.S. CONSUMERS. IT IS A PERVERSE PROBLEM WITH ECONOMIC REPERCUSSIONS AND IT IS DISTORTING AND DESTROYING THE POSSIBILITY OF OUR PLANTING OTHER CROPS IN THAT AREA. THIS IS WHY WE MUST CONSIDER IT FROM A CONTINENTAL VIEWPOINT, DISCUSSING IT WITH THE COUNTRY WHERE THE PROBLEM ORIGINATES, WHERE IT IS CONSUMED. THE ENCI AND THE AGRARIAN BANK PROBLEM IS IMPORTANT, BUT IT IS VERY SMALL IN COMPARISON TO THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OVERALL PROBLEM. MR. PRESIDENT, IS IT TRUE -- AS IT WAS SAID IN THE UNITED STATES -- THAT THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT IS REFUSING TO REPLACE THE PLANTATIONS BECAUSE IT IS NOT ECONOMICALLY CONVENIENT? NO, ACCORDING TO SOLID INFORMATION I HAVE AT HAND FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT IN CHARGE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING, OUR GOVERNMENT HAS MADE THE GREATEST EFFORTS DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS TO ERADICATE COCA PLANTATIONS. A FEW MONTHS AGO THEY RELEASED A REPORT TO THE U.S. MEDIA FROM MAY 1989 THAT SHOWED THAT PERU HAD BROKEN ALL RECORDS FOR ERADICATING COCA IN 1988, IN KEEPING WITH ITS INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS. PERU ERADICATED MORE THAN 5,000 HECTARES OF COCA PLANTATIONS THAT YEAR, THUS STABILIZING THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF HECTARES USED FOR COCA GROWING. NOBODY, MUCH LESS THE UNITED STATES, CAN SAY THAT PERU HAS DONE NOTHING. WE HAVE CARRIED OUT VAST OPERATIONS AND HAVE CONTINUED OUR SILENT TASK TO ERADICATE THESE PLANTATIONS, SOMETIMES WITH REGRETTABLE CONSEQUENCES. THE PEASANT WHO IS FACED WITH BARE LAND AFTER THE COCA IS UPROOTED EITHER ENGAGES IN TERRORIST ACTIVITIES OR IS CONDEMNED TO LIVE IN MISERY. THIS IS WHY WE NEED AN OVERALL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ALTERNATIVE THAT MUST BE PART OF A REEVALUATED LATIN AMERICAN-U.S. RELATIONSHIP. MR. PRESIDENT, THE SITUATION IS NOW THE OPPOSITE TO WHAT THE UNITED STATES IS DOING FOR A MEETING PUT FORWARD BY THE PRESIDENTS, BECAUSE THEY GIVE $1 TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING WHILE THERE ARE $100 FOR CONSUMPTION. YOU ARE RIGHT. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE TOTAL COST OF COCAINE SOLD ON THE U.S. STREETS IS $100 BILLION. ONLY $8 OR $9 MILLION IS BEING OFFERED TO FIGHT THE ILLEGAL PRODUCTION OF COCA AND TO REPLACE THE CROPS HERE IN PERU. WHAT THE UNITED STATES -- THE MAIN CONSUMER -- HAS BEEN OFFERING IS NOT PROPORTIONAL TO THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM. IF THERE WERE NO CONSUMPTION IN THE UNITED STATES, PERU WOULD NOT PRODUCE COCA LEAVES, EXCEPT FOR THE TRADITIONAL, ANCIENT USES OF PERUVIAN PEOPLE. THE PROBLEM BEGINS THERE. THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROVIDING MASSIVE RESOURCES SHOULD BE ASSUMED THROUGH CONCERTED DIALOGUE, NOT UNILATERAL MEASURES, BECAUSE THERE ARE HAWKS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE HAWKS ARE THE BOLDEST MILITARISTS WHO BELIEVE THAT TROOPS CAN BE SENT TO THE HUALLAGA VALLEY, THUS SOLVING THIS SERIOUS PROBLEM. SUCH AN ACTION WOULD REPRESENT THE VIOLATION OF A NATION'S SOVEREIGNTY, AN UNWANTED UNILATERAL INTERVENTION. WE WANT A SERIOUS, RESPONSIBLE, CONCERTED, FAR-REACHING SOCIOECONOMIC POLICY. THIS IS OUR OBJECTIVE FOR CARTAGENA. MR. PRESIDENT, CHANGING THE SUBJECT, THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN HAS ENTERED THE FINAL STRETCH. OPPOSITION PARTIES HAVE CONSTANTLY MENTIONED YOUR NAME AND WHAT YOU HAVE SAID OR HAVE NOT SAID. WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF THE CAMPAIGN? THOSE ARE MINOR SINS BY THE OPPOSITION. THEY ARE USING ELEMENTS THAT ARE NOT TOTALLY LEGITIMATE, BUT I WILL NOT WASTE MY TIME PASSING JUDGMENT ON MY DEAR FRIEND ENRIQUE CHIRINO SOTO OR ON ANY OF THE LAWMAKERS. I UNDERSTAND THEIR DESIRE AND THEIR NEED TO BE ELECTED. OTHERWISE WHAT WOULD THEY DO IN THE FUTURE? IF THEY WANT TO USE MY NAME, LET THEM USE IT, EVEN IF IT'S IN A NEGATIVE WAY. I HAVE LISTENED TO SO MANY THINGS OVER FOUR AND A HALF YEARS IN OFFICE THAT I AM ACTUALLY A LITTLE PLEASED BY THE FACT THAT THEY ARE DESPERATELY USING MY NAME. AT LEAST I AM HELPING THEM. SINCE THE ELECTIONS WILL BE HELD ON 8 APRIL, WHEN WILL SCHOOL CLASSES BEGIN? I SAW THAT THE EDUCATION MINISTRY ISSUED A NOTE ANNOUNCING THAT CLASSES WILL BEGIN ON 1 OR 2 APRIL. I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE TO THE EDUCATION MINISTER THAT CLASSES BEGIN AFTER 8 APRIL. IT WOULD BE MEANINGLESS TO BEGIN CLASSES AND TO THEN DISCONTINUE THEM IN ORDER TO OPEN THE SCHOOLS FOR THE ELECTIONS. CLASSES COULD THEREFORE BEGIN ON 10 APRIL OR WHEN THE MINISTRY DECIDES. THIS SHOULD BE AFTER 8 APRIL. WE SHOULD CONCENTRATE ALL OF OUR EFFORTS ON OPENING THE VOTING SITES. I AM ANNOUNCING THAT CLASSES WILL BEGIN AFTER 8 APRIL.
DEV-MUC3-1090	TEGUCIGALPA, 6 FEB 90 -- PRESIDENT RAFAEL LEONARDO CALLEJAS ROMERO SAID TUESDAY HONDURAS IS FACING AN EXTREMELY CHALLENGING SITUATION AND THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA CAN HELP A GREAT DEAL IN SOLVING THE PROBLEMS CONFRONTING HIS COUNTRY. CALLEJAS, INAUGURATED ON JAN. 27, TOLD THE CNA HONDURAS IS FACING A CRISIS WHICH HIS NEW ADMINISTRATION, WITH HELP AND SUPPORT FROM THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA, WILL BE ABLE TO TIDE OVER. HONDURAS LACKS FOREIGN EXCHANGE TO BUY OIL, MEDICINE AND FOOD FROM ABROAD. TEGUCIGALPA'S FOREIGN DEBTS TOTAL WELL OVER U.S. DLRS 200 MILLION. "WE ARE FACING A STEEP SHORTAGE OF BASIC FOODS, CORN IN PARTICULAR," CALLEJAS SAID. A POTENTIALLY RICH COUNTRY, HONDURAS CAN OVERCOME ALL ITS DIFFICULT PROBLEMS AND ACHIEVE PROSPERITY IN THE LONG RUN, BUT IT NEEDS A SHOT IN THE ARM, CALLEJAS SAID. THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA, CALLEJAS APPEALED, CAN EXTEND "SHORT-TERM BRIDGE LOANS" TO HONDURAS TO HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF ACUTE SHORTAGE IN FOOD AND OTHER NECESSITIES. "A SHORT-TERM CREDIT OF DLRS 5 MILLION, FOR INSTANCE, CAN HELP US MAKE UP FOR THE SHORTAGE AND THEN WE CAN MOVE AHEAD," CALLEJAS SAID. "THE SITUATION IS A CRITICAL ONE," CALLEJAS SAID, "BUT WE WILL BE ABLE TO COPE WITH IT AND SURGE AHEAD FOR GREATER PROSPERITY, AND WHAT WE NOW NEED IS A SHORT-TERM HELP FROM OUR FRIENDS IN THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA." HE SAID THE PEOPLE OF HONDURAS HAVE YET TO SENSE THE CRISIS THEY ARE FACING NOW. THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, IN PARTICULAR, IS COMPARABLE TO THE ONE THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA FACED IN AND SHORTLY AFTER 1950. "MY ADMINISTRATION KNOWS WHAT SHALL BE DONE," CALLEJAS SAID. HE WILL LET THE PEOPLE FULLY UNDERSTAND THE CRISIS AND CULTIVATE A SENSE OF CRISIS THAT IS NEEDED TO RALLY THEMSELVES BEHIND THE GOVERNMENT TO MOVE FORWARD. THE PEOPLE OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA HAVE SET A "GOOD EXAMPLE" FOR OTHER NATIONS IN CRISIS TO FOLLOW, CALLEJAS SAID. "OVER THE PAST 40 YEARS," HE POINTED OUT, "YOU HAVE DEMONSTRATED WHAT CAN BE DONE TO OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTIES AND ACHIEVE PROSPERITY." ASIDE FROM THE SHORT-TERM CREDIT, THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA CAN SEND A HIGH-LEVEL MISSION TO ADVISE HONDURAS ON HOW TO SOLVE ITS LONG-TERM FINANCIAL PROBLEM, CALLEJAS SAID. "YOUR COUNTRY HAS EXPERIENCE IN THIS FIELD," HE ADDED, "AND WE HOPE WE WILL BENEFIT FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE." ANOTHER FIELD OF COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES IS TRADE AND INVESTMENT, CALLEJAS SAID. HONDURAS IS SETTING UP AN INDUSTRIAL PARK, AND INVESTMENT FROM THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA IS MORE THAN WELCOME, HE ADDED. THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA IS OPENING ITS MARKET TO FOREIGN IMPORTS, AND A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF TAIWAN'S TOBACCO MARKET, IF HONDURAS CAN EARN IT, "WILL HELP A GREAT DEAL AND START A CHAIN ACTION OF DEVELOPMENT," CALLEJAS SAID. THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE GENERATED FROM THE SALES OF TOBACCO CAN BE USED TO PAY BACK SOME OF TEGUCIGALPA'S FOREIGN DEBT. THE REPAYMENT WILL EARN MORE INTERNATIONAL CREDIT, WHICH IN TURN SUPPORTS OTHER PROJECTS OF DEVELOPMENT. THE PRESENCE OF A U.N. MILITARY OBSERVER GROUP IN HONDURAS, CALLEJAS SAID, WILL HELP STABILIZE THE SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA. THE MISSION IS TO HELP EASE THE TENSION ALONG THE BORDERS OF EL SALVADOR AND NICARAGUA, WHICH WAS HEIGHTENED BY GUERRILLA ACTIVITIES. CALLEJAS HAS VISITED THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA TWICE BEFORE. HE TOURED THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA AS MINISTER OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN 1968 AND AGAIN AS CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL PARTY IN 1988. ASKED IF HE WOULD ATTEND THE PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION IN TAIPEI ON MAY 20, CALLEJAS SAID HE WOULD "TRY MY BEST TO GO MYSELF." IF HE IS UNABLE TO ATTEND, HE ADDED, HE WILL SEND HIS PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS, RODOLFO IRIAS NAVAS. "IF I CANNOT VISIT THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA IN MAY," CALLEJAS SAID, "I WILL MAKE A VISIT TO YOUR COUNTRY BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR." MOST LIKELY, HE ADDED, HE WILL PAY A STATE VISIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA IN NOVEMBER. IN RETURN, CALLEJAS SAID, "WE WILL BE HONORED TO HAVE YOUR PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT LI, VISIT US." RELATIONS BETWEEN HONDURAS AND THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA ARE "EXTREMELY CLOSE ONES," CALLEJAS SAID. "AND WE IN HONDURAS HOPE TO FURTHER CEMENT THOSE EXTREMELY GOOD RELATIONS," HE POINTED OUT. SUCH GOOD RELATIONSHIPS SHOULD NOT BE MONOPOLIZED BY THE GOVERNMENTS, CALLEJAS SAID. "WE NEED MORE CONTACT AMONG THE PEOPLE IN ALL WALKS OF LIFE, ON CULTURAL, SOCIAL AND COMMERCIAL LEVELS, SO THAT WE MAY CONTINUE IMPROVING THE EXTREMELY GOOD RELATIONSHIP THAT HAS EXISTED BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES," HE POINTED OUT.
DEV-MUC3-1091	GUATEMALA CITY, 6 FEB 90 -- THIS MORNING PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO HOSTED A NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE PRESIDENT'S PALACE OFFICE. THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN OUR COUNTRY. IN ADDITION, PRESENTED BY THE UNITED NATIONS RAPPORTEUR OF THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION. OF THE COMMISSION THAT HAS ARRIVED IN GUATEMALA . WE ALL MUST ADMIT THAT IN 1989 THERE WAS THAT CREATED AN ATMOSPHERE OF TERRORISM AND . ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS AND IN SEVERAL CRIMINAL AND POLITICAL CASES, IT WAS DECIDED THAT THAT CONTINUES PROGRESSING, BUT THERE IS AN EVEN BETTER WAY YET. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT THE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS ARE MAKING MORE PROGRESS EACH DAY AND BECOMING MORE OPERATIONAL. THE AUTHORITIES ARE BECOMING MORE COOPERATIVE EVERY DAY WITH THE VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION. TO CREATE A NEW SYSTEM FOR LOCATING MISSING PEOPLE. WE HAVE FOUND A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS US TO LOCATE MANY MISSING PEOPLE, AND . . FRANKLY SPEAKING, IS A SERIOUS MAN WHO DESERVES ALL OF MY TRUST AND RESPECT FOR HIS CAPABILITIES. HE HAS SAID THAT WE HAVE PROBLEMS IN CONTROLLING SOME TERRORIST GROUPS, AND WHAT WE NEED IS ASSISTANCE IN IMPROVING OUR EFFICIENCY. HE HAS POINTED OUT SOME DEFECTS IN OUR PENAL PROCEDURES WHICH MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO KEEP THESE PEOPLE IN PRISON. HOWEVER, HIS CONCLUSIONS DO NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT WE ARE GETTING WORSE. THAT HAS NOT BEEN MENTIONED IN THE NEWS. HIS CONCLUSIONS NOTES THAT IN SPITE OF THESE OBSERVATIONS THAT HE HAD TO MAKE AS UNITED NATIONS OBSERVER FOR GUATEMALA, THE SITUATION IN OUR COUNTRY HAS OBVIOUSLY IMPROVED, COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS YEARS. WE ARE TAKING ALL OF THIS INTO CONSIDERATION. THIS HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN A WRITTEN REPORT THAT WILL BE NOTED IN GENEVA IN ORDER TO CONSIDER TREATMENT FOR GUATEMALA.
DEV-MUC3-1092	GUATEMALA CITY, 24 JAN 90 -- A SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL MISSION, MADE UP OF PROMINENT LEADERS OF THAT ORGANIZATION, ARRIVED IN THE COUNTRY ON 23 JANUARY TO "DEMAND" THAT THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT CONDUCT AN EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATION INTO THE MURDER OF SALVADORAN OPPOSITION LEADER HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES AND GUATEMALAN GILDA FLORES. THEIR KIDNAPPING AND SUBSEQUENT MURDER TOOK PLACE IN OUR COUNTRY AND THUS, GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES, WITHOUT ANY KIND OF MEDDLING, SHOULD SOLVE THIS CASE. GUATEMALAN COURTS OF JUSTICE HAVE THE DUTY TO REQUEST, AS PART OF THE INVESTIGATION, THE TESTIMONIES OF WITNESSES AND CONCLUSIONS OF EXPERTS INVOLVED IN THE CASE. ACCORDING TO GUATEMALAN LAW, THERE IS A PERIOD ALLOTTED FOR INITIAL INVESTIGATIONS DURING WHICH NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS CAN BE MADE OR PRESSURES EXERTED WHICH MIGHT HAMPER THE COURSE OF JUSTICE. THIS IS WHY THE FACT THAT A DELEGATION, WHICH IS MADE UP OF RESPECTABLE PEOPLE WHO DESERVE OUR ADMIRATION, NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THEIR OUTSTANDING POLITICAL VIRTUES, BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THEIR HONEST BEHAVIOR AS CITIZENS, IS COMING TO "DEMAND" THAT OUR AUTHORITIES INVESTIGATE THE CRIME, AS IF THEY WERE NOT ALREADY OFFICIALLY DOING SO, IS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT HAMPERING JUSTICE. IT HAPPENS THAT THE ILLUSTRIOUS VISITORS CAME HERE WITH THE EVIDENT GOAL OF ACCUSING THE ALLEGED AUTHORS OF THE DOUBLE CRIME. IN PUBLIC STATEMENTS, THEY HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT "FORCES OF THE GUATEMALAN AND SALVADORAN EXTREME RIGHT" MURDERED THEM. THESE STATEMENTS ARE AS UNCALLED FOR AS THOSE UTTERED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IN EL SALVADOR WHEN HE SAID THAT THE MURDERERS OF THE SIX UCA JESUITS WERE FMLN GUERRILLAS AND WAS LATER FORCED TO RETRACT, WHEN THE INVESTIGATIONS REVEALED THAT MEMBERS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES CARRIED OUT THE MURDER. IN THE FACE OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE, AND THE COMDEMNATION OF THE BRUTAL MURDER OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADERS, PRESIDENT CEREZO DECIDED TO ESTABLISH AN INVESTIGATIVE COMMISSION TO WHICH HE PLANS TO ADD A REPRESENTATIVE OF AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION. ON 23 JANUARY THE SOCIALIST DELEGATE WHO IS IN THE COUNTRY CLEARLY REFERRED TO A LEGALLY REGISTERED GUATEMALAN POLITICAL PARTY, WHICH ENJOYS FULL POLITICAL RIGHTS, AS THE "NANNY" PARTY OF THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE, ARENA, OF EL SALVADOR. HE IS LEVELLING SERIOUS CHARGES, WHICH COULD EVEN CREATE LEGAL AND POLITICAL CONFLICTS BETWEEN GUATEMALA AND EL SALVADOR, BY INSISTING THAT THE CRIME WAS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED, WHICH SEEMS TO BE EVIDENT, AND BY LINKING THE CRIME TO POLITICAL PARTIES OF THE TWO COUNTRIES. WITH THE DUE RESPECT THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION DESERVES, THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE SHOULD BE CONSULTED ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE DONE NEXT BECAUSE THE CASE IS UNDER THE PURVIEW OF GUATEMALAN COURTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN JUTIAPA JURISDICTION. THOSE COURTS SHOULD BE THE ONES TASKED WITH COLLECTING THE EVIDENCE, ISSUING THE SUMMONS, AND MAKING THE NECESSARY STATEMENTS. ANYTHING ELSE CONSTITUTES INTERFERING WITH JUSTICE. IN THIS REGARD, THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT CEREZO IS GUESSING ABOUT WHO MIGHT BE THE AUTHOR OF THIS REPUDIABLE BLOODY MURDER IS INAPPROPRIATE BECAUSE IT IS NOT HIS DUTY TO DO SO, EVEN IF THE SOCIALISTS THREATEN TO SEEK CONDEMNATION AGAINST GUATEMALA AT THE UNITED NATIONS FOR VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS WHICH ARE LOOMING OVER HIS GOVERNMENT.
DEV-MUC3-1093	SAN SALVADOR, 7 FEB 90 -- COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, CATEGORICALLY DENIED TODAY THAT THERE ARE ANY RIFTS BETWEEN SALVADORAN ARMY OFFICERS AND U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS, AS ASSERTED THIS WEEK BY THE U.S. MEDIA. "I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THIS. OUR RELATIONS WITH THE NORTH AMERICANS ARE NORMAL AS USUAL," PONCE SAID TO JOURNALISTS, ADDING, "THE U.S. ADVISERS HAVE HELPED US VERY MUCH IN THE PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE ARMED FORCES, AND THEY CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US." THE MILITARY OFFICER STATED: "THERE ARE ALWAYS THOSE WHO TRY TO FORCE OR BREAK THE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES AND THE UNITED STATES." REPORTS FROM THE U.S. CONGRESS SAID THAT THE ARREST OF EIGHT ARMY MEMBERS LINKED WITH THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO WOMEN ON 16 NOVEMBER HAS PROVOKED SERIOUS DISPUTES BETWEEN SOME MILITARY COMMANDERS AND THE U.S. ADVISER CORPS DETACHED TO THE COUNTRY. PONCE PARTICIPATED ON WEDNESDAY, 7 FEBRUARY, IN THE CEREMONY TO TURN OVER COMMAND OF THE MILITARY SCHOOL TO COLONEL RICARDO CASANOVA, REPLACING COLONEL GUILLERMO BENAVIDES, ONE OF THE MEN INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUITS. PONCE REPORTED THAT THE MILITARY OFFICERS ACCUSED OF THE CRIME ARE IMPRISONED AT THE NATIONAL POLICE GENERAL HEADQUARTERS, BUT THEY ARE STILL IN ACTIVE SERVICE AND ARE RECEIVING A SALARY WHILE THE COURTS ISSUE A RULING ON THIS CASE.
DEV-MUC3-1094	MANAGUA , 5 FEB 90 -- DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS, THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR CONTINUISM, DANIEL ORTEGA, HAS BEEN INSISTING ON HIS INTENTION OF A QUICK RECONCILIATION WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. NEVERTHELESS, HE SAYS SO AMID SLANDER AND THREATS THAT INVALIDATE THE SINCERITY OF HIS REMARKS. FOR ORTEGA AND HIS SPOKESMEN, TO BE RESPECTED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND TO MANAGE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED STATES IS NOW HIS PARTY'S "BEST GUARANTEE," THAT PARTY'S GREAT ELECTORAL OFFER. THE ONLY POSSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THIS INCOHERENT AND CONTRADICTORY ATTITUDE IS AS A REELECTION STRATEGY, REALIZING THE POPULARITY OF THE IDEA OF NORMALIZING FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION. ORTEGA HAS NOT WANTED TO REMAIN DISTANCED FROM THAT ASPIRATION, WHICH THE PEOPLE JUDGE AS INDISPENSABLE TO IMPROVE THE CRISIS THEY ARE IN. THE TRUTH IS THAT ANY UNNECESSARY DISTANCING OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE SANDINISTS WAS DUE TO THE LATTER'S INITIATIVE. EVERYONE KNOWS THE EFFORTS MADE BY BOTH MR BOWDLER AS WELL AS LAWRENCE PEZULLO TO ATTAIN CORDIAL RELATIONS WITH THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT THAT FOLLOWED SOMOZA DEBAYLE'S. THE STRONG PRESSURES ON THE DICTATOR TO RESIGN WERE DECISIVE IN HIS DEPARTURE. THE CARTER GOVERNMENT'S MASSIVE AND EARLY AID WAS DECISIVE IN STABILIZING THE REVOLUTIONARY REGIME. THE FSLN NATIONAL DIRECTORATE, HOWEVER, HAD OTHER INSTRUCTIONS FROM HAVANA. AS SOON AS THEY GOT OUT OF THE AIRPLANE, THEY TOOK IT OUT ON THE "YANKEES, ENEMY OF HUMANITY," WHICH WERE ONLY SEEKING AN UNPREJUDICED RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NEW LEADERS. THAT RHETORIC WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS OBVIOUS IF IT HAD NOT BEEN THAT THE TRUE PURPOSE OF THAT CONFRONTATION CAMPAIGN WAS TO JUSTIFY ITS MISSION OF SETTING CENTRAL AMERICA ON FIRE AND THUS DISTRACTING THE UNITED STATES WITH A STRATEGY OF DESTABILIZING THE AREA, WHICH IS CONVENIENT TO USSR INTERESTS. THE FMLN'S GENERAL STAFF MOVED TO NIACARAGUA, AND THE CLANDESTINE RADIO STATION VENCEREMOS BEGAN BROADCASTING FROM MANAGUA WHILE THE WHOLE COUNTRY BECAME A SANCTUARY FOR SALVADORAN TERRORISTS AND A LOGISTICS RESUPPLY BASE. THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION MADE ONE LAST EFFORT AT MANZANILLO, BUT DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER TINOCO ONLY WENT TO READ A PREPARED TEXT, USING THAT BRILLIANT OPPORTUNITY AS A CENTER STAGE FOR PROPAGANDA AND DISTURBANCE. MENAWHILE, THE SLOGAN "IF NICARAGUA WON, SO WILL EL SALVADOR," FLOODED RADIO STATIONS, BANNERS, WATCHWORDS, GRAFFITI, AND BOASTFUL SPEECHES, WHILE THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS MADE EVERY EFFORT TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT AND THE GUATEMALAN REVOLUTIONARY BANDS DID LIKEWISE, DEVASTATING EL PETEN. DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE ENDERS CAME HIMSELF TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE FSLN'S GENERAL DIRECTORATE, PROPOSING AN ARRANGEMENT THAT WOULD GUARANTEE STABILITY IN EXCHANGE FOR THEIR MESSIAH-LIKE PROJECT OF SUBVERTING THE REGION. WHEN THESE TALKS FAILED, WHAT FOLLOWED WAS INEVITABLE AND IS REGRETTABLE. NOW, EVEN THOUGH THE SANDINISTS MAY TRY AFTER 10 YEARS TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME, TRYING TO PUT THINGS RIGHT, THE RECIPE CONTINUES TO BE THE SAME: ONE, "GENUINELY FREE AND JUST" ELECTIONS IN NICARAGUA, AND TWO, THE REMOVAL OF THEIR INCITING HANDS FROM CENTRAL AMERICA. ON THESE LINES, SECRETARY OF STATE JAMES BAKER'S DECLARATION LAST WEEK WAS CLEAR AND CATEGORICAL: CONVINCING PROOF THAT THE ELECTIONS WERE HONEST, "SOMETHING VERY HARD TO DETERMINE, UNLESS ORTEGA ALLOWS CONGRESSINAL OBSERVERS," AND CONVICING PROOF THAT NICARAGUA HAS STOPPED SENDING ARMS TO EL SALVADOR. IF THE ELECTIONS ARE FRAUDULENT, SENTENCE HAS ALREADY BEEN PASSED: "THE UNITED STATES COULD MAKE NICARAGUA'S SITUATION TOUGHER." IN OTHER WORDS, ORTEGA WOULD CONFIRM HIMSELF ONLY AS A GUARANTOR OF WAR AND MISERY.
DEV-MUC3-1095	SANTIAGO, 10 FEB 90 -- PRESIDENT AUGUSTO PINOCHET SAID HERE THAT THIS IS THE LAST CITY HE WILL VISIT DURING THE FIRST PART OF HIS NATIONWIDE TOUR TO BID TAKE LEAVE OF THE CITIZENRY AS CHIEF OF STATE. HE ALSO THANKED THE CHILEAN PEOPLE FOR THEIR HARD WORK TO MAKE PROGRESS. THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WAS PLEASED TO OBSERVE OPTIMISM AMONG THE PEOPLE IN THE NORTHERN REGION AS IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. PINOCHET SAID IN COPIAPO THAT THOSE WHO TRY TO TARNISH THE HONOR OF THE ARMED FORCES AND FORCES OF ORDER ARE AGAINST CHILE. HE MADE THESE STATEMENTS DURING A PUBLIC CEREMONY AT THE ALHAMBRA THEATRE IN COPIAPO, WHERE HE WAS HONORED FOR HIS GOVERNMENT WORK IN THE PAST 16 YEARS. AFTER ENUMERATING THE ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE THIRD REGION, THE PRESIDENT REFERRED TO HIS COMPLETED MISSION. WE HAVE COMPLETED OUR MISSION BECAUSE WE HAVE BEHAVED IN KEEPING WITH THE ARMED FORCES TRADITION. WE MAINTAINED THE HONOR WE INHERITED FROM OUR HISTORIC HEROES. THOSE WHO IGNORE THE GREAT WORK CARRIED OUT BY THE NATIONAL DEFENSE INSTITUTIONS ARE BEING IRRESPONSIBLE WITH HISTORY. THOSE WHO TRY TO TARNISH THE HONOR OF THE ARMED FORCES AND FORCES OF ORDER ARE AGAINST CHILE AND ITS ESSENTIAL INSTITUTIONS. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. BEFORE MEETING WITH THE COPIAPO CITIZENRY, THE PRESIDENT ALSO REFERRED TO THE VIOLENT ATTACKS THAT TOOK PLACE IN SANTIAGO. HE SAID THAT THESE ATTACKS WILL NOT HINDER THE TALKS ON THE TRANSFER OF POWER. HE ADDED THAT HE DID NOT HAVE FULL REPORTS ON THE SUBVERSIVE ATTACK. I THINK IT IS NORMAL, A SITUATION IN KEEPING WITH THE DYNAMICS OF CURRENT POLITICS. I DO NOT FORESEE GREATER CONSEQUENCES TO IT. WHEN I GET BACK THERE POSSIBLY MR. PRESIDENT, THERE HAS BEEN A TERRORIST ATTACK IN THE CAPITAL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT? I CANNOT TELL YOU, I HAVE BEEN TOLD OVER THE PHONE, BUT IT IS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION WHICH I CANNOT REPEAT, BUT I DO NOT THINK IT IS TOO SERIOUS. MR. PRESIDENT, THAT DOES NOT BREAK AWAY . ACCORDING TO WHAT I KNOW SO FAR, NOTHING HAS HAPPENED THAT COULD TURN INTO ANYTHING MORE SERIOUS. THINGS ARE GOING ALONG JUST THE SAME, WITH THE SMALL PROBLEMS THAT ARISE DAILY WITHIN THE DYNAMICS OF POLITICS, BUT AS I JUST SAID, I DO NOT THINK . MR. PRESIDENT, DO YOU THINK THAT THIS ATTACK WAS COMMITTED BY THOSE WHO ESCAPED FROM THE SANTIAGO PRISON? THAT IS WHAT I MEAN; I DO NOT THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT SINCE REACTIONS OF VIOLENCE HAVE INCREASED. IT COULD HAVE BEEN THEM. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION I GOT, IT COULD BE SERIOUS BUT NOT AS MUCH AS TO THINK THAT THIS IS THE END OF THE WORLD. FINALLY, PRESIDENT PINOCHET SAID HE STILL HAD NO FURTHER REPORTS ON THE TERRORIST ATTACK IN WHICH ANOTHER CARABINERO WAS SLAIN, AND HE REGRETTED THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CNI WHICH WAS A SPECIALIZED ORGANIZATION WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE TERRORIST CELLS. THE CHIEF OF STATE WILL END HIS TOUR OF NORTHERN CHILE IN SERENA. HE WILL RETURN TO SANTIAGO TODAY.
DEV-MUC3-1096	SAN SALVADOR, 7 FEB 90 -- COL. RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHIEF OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF, SAID TODAY THAT 145 GUERRILLAS AND 53 SOLDIERS HAD BEEN KILLED IN 386 CLASHES IN JANUARY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE COUNTERINSURGENCY OPERATION "VICTORIA." COL. PONCE SAID THAT THE ARMY HAD DESTROYED 61 CAMPS AND THWARTED 48 LOGISTICAL GUERRILLA OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IN JANUARY, WHILE THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT SAID IT HAD INFLICTED 532 ARMY CASUALTIES, INCLUDING 10 OFFICERS, IN ARMED CONFRONTATIONS DURING THE MONTH. COL. PONCE HELD THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE "MURDER" OF 19 PEOPLE AND ADDED THAT 22 REBELS HAD DESERTED FROM THE FMLN RANKS. HE STATED THAT THE REBELS HAD CONDUCTED 235 SABOTAGE OPERATIONS AGAINST THE TELEPHONE, ENERGY, AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND PRIVATE PROPERTY. OPERATION "VICTORIA," WHICH BEGAN IN JANUARY, WAS AIMED AT ATTACKING THE GUERRILLA GROUPS THAT STAYED BEHIND IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR AND THE COUNTRY'S MAIN CITIES AFTER THE REBEL OFFENSIVE OF 11 NOVEMBER 1989. PONCE SAID THAT 45 PERCENT OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY IS PARTICIPATING IN THE NATIONWIDE OPERATION "VICTORIA." THE ARMY CONFISCATED 186 WEAPONS OF VARIOUS CALIBERS DURING THE CONFRONTATIONS IN JANUARY. PONCE ADDED THAT 1,980 PEOPLE, MOST OF THEM YOUTHS, HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED BY THE REBELS SINCE 11 NOVEMBER AND ARE RECEIVING GUERRILLA TRAINING IN CHALATENANGO, MORAZAN, AND USULUTAN DEPARTMENTS. ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SOURCES, IN THE LAST DECADE THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA MOVEMENT HAS CAUSED ECONOMIC LOSSES TO THE COUNTRY OF APPROXIMATELY $430 MILLION AS A RESULT OF TELECOMMUNICATION AND ENERGY SABOTAGE OPERATIONS.
DEV-MUC3-1097	CARACAS , 10 FEB 90 -- COLOMBIAN FOREIGN MINISTER JULIO LONDONO PAREDES SAID TODAY THAT IT IS VERY HARD TO THINK OF SOME IMPORTANT BREAKTHROUGH IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS "WHEN AT THE SAME TIME THE INTERNATIONAL COFFEE AGREEMENT COLLAPSES AND TARIFFS AND OBSTACLES ARE RAISED AGAINST OUR NATIONS' EXPORT PRODUCTS." IN AN INTERVIEW PUBLISHED TODAY BY THE VENEZUELAN DAILY NEWSPAPER EL NACIONAL, LONDONO NOTED THAT THE ANTIDRUG SUMMIT SCHEDULED TO BE HELD IN CARTAGENA NEXT WEEK IS IMPORTANT IN THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND SEVERAL COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY THE UNITED STATES, HAVE BEGUN TO REALIZE THAT "THE DRUG PROBLEM IS UNIVERSAL." "IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE UNITED STATES, WHICH WAS DECLARING US SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROBLEMS ONLY FOUR YEARS AGO, BE REPRESENTED BY ITS PRESIDENT AT A MEETING WITH HIS COLOMBIAN, PERUVIAN, AND BOLIVIAN COUNTERPARTS, AND THUS PROPERLY ASSUME ITS ROLE AS COPARTICIPANT AND A PARTY JOINTLY RESPONSIBLE IN THIS MATTER," HE SAID. IN ANSWER TO A QUESTION AS TO WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH THE GOOD-NEIGHBOR COMMITTEES IN HIS COUNTRY AFTER HE STEPS DOWN DUE TO THE CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION IN COLOMBIA, LONDONO SAID: "THE COLOMBIAN COMMISSION -- AND I KNOW THE VENEZUELAN COMMISSION TOO -- IS MULTIPARTISAN. I KNOW IT INCLUDES REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE LIBERAL PARTY AND ITS VARIOUS FACTIONS, FROM THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY, AND ALSO FROM THE PATRIOTIC UNION. IT IS A NATIONAL, NOT PARTISAN, COMMISSION, AND THEREFORE, SINCE WE HAVE PRESENTED SOME ACHIEVEMENTS TO THE TWO COUNTRIES, I AM CONVINCED THAT THE SAME POLICY WILL CONTINUE BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN WELCOMED BY THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE AND THEIR LEADERS." FOR HIS PART, VENEZUELAN FOREIGN MINISTER REINALDO FIGUEREDO PLANCHART ASSERTED THAT THE PROBLEM OF DELIMITING SEA AND UNDERSEA AREAS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES, WHICH HAS EXISTED FOR DECADES, IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO COLOMBIA AND VENEZUELA, ALTHOUGH IT MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT OTHER VERY IMPORTANT MATTERS ARE ALSO PENDING. "THERE ARE MANY OTHER THINGS FOR WHICH THE COMMUNITIES AT THE BORDERS WANT SOLUTIONS, AND THESE ARE THE MATERS WE ARE GOING TO ATTEND TO ON A PRIORITY BASIS," HE SAID. WHEN ASKED IF THE DELIMITATION PROBLEMS WILL BE SOLVED DURING THE ADMINISTRATIONS OF PRESIDENTS VIRGILIO BARCO AND CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ , HE ASSERTED THAT "WE MUST NOT SET FIXED DEADLINES ON MATTERS." THIS WEEK LONDONO AND FIGUEREDO TOURED THE EXTENSIVE FRONTIER BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES AND DIRECTLY LEARNED ABOUT THE SITUATION AT THE COLOMBIAN-VENEZUELAN BORDER, WHERE SMUGGLING OF GOODS, DRUG TRAFFICKING, AND KIDNAPPINGS PROLIFERATE.
DEV-MUC3-1098	BOGOTA, 11 FEB 90 -- COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS SAID HE WILL ASK U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH -- DURING THE 15 FEBRUARY DRUG SUMMIT TO BE HELD IN CARTAGENA -- FOR GREATER ASSISTANCE TO BOLIVIA AND PERU, THE WORLD'S BIGGEST PRODUCERS OF COCA LEAVES. DURING AN INFORMAL TALK WITH NEWSMEN, BARCO SAID THAT AT THE SUMMIT HE WILL ASK PRESIDENT BUSH TO PROVIDE ECONOMIC AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO FIGHT THE "WAR" HE HIMSELF DECLARED ON DRUG- TRAFFICKING MAFIAS AFTER VARIOUS TERRORIST ACTIONS LAST AUGUST. ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT SPECIFY THE KIND OF AID OR HOW IT SHOULD BE PROVIDED, BARCO VARGAS SAID THE ECONOMIC MEASURES HE WILL ASK FOR WOULD CONCENTRATE ON A GREATER OPENING OF THE U.S. MARKET TO EXPORTS FROM ANDEAN COUNTRIES AFFECTED BY PRODUCTION AND CHEMICAL PROCESSING OF COCAINE. IN ADDITION TO PRESIDENTS BUSH AND BARCO, BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA AND PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA WILL ALSO ATTEND THE SUMMIT. THEY ARE EXPECTED TO PRESENT PROPOSALS ON THE SUBSTITUTION OF OTHER CROPS FOR COCA LEAVES -- THE BASE FOR MAKING COCAINE -- WHILE BEARING IN MIND THE ECONOMIC WELL-BEING AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF PEASANTS ENGAGED IN THIS ACTIVITY. THE FOUR PRESIDENTS WILL MEET FOR NO LONGER THAN FIVE HOURS AND WILL SIGN A DOCUMENT IN WHICH THEY WILL DEFINE STRATEGIES TO DEVELOP AN OVERALL STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING. ACCORDING TO UNOFFICIAL REPORTS, THE POINTS THAT WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE JOINT DOCUMENT INCLUDE STRENGTHENING ANDEAN ECONOMIES BY INCREASING EXPORTS, AND THE "TOTAL STRUGGLE" AGAINST INTERNATIONAL DRUG-TRAFFICKING GANGS BY REDUCING DEMAND, CONSUMPTION, AND SUPPLY OF HALLUCINOGENIC DRUGS. BARCO VARGAS SAID INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS SHOULD "ESPECIALLY HELP THE FRATERNAL COUNTRIES OF BOLIVIA AND PERU, WHICH HAVE GREAT NEEDS." ONE OF THE COLOMBIAN OBJECTIVES AT THE ANTIDRUG SUMMIT WILL BE TO MAKE THE UNITED STATES UNDERSTAND ITS CORESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SERIOUS COCAINE-TRAFFICKING PROBLEM BECAUSE OF ITS ALMOST 14.5 MILLION DRUG ADDICTS AND BECAUSE OF ITS SALES OF WEAPONS AND CHEMICAL COMPONENTS -- WHICH SEEM TO HAVE NO OFFICIAL CONTROL -- TO MAFIAS. AT LEAST 5,000 MEN FROM COLOMBIAN SECURITY CORPS ARE ALREADY PATROLLING STRATEGIC SITES IN CARTAGENA TO PREVENT ANY ACT OF TERRORISM THAT COULD BE PERPETRATED BY THE DRUG CARTELS DURING THE SUMMIT.
DEV-MUC3-1099	SAN SALVADOR, 10 FEB 90 -- THE DIRECTOR OF A SALVADORAN CATHOLIC CHURCH HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP HAS SAID THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ATTITUDE DOES NOT HELP ATTAIN PROGRESS IN HUMAN RIGHTS IN EL SALVADOR "BECAUSE THE ARMY IS BEING BLACKMAILED WITH MILITARY AID." "LEGAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE" DIRECTOR MARIA JULIA HERNANDEZ HAS SAID THAT FOR YEARS THE UNITED STATES HAS SUPPORTED THE THESIS THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN IMPROVEMENT IN HUMAN RIGHTS IN EL SALVADOR. DURING A MEETING WITH FOREIGN PRESS CORRESPONDENTS HERNANDEZ SAID: "THAT IS A THESIS BASED ON ITS OWN PREMISES. IT IS SELF-DECEIVING." DURING THE PAST DECADE, THE UNITED STATES HAS PROVIDED $4.5 BILLION IN ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR, WHICH ALLOWED EL SALVADOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO INCREASE ITS ARMY FROM 12,000 TO 56,000 MEN. ACCORDING TO MARIA JULIA HERNANDEZ, "THE ARMED FORCES ARE EVEN MORE ARROGANT AND HAVE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF INDISCRIMINATE ARRESTS" UNDER THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE GOVERNMENT THAT TOOK POWER LAST JUNE. SHE REPORTED THE REAPPEARANCE OF "DEATH SQUADS," AND MAINTAINED THAT THOSE GROUPS WERE ALWAYS "INVOLVED" WITH THE MILITARY. "THERE HAS NEVER BEEN OR EVER WILL BE A DEATH SQUAD TOTALLY ALIEN TO THE ARMY, BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN A POWER INDEPENDENT OF THE ARMED FORCES," HERNANDEZ SAID. ACCORDING TO LEGAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE STATISTICS CITED BY MARIA JULIA HERNANDEZ, 218 PEOPLE WERE REPORTED MISSING IN 1989, AND 31 ASSASSINATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE OF PROMINENT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, WERE BLAMED ON THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT.
DEV-MUC3-1100	CLANDESTINE, 11 FEB 90 -- TODAY, 11 FEBRUARY, AT 0900, THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE BEGAN BOMBING AND FIRING ROCKETS AGAINST A SETTLEMENT OF REPATRIATES IN HUANCORA, SAN ISIDRO LABRADOR JURISDICTION, CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT, WITH TWO A-37 PLANES AND FOUR HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS, KILLING SIX PERSONS, WOUNDING THREE OTHERS, AND DESTROYING SEVERAL HOMES. IN VIEW OF THESE ACTIONS, THE FMLN STATES: 1. WE STRONGLY CONDEMN THIS COWARDLY ATTACK, WHICH WAS CARRIED OUT PURPOSEFULLY BECAUSE THE PLACE IS COMPLETELY VISIBLE AND IDENTIFIABLE AS AN AREA POPULATED BY REPATRIATES. 2. THIS NEW CRIME DESTROYS THE VAUNTED FALSE IMAGE OF PROFESSIONALISM BY THE SALVADORAN MILITARY AND SHOWS THAT THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS A DAILY PRACTICE IN THE ARMY. 3. THIS ACTION ALSO SHOWS THE LACK OF WILL ON THE PART OF THE AIR FORCE TO ACHIEVE A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION . THE PERSISTENCE OF THESE CRIMES AGAINST DEFENSELESS PEOPLE CONFIRMS THE NEED FOR US TO REMAIN ARMED AND TO USE OUR MILITARY POWER TO ACHIEVE A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION AND PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS. WE CALL ON ALL HUMANITARIAN AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS TO PRESENT THEMSELVES AT THE PLACE TO CONFIRM THE OCCURRENCE OF THESE ACTIONS AND TO DENOUNCE THEM WITH FULL VIGOR.
DEV-MUC3-1101	SAN SALVADOR, 12 FEB 90 -- THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES DENIED TODAY THAT THEIR PLANES HAD BOMBED A REFUGEE CAMP AND CIVILIAN SETTLEMENTS IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF CHALATENANGO AND MORAZAN, LOCATED NORTH AND NORTHEAST OF SAN SALVADOR, AS RELIGIOUS SOURCES HAD REPORTED YESTERDAY. A COMMUNIQUE RELEASED BY THE ARMED FORCES STATES THAT FIVE PERSONS, INCLUDING FOUR MINORS, WERE KILLED, NOT AS A RESULT OF THE BOMBINGS, "BUT AS A RESULT OF THE CLASHES" BETWEEN SOLDIERS AND GUERRILLAS AT THE "CORRAL DE LAS PIEDRAS" REFUGEE CAMP IN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT. THE ARMED FORCES ACCUSED THE GUERRILLAS OF FIRING ROCKETS "THAT HIT SEVERAL HOUSES," AND IT REPORTED THAT A SOLDIER AND SIX GUERRILLAS WERE KILLED IN THE CLASHES, WHICH LASTED BETWEEN 0600 AND 1400. HOWEVER, EDUARDO ALAS, THE BISHOP OF CHALATENANGO, TOLD THE MEDIA TODAY THAT FIVE PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND AT LEAST 14 CIVILIANS WERE WOUNDED WHEN THE CAMP WAS ATTACKED FROM THE AIR. "ACCORDING TO THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY," ALAS SAID, "A ROCKET OR A GRENADE-TYPE DEVICE FELL ON ONE OF THE HOUSES WITH MANY PEOPLE INSIDE, INCLUDING CHILDREN. I SAW THE MUTILATED BODIES OF THE CHILDREN AND HOLES IN THE ROOF. THERE WAS A LOT OF MACHINEGUN FIRE." MOREOVER, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT CONDEMNED THE "COWARDLY ATTACK" ON THE REFUGEE HOMES, WHICH, HE SAID, WERE "HIGLY VISIBLE AND IDENTIFIED AS CIVILIAN HOUSING." "THIS INCIDENT SHOWS A TOTAL LACK OF COMMITMENT BY THE ARMED FORCES TO REACH A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION, AND IT REAFFIRMS THE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE ARMED STRUGGLE AND TO USE MILITARY POWER TO REACH A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION SO THAT HUMAN RIGHTS ARE RESPECTED," THE FMLN SAID IN A COMMUNIQUE RELEASED TODAY. THE FMLN ALSO CONDEMNED AN ALLEGED BOMBING OF THE TOWN OF CACAOPERA, IN MORAZAN DEPARTMENT, WHICH THE ARMED FORCES HAVE DENIED. ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLAS, A WOMAN WAS WOUNDED AND A SUGAR CANE HARVEST WAS DESTROYED BY THE BOMBS, BUT ACCORDING TO COL MAURICIO VARGAS, MILITARY CHIEF OF THE REGION, "THERE WAS NO BOMBING, BUT CLASHES WITH A GROUP OF GUERRILLAS WITH THE SUPPORT OF HELICOPTERS." THE MILITARY CHIEF PROMISED, HOWEVER, TO CARRY OUT THE "PERTINENT INVESTIGATIONS TO LEARN WHAT HAPPENED IN THE REGION."

A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THIS SECURITY ORGANIZATION STATES THAT, FOLLOWING AN EXHAUSTIVE INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION, IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THIS GUERRILLA MOVEMENT IS DIVIDED, BECAUSE AN ELN FACTION REFUSES TO ACCEPT THE DECISIONS OF FORMER SPANISH PRIEST MANUEL PEREZ MARTINEZ. IT ALSO STATES THAT THE DISSIDENT GROUP HAS ACCUSED THE FORMER SPANISH CLERGYMAN AND TOP ELN LEADER OF MONOPOLIZING ECONOMIC RESOURCES, PREVENTING THE MODERNIZATION OF THE RANK AND FILE, MAINTAINING A SECURITY GROUP MADE UP OF CRIMINALS, ASSUMING PATERNALISTIC ATTITUDES, AND USING THE MARXIST IDEOLOGY FOR HIS OWN BENEFIT. THE REPORT ALSO REVEALED THAT THE INSURGENT ORGANIZATION WAS PLANNING TO CARRY OUT A SO-CALLED KEY OPERATION IN NORTHERN AND EASTERN COLOMBIA THAT WOULD HAVE INCLUDED THE KIDNAPPING OF PERSONALITIES, THE OCCUPATION OF TOWNS, AND THE ASSASSINATION OF TOP ARMED FORCES OFFICERS.

"THE PARTICIPATION OF THE AIR FORCE IS EFFECTED ACCORDING TO REGULATIONS, WHICH IS WHY IT COULD NOT HAVE BOMBED CIVILIANS," VILLAMARIONA SAID. IN THE WAKE OF THIS GRAVE INCIDENT, CHALANTENANGO DIOCESE BISHOP MSGR. EDUARDO ALAS HELPED TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO THE WOUNDED AND HEARD TESTIMONIES FROM RESIDENTS.

MAZA MARQUEZ, WHO ARRIVED IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS ALONG WITH PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO -- THE HOST OF THE DRUG "SUMMIT" THAT WILL BE HELD IN THIS CITY ON COLOMBIA'S CARIBBEAN COAST -- ADDED THAT THE PARTIAL TURNOVERS THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE MADE OF RAW MATERIALS AND WEAPONS IN RECENT WEEKS "PROVE VERY LITTLE." ACCORDING TO THE COLOMBIAN GENERAL, THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS "TURN OVER ONE TON BUT THEY HIDE SEVEN TONS." THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY , THE SECRET POLICE AT THE SERVICE OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, MADE THIS STATEMENT IN REGARD TO THE VOLUNTARY TURNOVERS MADE BY THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, THE LARGEST COCAINE-EXPORTING GROUP IN THE WORLD. THE "EXTRADITABLES" BEGAN THEIR TURNOVERS DURING THE LAST WEEK OF JANUARY, AFTER ANNOUNCING THEIR SURRENDER TO THE STATE, AS PROOF OF THEIR "GOOD WILL" -- TO EARN THEM "LESS STRICT TREATMENT" BY COLOMBIAN SOCIETY. TODAY THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS "DELIVERED" THREE LABORATORIES, WITH A CAPACITY FOR PROCESSING 20,000 KG PER MONTH, TO 25 COLOMBIAN JOURNALISTS. THE FACILITIES, LOCATED IN THE CHOCO JUNGLE REGION ON THE PANAMANIAN BORDER IN NORTHERN COLOMBIA, HAVE BEEN TERMED BY THE JOURNALISTS AS "THE BIGGEST" LABS AVAILABLE TO THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS. NEVERTHELESS, THE TURNOVER WAS MINIMIZED BY THE DAS DIRECTOR, WHO SAID THAT THESE PRODUCTION CENTERS "HAVE NOT BEEN USED FOR A LONG TIME." DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE PRIOR TO THE MEETING BETWEEN THE PRESIDENTS OF BOLIVIA, COLOMBIA, THE UNITED STATES, AND PERU, MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ EMPHASIZED TODAY THAT THE COLOMBIAN STATE'S "GOAL" IS STILL "TO CAPTURE THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND TURN THEM OVER TO COLOMBIAN JUSTICE." THE CHIEF OF THE SECRET POLICE INSISTED THAT THERE IS NOTHING TO INDICATE THAT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF HOLDING A DIALOGUE OR REACHING AN AGREEMENT WITH THE NARCO-TERRORISTS.

ALTHOUGH NO ONE HAS YET CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE KIDNAPPING, IT COULD BE PART OF THE "OPERATION COLOMBIA," ANNOUNCED BY THE PRO-CASTRIST ARMY OF NATIONAL LILBERATION, CAMILIST UNION GUERRRILLA GROUP IN PROTEST FOR PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH'S VISIT TO COLOMBIA. TWO OTHER U.S. CITIZENS WERE KIDNAPPED ON 12 AND 13 FEBRUARY BY A UC-ELN "NELSON MANDELA" COMMAND GROUP IN MEDELLIN, 250 KM NORTHEAST OF BOGOTA. THEY WERE ARTHUR DONELLEY, AN INDUSTRIALIST WHO WAS RELEASED ON 13 FEBRUARY WITH A MESSAGE WHICH PROTESTED THE BUSH VISIT TO COLOMBIA, AND PROFESSOR DAVID LESLIE KENT, WHO IS STILL BEING HELD BY HIS CAPTORS. PRIEST RAFAEL LOPERA SAID THAT THE KIDNAPPED PRIEST IS A PARISH PRIEST AT THE "ANDRES SANIN" NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF CALI, A CITY LOCATED 400 KM SOUTHWEST OF BOGOTA. LOPERA ADDED THAT "THE BASILIAN COMMUNITY HAS EIGHT MEMBERS, FOUR OF WHOM ARE PRIESTS." HE REPORTED THAT AMICO DISAPPEARED THIS MORNING ON HIS WAY TO THE "SISTERS OF THERESA OF CALCUTA" NEIGHBORHOOD, WHERE HE WAS GOING TO OFFICIATE A MASS.
DEV-MUC3-1111	LONDON , 15 FEB 90 -- BRITAIN AND ARGENTINA TONIGHT AGREED TO RESUME FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WHICH WERE BROKEN OFF IN 1982 AFTER THE INVASION OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS. THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE TONIGHT IN LONDON, BUENOS AIRES AND MADRID, WHERE TWO DAYS OF TALKS BETWEEN SENIOR OFFICIALS HAVE HAMMERED OUT THE DEAL. THE FOREIGN OFFICE STRESSED THE DECISION WOULD HAVE NO EFFECT ON BRITISH SOVEREIGNTY OF THE FALKLANDS, WHERE 1,000 BRITONS WERE KILLED AND WOUNDED DURING THE WAR. BRITAIN HAS AGREED TO LIFT THE 150-MILE MILITARY PROTECTION ZONE AROUND THE FALKLANDS FROM MARCH 31. AT THE SAME TIME NEW MUTUALLY AGREED SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS WILL COME INTO FORCE. THESE WILL INVOLVE 25 DAYS ADVANCE NOTIFICATION BY EACH SIDE OF MILITARY MANOEUVRES IN CERTAIN AREAS. IT HAS ALSO BEEN AGREED THERE SHOULD BE 48-HOURS NOTICE FOR NAVAL SHIPS WHICH WANT TO APPROACH CLOSER TO THE COAST THAN 50 NAUTICAL MILES AND 70 NAUTICAL MILES FOR AIRCRAFT. FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WILL COME INTO FORCE AS SOON AS THE PROTECTING POWERS FOR THE TWO COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED. BRITAIN'S INTERESTS IN ARGENTINA HAVE BEEN REPRESENTED BY SWITZERLAND SINCE 1982. ARGENTINA'S INTERESTS IN LONDON HAVE BEEN REPRESENTED BY BRAZIL FROM THE SAME PERIOD. TALKS ON FISHERIES AROUND THE FALKLANDS WILL CONTINUE. A WORKING GROUP ON SOUTH ATLANTIC AFFAIRS IS TO BE SET UP. ITS FIRST MEETING WILL TAKE PLACE WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. AN ARGENTINE VISIT TO WAR CEMETERIES IN THE FALKLANDS WILL BE ALLOWED TO GO AHEAD. THIS WILL BE WORKED OUT THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS. BOTH SIDES HAVE ALSO AGREED THAT VISAS REQUIREMENTS WILL BE ABOLISHED. BRITAIN AND ARGENTINA HAVE ALSO AGREED TO COOPERATE ON DRUGS AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE BRITISH DELEGATION TO THE TALKS WAS LED BY SIR CRISPIN TICKELL, AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE ARGENTINE DELEGATION BY SENOR GARCIA DEL SOLAR, SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE OF PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM. THE AGREEMENT IS THE OUTCOME OF A SERIES OF CONTACTS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS. IN OCTOBER, IT WAS AGREED TO ESTABLISH CONSULAR RELATIONS. AIR LINKS BETWEEN BUENOS AIRES AND LONDON RESUMED A FEW WEEKS AGO. A PARTY OF BRITISH MPS AND PROMINENT PUBLIC FIGURES HAVE JUST RETURNED FROM BUENOS AIRES AFTER THE INAUGURAL FLIGHT BY BRITISH AIRWAYS. AN OBSTACLE TO THE RESUMPTION OF RELATIONS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WAS THE ARGENTINE REFUSAL TO DECLARE THAT HOSTILITIES BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES WERE AT AN END. HOWEVER, THE NEWLY-ELECTED ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT MADE CLEAR LAST YEAR THAT SUCH HOSTILITIES COULD NOW BE CONSIDERED AT AN END. BRITAIN, AFTER TALKS LAST OCTOBER, AGREED TO RAISE NO OBSTACLES TO ARGENTINE EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH CLOSER TRADING RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY. THE ARGENTINE ECONOMY IS NOW SEEN TO BE IN A SEVERE PLIGHT. PRESIDENT MENEM HAS WATCHED HIS POPULARITY DECLINE AS ARGENTINA INFLATION HAS REMAINED AT A HIGH LEVEL. BRITAIN AND ARGENTINA WILL ALSO ESTABLISH A DIRECT COMMUNICATION LINK BETWEEN THEIR RESPECTIVE MILITARY AUTHORITIES. THE PURPOSE IS TO REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF INCIDENTS AND TO LIMIT THEIR CONSEQUENCES IF SUCH INCIDENTS SHOULD OCCUR. ACCORDING TO THE STATEMENT, THIS HOTLINE WILL INCREASE COMMON KNOWLEDGE OF MILITARY ACTIVITIES IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC. THE LINK WILL BE UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE ARGENTINE AND BRITISH FOREIGN MINISTRIES. BRITISH MINISTERS HAVE MADE CLEAR THAT ADEQUATE DEFENCE ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR THE FALKLANDS. FOREIGN OFFICE MINISTER TIMOTHY SAINSBURY RETURNED TO LONDON LAST WEEKEND AFTER A VISIT TO THE FALKLANDS WHERE HE REASSURED ISLANDERS THERE WAS NO WEAKENING IN BRITAIN'S COMMITMENT TO THEIR DEFENCE. FOREIGN SECRETARY DOUGLAS HURD TONIGHT DESCRIBED THE AGREEMENT WITH ARGENTINA AS "VERY SATISFACTORY" AND THAT IT "UNDERLINES THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NO QUARREL WITH ARGENTINA". HE SAID: "THIS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED WITHOUT ANY SACRIFICE OF SOVEREIGNTY. I HOPE IT IS A TURNING POINT THAT WILL LEAD TO A NEW RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BRITAIN AND ARGENTINA." MR HURD TOLD REPORTERS AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE: "I HOPE THAT TRADE BETWEEN BRITAIN AND ARGENTINA CAN BE ACCELERATED. IT IS FOR THE FALKLAND ISLANDERS TO DECIDE ON THEIR OWN CONTACTS WITH THE MAINLAND." ASKED IF THE INSTABILITY IN ARGENTINA MIGHT LEAD TO A NEW ATTEMPT TO SEIZE THE FALKLANDS, HE SAID: "I THINK THAT IS BECOMING LESS AND LESS LIKELY." HE EXPRESSED APPRECIATION THAT THE READINESS OF THE GOVERNMENT IN ARGENTINA TO MAKE THIS ADVANCE WHICH BRITAIN HAD RECIPROCATED. "THE OUTCOME IS VERY SATISFACTORY," HE SAID. THE BRITISH PROTECTION ZONE HAD BEEN REPLACED "WITH SOMETHING FROM A SECURITY POINT OF VIEW THAT IS BETTER. WE HAVE REPLACED IT WITH AN ADVANCE NOTIFICATION SYSTEM ON THE APPROACH OF SHIPS AND AIRCRAFT. THAT FROM A SECURITY VIEWPOINT IS AN IMPROVEMENT." HE HOPED THAT THE AGREEMENT WOULD BE WELL RECEIVED IN THE FALKLANDS AND NOTED THAT THE FALKLAND ISLANDERS HAD ALREADY BEEN GIVEN AN ASSURANCE OF BRITAIN'S CONTINUED COMMITMENT. THE EXCHANGE OF AMBASSADORS AND THE ENDING OF VISAS WOULD TAKE PLACE QUITE SOON. ASKED IF SOVEREIGNTY OF THE FALKLANDS COULD EVER BE DISCUSSED WITH ARGENTINA HE SAID: "I DO NOT SEE HOW THAT CAN BE DISCUSSED BY US GIVEN THE HISTORY AND PRINCIPLE THAT IS INVOLVED." LABOUR WELCOMED THE MOVE TO RESUME FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. MR GEORGE FOULKES, A FRONT BENCH SPOKESMAN ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, SAID IT MEANT THE TWO COUNTRIES WERE NOW ALMOST BACK TO THEIR RESPECTIVE POSITIONS BEFORE THE 1982 CONFLICT. BUT HE ADDED: "WE MUST NOW PULL OUT ALL THE STOPS IN DEVELOPING TRADE RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES." THIS INCLUDED CONSIDERING ALL OPPORTUNITIES FOR BRITISH INVESTMENT IN ARGENTINA AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURAL, SPORTING AND OTHER LINKS.
DEV-MUC3-1112	LA PAZ, 9 FEB 90 -- THE SANTA CRUZ PREPARATORY MEETING WAS HELD UNDER STRICT SECURITY MEASURES AND ITS CONCLUSIONS HAVE BEEN KEPT UNDER STRICT SECRECY. THIS VEIL OF SECRECY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN LIFTED WHEN THE MORNING NEWSPAPER HOY PUBLISHED A LONG AGENDA UNDER THE HEADING "TOTAL WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING." THE GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, HAS NEITHER CONFIRMED NOR REJECTED THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE REPORT. . AT A MEETING AT THE INTERIOR MINISTER'S OFFICE ON 31 JANUARY, THE MINISTER TOLD COCA PRODUCERS THAT HOY DID NOT REPORT THE PRELIMINARY AGENDA... AND THAT THE PRESIDENT'S CRITERION OF "COCA IN RETURN FOR DEVELOPMENT" HAS PREVAILED. IF THIS IS THE CASE, AND IF THERE IS CONSENSUS ON THIS POSITION, WHY HASN'T THE COUNTRY BEEN INFORMED? THE SITUATION HAS BEEN FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE REMARKS BY PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA, WHO SAID THAT "WHEN EVERYTHING SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN AGREED UPON" ONE OF THE COUNTRIES INTRODUCED CHANGES THAT HAVE "CHANGED THE STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF THE ISSUE." WHAT IS THIS NEW CONCEPT? IS IT ABOUT SOVEREIGNTY OR INDEPENDENCE? THE PROGOVERNMENT PROPAGANDA HAS MONOTONOUSLY REITERATED OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS THAT TO GOVERN MEANS TO INFORM. FINE. WE AGREE THAT TO INFORM IS PART OF THE ART OF GOVERNING. TO INFORM, HOWEVER, ALSO MEANS TO TELL THE TRUTH, ESPECIALLY IF IT DEALS WITH AN ISSUE THAT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE FUTURE OF BOLIVIANS. THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE CONSISTENT, AT LEAST WITH THIS PRINCIPLE. PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA HAS REPEATEDLY PROPOSED THE REPLACEMENT OF COCA PRODUCTION THROUGH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. YET THE REMARKS BY U.S. EMBASSY DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION MARILYN MCAFEE HAVE DEALT AN ANTICIPATED BLOW THAT HAS CAUSED SOME OFFICIALS TO HESITATE. "THERE IS $15 MILLION FOR REPLACEMENT," SHE SAID. . BARELY RECUPERATED FROM HIS SURPRISE, THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT THE U.S. HELP IS A "BILATERAL ISSUE AND, CONSEQUENTLY, IT WILL NOT BE DIRECTLY ADDRESSED" AT THE CARTAGENA SUMMIT. THE INTERIOR MINISTER, WHO HAS MORE EXPERIENCE IN THIS TYPE OF SITUATION, DID NOT ATTACH MUCH IMPORTANCE TO MCAFEE'S STATEMENT AND STRESSED THAT "MORE EXACT FIGURES WILL BE MENTIONED AT THE CARTAGENA SUMMIT." WHO IS TELLING THE TRUTH? WILL THE CARTAGENA SUMMIT ADDRESS THE ECONOMIC AID? AFTER THIS PECULIAR SITUATION, THE UNITED STATES SEEMS TO HAVE CHOSEN INTERDICTION AND ERADICATION -- REPRESSION -- TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING. THE STRATEGY OF "WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING TERRORISTS" HAS PREVAILED. THIS STRATEGY LENDS ITSELF TO INTERVENTIONIST MILITARY POLICIES, SIMILAR TO THE PRESENCE OF U.S. MARINES IN BOLIVIA IN THE PAST, OR, IN THE FUTURE, THE CREATION OF A MULTINATIONAL MILITARY FORCE THAT WOULD JEOPARDIZE REGIONAL POLITICAL AND MILITARY STABILITY. WHEN THE TRAFFICKING OF COCAINE WAS CARRIED OUT AS A COVERT OPERATION INVOLVING THE CIA AND THE U.S. ARMY -- FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING MILITARY SUPPLIES TO THE CONTRAS -- COCAINE TRAFFICKING WAS NOT A CRIME. THE LINKS BETWEEN NORIEGA AND DRUG TRAFFICKING WERE A MATTER OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE AS LONG AS HE PROVIDED INFORMATION AND SUPPORT FOR THEIR WAR AGAINST NICARAGUA. BUT NOW THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT MIND INVADING PANAMA OR TURNING COLOMBIA INTO AN INFERNO TO CAPTURE NORIEGA OR SOME OF THE MAJOR COLOMBIAN TRAFFICKERS ON THIS CRUSADE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING. THAT IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S DOUBLE-FACED MORALITY. ANOTHER SCANDAL HIT U.S. SOCIETY LAST WEEK. MARION BARRY, THE MAYOR OF WASHINGTON, THE CAPITAL OF THE EMPIRE AND ALSO THE CAPITAL OF CRIME, WAS CAUGHT IN AN FBI TRAP. HE WAS FILMED CONSUMING COCAINE. HIS FOLLOWERS CLAIM THAT IT IS A WHITE CONSPIRACY TO PREVENT A BLACK MAYOR FROM RUNNING FOR ANOTHER TERM. BUT THE INTERESTING POINT FOR US IS THE CONTROVERSY BETWEEN BENNETT, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT STRATEGIST FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING , AND WASHINGTON POLICE CHIEF FULWOOD. WHILE BENNETT HAS QUESTIONED THE EFFICIENCY OF THE WASHINGTON POLICE, CLAIMING THAT THIS AREA RECEIVES THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, FULWOOD HAS SAID THAT BENNETT IS WASTING TIME "TALKING WITHOUT DOING ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING" . THE NEWSWEEK JOURNALIST SAID THAT EVEN BEFORE THE BARRY SCANDAL IT WAS POSSIBLE TO SEE THAT THE BENNETT PLAN HAD BECOME "ONLY A DIRTY BATTLE OF WORDS." BENNETT'S STRATEGY FOR THE PREVENTION AND REPRESSION OF DRUG ABUSE IN THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN A TOTAL FAILURE. BENNETT THEREFORE BELIEVES THAT THE BEST WAY TO COVER HIS FAILURE IS TO TURN TOWARD LATIN AMERICA TO RELIEVE THE FURY OF HIS IMPOTENCE, ORDERING WARSHIPS AND PLANES TO CONTROL MARITIME AND AIR TRAFFIC. AS USUAL, THOSE OF US WHO LIVE IN THE "BACKYARD" HAVE TO PAY FOR THE MISTAKES OF U.S. POLICY. THIS IS NOT A STORY OF SUSPENSE. THE SUSPENSE HAS BEEN CREATED BY THE ATTITUDE OF THE GOVERNMENT. THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO KNOW THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE SANTA CRUZ SUMMIT. OTHERWISE WE WILL HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT A SMOKE SCREEN HAS BEEN DEPLOYED OVER THE CARTAGENA SUMMIT.
DEV-MUC3-1113	NO CITY, NO DATE -- THE DEBT AND ITS INTEREST HAVE STEADILY GROWN, BUT THE VALUE OF OUR PRODUCTION HAS DECREASED, SO IT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PAY THE DEBT. THEREFORE, WE ARE FACED WITH THE SAME OLD STORY: LEND ME 100 MILLION AND I WILL PAY YOU 110 MILLION AND STILL OWE YOU 120 MILLION WITH THE NEW INTEREST. THIS ROTATION OF CREDIT DOES NOT PRODUCE ANY MATERIAL ASSETS LIKE RAW MATERIALS AND ASSEMBLY PLANTS DID IN THE PAST. CONSEQUENTLY, THIS RELATION IS NO LONGER FEASIBLE; IT IS USELESS. WE HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY POOR, AND WE OWE MORE AND MORE. WHY NOT CHANGE TO MORE RATIONAL RELATIONS LIKE IS BEING DONE BY CIVILIZED PERSONS WHO KNOW HOW TALK MULTILATERALLY? WE WOULD THUS ELIMINATE THE FOREIGN DEBT PROBLEM, WHICH NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO PAY AND, CONSEQUENTLY, NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO COLLECT. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. FINANCIAL CAPITALISM NO LONGER PRODUCES MATERIAL ASSETS AND DOES NOT GENERATE ANYTHING -- BUT IT CERTAINLY CONTINUES TO IMPOVERISH US -- SO AN ENORMOUS FINANCIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL FORCE IS ACCUMULATING IN THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE, AND JAPAN. THEY HAVE NO ONE TO SELL IT TO BECAUSE WE HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY POOR. SUDDENLY THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN EASTERN EUROPE AND THEY ARE THERE, FULL OF ILLUSIONS ABOUT CREATING NEW MARKETS IN THAT AREA -- AND THEY HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT LATIN AMERICA, WHICH PURCHASED MACHINERY FROM THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE FOR 50 YEARS. I THINK THAT IS UNJUST AND SHOULD BE DISCUSSED AS A WHOLE. THE UNITED STATES HAS... CHANGES THOUGHT WHAT MORE DOES IT WANT, IF IT HAS THE RESOURCES THAT IT NO LONGER SPENDS ON ATOMIC BOMBS OR ON MEN AND WEAPONS IN EUROPE? IT HAS TO INVEST THOSE RESOURCES SO THAT THEY MAY YIELD SOMETHING. WHERE? IN POLAND? IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA? WHY? WHY NOT IN LATIN AMERICA? WE ARE HERE AND WE HAVE COMMON PROBLEMS LIKE DRUG TRAFFICKING. THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DISCUSS. WHAT ARE PERU'S REVENUES, IN DOLLARS, FOR THE COCA CROPS? THE MOST CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE IS APPROXIMATELY $700 MILLION. WITH WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO REPLACE THAT $700 MILLION IF THE COCA CROPS ARE ABOLISHED? THAT IS THE CRUX OF THE PROBLEM AND THAT IS WHY WE CAME TO TALK. IT IS OBVIOUS, IT IS TRUE THAT I HAVE AN ETHICAL AND MORAL OBLIGATION TO END IT, BUT IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT I HAVE TO ELIMINATE THE PEASANTS' COCA CROPS TO ACHIEVE THIS. MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT ABOUT THE PEASANTS OF PERU AND BOLIVIA? COLOMBIA'S CASE IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE COCA IS PROCESSED HERE. WOULD THE PEASANTS BE WILLING TO CHANGE THOSE CROPS FOR OTHERS? IF THEY ARE GIVEN A LONG-TERM GUARANTEE, YES. BUT WOULD THEY CHANGE COCA FOR TOMATOES, ORANGES, AND CACAO? IT IS NOT EASY TO CHANGE IT FOR COFFEE, TOBACCO, CACAO, ANNATTO, OR PALM TREES. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS STUDIED ALL THIS. I HAVE A 600-PAGE REPORT FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THAT DISCUSSES THE ALTERNATIVES FOR REPLACING THE 80,000 HECTARES IN THE GUAYAGA VALLEY -- WHICH IS THE LARGEST COCA-PRODUCING AREA IN THE COUNTRY. IT WOULD COST $600 MILLION TO INDUSTRIALIZE THE AREA ON A LONG-TERM BASIS. BUT, MR. PRESIDENT, COCA PRACTICALLY GROWS WILD; IT DOES NOT REQUIRE MUCH WORK IN THE COUNTRYSIDE. HOW CAN A GOVERNMENT LIKE YOURS CONVINCE A FARMER TO INVEST MUCH MORE MONEY IN A PRODUCT THAT WOULD BE MUCH LESS PROFITABLE? LET ME ADD SOMETHING TO THAT... EXCUSE ME. IT IS A VICIOUS CIRCLE. THE PEASANT PRODUCES COCA BECAUSE HE HAS NO MONEY. I WILL NOT ASK HIM TO INVEST MONEY HE DOES NOT HAVE TO CHANGE THE PRODUCT. THE UNITED STATES HAS TO BUY THE NEW PRODUCT TO ACHIEVE THIS. THE UNITED STATES HAS TO GUARANTEE THAT IT WILL BUY THE PRODUCT. LOOK, HOW MANY TRILLIONS DOES THE UNITED STATES BUY AS IMPORTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES? A FRACTION OF THIS WOULD CHANGE THE DESTINY OF COLOMBIA, PERU, AND BOLIVIA. THE UNITED STATES SHOULD SAY: IF I BUY $600 BILLION IN PRODUCTS ABROAD, I WILL BUY $10 BILLION -- OF ANYTHING -- IN PERU, COLOMBIA, AND BOLIVIA. IT COULD BE TOMATOES, PALM OIL, COFFEE, CHOCOLATE BARS, ANYTHING. THIS WOULD CHANGE THE HISTORY OF THESE COUNTRIES.
DEV-MUC3-1114	NO CITY, NO DATE -- I HAVE SPENT THE LAST SIX YEARS OF MY POLITICAL LIFE SAYING THINGS CLEARLY. MANY PEOPLE DESCRIBE THAT ATTITUDE AS VEHEMENCE OR RADICALISM. I DISAGREE WITH THAT VIEW. WHEN THE UNITED STATES INVADED PANAMA -- AND I WAS AWARE OF WHAT NORIEGA WAS -- I SAID THAT DESPITE THAT FACT, THE INVASION HAD BEEN A CRIME. WE DEMANDED THE IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL OF THE U.S. TROOPS. I SAID THAT IF THE IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL DID NOT TAKE PLACE, I WOULD NOT ATTEND THE CARTAGENA SUMMIT, BECAUSE I COULD NOT SIT AT THE SAME TABLE WITH THE U.S. PRESIDENT WHILE A LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY REMAINED INVADED. AND IT HAPPENED. IT HAPPENED. THE TROOPS HAD TO WITHDRAW. AND WE HAVE HELD A CORDIAL MEETING FOR THAT REASON. MR PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE CONVINCED US THINGS THE WAY YOU SEE AND FEEL ABOUT THEM. WILL YOU TELL US FRANKLY -- FRANKLY -- WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF THE SUMMIT? WHAT HAPPENED AT THE SUMMIT? WHAT IMPORTANT CONCLUSIONS WERE REACHED AT THE SUMMIT? FRANKLY, AND IN A NUTSHELL, IT WAS POSITIVE. IT CREATED A MULTILATERAL ATMOSPHERE, AND WE TALKED VERY CANDIDLY. AS FOR ME PERSONALLY, I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET A CONTINENTAL POLITICIAN LIKE BUSH, AND I FOUND HIM TO BE A PRAGMATIC PERSON. I PROBABLY DISAGREE WITH HIM ON MORE THAN HALF OF THE THINGS HE THINKS, BUT I DO NOT THINK THAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE OBLIGED TO BE IDENTICAL. WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS TO LOOK AT EACH PERSON FOR HIS GOOD POINTS -- HOWEVER FEW OR MANY THEY MAY BE -- TO ESTABLISH A RAPPORT ON THAT BASIS. WHAT IS BEING PLANNED? WHAT IS NEXT? WHAT IS GOING TO BE DONE TO CONTINUE... IN ORDER FOR THE PRESIDENTS TO KEEP IN CONSTANT TOUCH TO FULFILL WHAT THEY SIGNED? WELL, THERE WILL BE CONSTANT COMMUNICATION. IT IS EASY TO TALK WITH THE U.S. PRESIDENT, WHO IS NOT GOD. THERE ARE TELEPHONES TO DO THAT. MR. BELL INVENTED A LITTLE GADGET OVER A CENTURY AGO CALLED THE TELEPHONE AND WE, THE PRESIDENTS, COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER -- WITH BARCO, PAZ ZAMORA, AND PRESIDENT BUSH, TO ASK: WILL WE OR WILL WE NOT DO WHAT WE PLEDGED TO DO? IF WE DO NOT, AT LEAST IT WILL NOT BE MY FAULT OR THAT OF THE LATIN AMERICANS. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF AN ELECTORAL PROCESS IN COLOMBIA, AND THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT IS ALSO FACING AN ELECTORAL PROCESS... AND YOU KNOW THE CANDIDATE, FORTUNATELY. MR. PRESIDENT, IT LOOKS LIKE THE OPPOSITION IS GOING TO DEFEAT YOU IN YOUR COUNTRY? IT IS A POSSIBILITY, IT IS TRUE. WHY? LOOK, ANYONE WHO LISTENS TO YOUR QUESTION WOULD THINK THAT FIVE YEARS AGO, WHEN I ASSUMED POWER, PERU WAS A COUNTRY FULL OF GOLD, VERY RICH, THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE THE SPANISH CONQUEST -- ORDERLY, AND WITHOUT PROBLEMS. FIVE YEARS AGO IT HAD A DEVELOPED TERRORIST PROBLEM. IT HAD A FOREIGN DEBT OF 14.5 BILLION AND WAS EXTREMELY POOR. FIVE YEARS HAVE ELAPSED. I EXPLAINED TO YOU ONCE THAT I TRIED TO MAKE IT GROW AT GREAT SPEED AND MANAGED TO DO SO. THEN WE FACED A DECLINE, AND WE ARE NOW STABILIZING THE SITUATION. HOWEVER, MANY PEOPLE FEEL THAT A PERSON CAN SOLVE MANY THINGS BECAUSE OF THE IMPETUOSITY IN HIS PERSONALITY. SOMETIMES THIS IS THE PROBLEM OF BEING HONEST OR HAVING AN IMPETUOUS PERSONALITY OR HARBORING MANY HOPES -- OR SELLING THEM. THE TRUTH IS THAT -- LIKE FIVE YEARS AGO -- WE HAVE A POOR COUNTRY, A COUNTRY THAT OWES MONEY, A COUNTRY THAT HAS JUST AS MUCH OR MORE SUBVERSIVE TERRORISM, AND THIS MAKES PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE. I CANNOT UNDERSTAND IT. HOWEVER, THAT IS WHAT WE POLITICIANS ARE FOR -- TO BURN OUT IN OUR WORK FOR DEMOCRACY TO SURVIVE. I WILL BE REPLACED BY SOMEONE ELSE WHO THINKS LIKE ME OR TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM ME. HE WILL REPLACE ME AND DEMOCRACY WILL STAY, A CIVILIZED SYSTEM. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.
DEV-MUC3-1115	CARTAGENA, 16 FEB 90 -- COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS HAS SAID THAT HE WILL NOT HOLD TALKS WITH NARCO-TERRORISTS BECAUSE COLOMBIAN LAW IS NOT NEGOTIABLE. BARCO MADE THAT STATEMENT FOLLOWING THE CARTAGENA SUMMIT, IN WHICH BOLIVIA, PERU, AND THE UNITED STATES ALSO PARTICIPATED. REJECTING ANY POSSIBLE TALKS ON THE SUBJECT, BARCO STRESSED: COLOMBIAN POLICY HAS NOT CHANGED -- DRUG TRAFFICKERS MUST STOP THEIR ILLEGAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, SURRENDER EVERYTHING, AND RESPECT THE LAW. PRESIDENT BARCO SAID THAT THE CARTAGENA SUMMIT CLEARS THE PATH FOR ADOPTING COMMERCIAL MEASURES TO STRENGTHEN THE ECONOMIES OF OUR COUNTRIES. HE ALSO TOLD HIS COLLEAGUES THAT, FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND BY FACING THE PROBLEM FROM ALL ITS ANGLES, THEY HAVE AGREED ON A COMMON STRATEGY FOR FUTURE ACTIONS IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.
DEV-MUC3-1116	SAN SALVADOR, 16 FEB 90 -- MILITARY AND CIVILIAN SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT EARLY THIS MORNING THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN, SET ON FIRE TWO COTTON PROCESSING PLANTS IN SAN MIGUEL, SOME 142 KM EAST OF SAN SALVADOR, CAUSING GREAT PROPERTY DAMAGE, ACCORDING TO MILITARY AND CIVILIAN SOURCES. ACCORDING TO REPORTS, FMLN MEMBERS ATTACKED THE "CANESSA" AND "EL OBRAJUELO" COTTON PLANTS IN SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT, DESTROYING HEAVY EQUIPMENT, WAREHOUSES WHERE HUNDREDS OF QUINTALES OF COTTON WERE STORED, AND THE MAIN BUILDINGS. FORTUNATELY, NO ONE WAS HURT. SPOKESMEN REPRESENTING THE OWNERS REPORTED MUCH PROPERTY DAMAGE AND NOTED THAT THE INCIDENT IS PART OF THE FMLN'S CAMPAIGN OF SABOTAGE AGAINST THE ECONOMY. HEAVY CLASHES WERE ALSO REPORTED IN MORAZAN DEPARTMENT, IN THE COUNTRY'S NORTHEASTERN REGION, DURING WHICH AT LEAST TWO SOLDIERS WERE KILLED. HOWEVER, THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE HAS NOT REPORTED THE INCIDENTS THAT OCCURRED LAST NIGHT AND EARLY THIS MORNING. SEVERAL TOWNS IN EASTERN EL SALVADOR ARE WITHOUT POWER SINCE 14 FEBRUARY DUE TO SABOTAGE ACTIONS. ELECTRICITY IS ALSO BEING RATIONED IN VARIOUS SECTORS OF SAN SALVADOR, FOLLOWING THE DESTRUCTION OF FIVE HIGH TENSION LINES, ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SOURCES. HOWEVER, BOMB ATTACKS ON SHOPPING CENTERS IN SAN SALVADOR ARE LESS FREQUENT. RECENT ATTACKS HAD CAUSED GREAT CONCERN AND PROMPTED A STRONG PROTEST FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRIES OF EL SALVADOR, WHICH DEMANDED AN END TO THE WAVE OF ATTACKS AGAINST NONMILITARY TARGETS.
DEV-MUC3-1117	SAN SALVADOR, 16 FEB 90 -- A MILITARY SOURCE HAS REPORTED THAT THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE BOMBED GUERRILLA POSITIONS ALONG THE SIDE OF SAN SALVADOR VOLCANO, APPROXIMATELY FOUR KM FROM SAN SALVADOR, THIS AFTERNOON. THE MILITARY SPOKESMAN, WHO DID NOT GIVE MANY DETAILS ABOUT THE ACTION, SAID THAT THE ARMY IS CONDUCTING A "COMBING OPERATION" IN THE AREA OF THE VOLCANO IN SEARCH OF REBEL REDOUBTS. IN EARLY JANUARY, THE ARMED FORCES BEGAN OPERATIONS "VICTORIA" AND "MARTILLO" WITH THE INTENTION OF ERADICATING FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN] POSITIONS LOCATED ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE COUNTRY'S MAJOR CITIES. THE MILITARY SOURCE DID NOT STATE WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN CASUALTIES AS A RESULT OF THE BOMBINGS.
DEV-MUC3-1118	SAN SALVADOR, 12 FEB 90 -- TERRORIST ACTIONS AGAINST SAN SALVADOR'S COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENTS CONTINUE, CREATING ALARM AND CONCERN AMONG PRIVATE ENTERPRISE GROUPS. COPREFA REPORTS TODAY THAT AT 0620 FMLN URBAN CELLS PLACED DYNAMITE STICKS IN FOUR COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENTS IN MID-TOWN SAN SALVADOR; NAMELY, A BANK, A HOTEL, A CAR DEALERSHIP, AND A STORE. THE REPORT ADDS THAT THE BANCO CUSCATLAN, LOCATED ON 6TH WEST STREET AND CUSCATLAN AVENUE; THE RITZ HOTEL, LOCATED ON 7TH SOUTH AVENUE AND RUBEN DARIO STREET; THE NASA CAR DEALERSHIP, LOCATED BETWEEN 25TH NORTH AVENUE AND 3D WEST STREET; AND THE MIKE-MIKE STORE, LOCATED ON PASAJE MONTALVO AND 1ST NORTH AVENUE, SUFFERED PARTIAL DAMAGE. THERE WERE NO VICTIMS. COPREFA ALSO REPORTS THAT 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE SOLDIERS DISCOVERED THE BODIES OF FIVE GUERRILLAS INSIDE A CACHE DURING A COMBING OPERATION CONDUCTED ON SATURDAY, 10 FEBRUARY. IT WAS ESTABLISHED THE FIVE MEN HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND AFTER THE SO-CALLED "OFFENSIVE TO THE TOP," AND PERISHED WHEN THEIR OTHER COMRADES LEFT THEM "COVERING THE WITHDRAWAL." NINE EXTREMISTS WERE KILLED THE PAST WEEKEND DURING FIGHTING WITH MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 4 IN THE CORINTO AREA, MORAZAN DEPARTMENT. IT IS SAID THE FMLN GUERRILLAS WERE TAKEN BY SURPRISE WHEN THEY TRIED TO ENTER THE TOWN. TWO SOLDIERS DIED IN THE FIGHTING. COPREFA REPORTS THAT THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE PROVIDED SUPPORT. IN ADDITION, THE COMMAND OF EL PARAISO'S 5TH BRIGADE, IN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT, REPORTS THE DEATH OF ONE OF ITS SOLDIERS DURING FIGHTING WITH SUBVERSIVE GROUPS IN THE VILLAGE OF EL ZUNGARO, IN CHALATENANGO, ON SATURDAY. IN ADDITION, THE ATONAL BATTALION STATES THAT ONE OF ITS SOLDIERS WAS KILLED IN COMBAT WITH REBELS IN THE AREA AROUND AVALOS FARM IN SANTA ELENA, USULUTAN DEPARTMENT. THIRD INFANTRY BRIGADE TROOPS REPORT SEIZING 22 AR-15 RIFLES, EIGHT M-16 RIFLES, AND FOUR FAL RIFLES, AS WELL AS TWO SOVIET-MADE AK-47 RIFLES.

THE ARSENAL WAS FOUND IN A CACHE IN LA ESCONDIDA JURISDICTION, SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT, BY TROOPS OF THE 3D BRIGADE, LEON BATTALION. THIS UNIT REPORTS A CLASH WITH THE EXTREMISTS ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN MIGUEL, DURING WHICH WAR MATERIEL WAS SEIZED.
DEV-MUC3-1119	GUATEMALA CITY, 7 FEB 90 -- DEFENSE MINISTER GEN. HECTOR ALEJANDRO GRAMAJO SPOKE ON 7 FEBRUARY AT A NEWS CONFERENCE JUST A FEW HOURS AFTER LEARNING OF A NEW GUERRILLA ATTACK THAT TOOK PLACE AT DAYBREAK ON 7 FEBRUARY, AGAINST THE TECPAN, CHIMALTENANGO POLICE GARRISON. THE GUERRILLAS STOLE FOUR .38 CALIBER REVOLVERS, FOUR M-1 CARBINES, AND .30 CALIBER AMMUNITION AND TOOK POLICE PATROL CAR NO. CH-02. DURING WEDNESDAY'S NEWS CONFERENCE, THE ARMY RELEASED A SUMMARY OF GUERRILLA ACTIVITIES STARTING IN EARLY DECEMBER, WHEN SUBVERISVE COMMANDOS DESTROYED THE BRIDGE SPANNING THE COYOLATE RIVER. DURING A FOUR-DAY PERIOD IN DECEMBER, THE GUERRILLAS SABOTAGED AN ELECTRICAL TOWER OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL AND SET FIRE TO A VEHICLE BELONGING TO THE TECHNICAL-AGRICULTURAL TRAINING INSTITUTE ON THE ROAD TO SOLOLA. TWO MORE ACTS OF SABOTAGE AGAINST ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS TOOK PLACE THE FIRST WEEK IN JANUARY. A FEW DAYS LATER, THREE GOVERNMENT-OWNED VEHICLES WERE SET ON FIRE -- ONE BELONGING TO BANDESA AND TWO BELONGING TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH MINISTRY, WHICH WERE TRANSPORTING VACCINES TO A CLINIC. DURING THE LAST DAYS OF JANUARY, THERE WAS ANOTHER ACT OF SABOTAGE AGAINST THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM IN QUEZALTENANGO AND AN ATTACK ON THE VILLAGE OF POCHUTA THAT CAUSED PERSONAL INJURIES AND PROPERTY DAMAGE. SINCE THE WEEKEND, A POST AT THE KILOMETER 42 ROAD MARK ALONG ROUTE CA-9 WAS ATTACKED AND A CIVILIAN WAS KILLED. AT DAYBREAK ON 14 FEBRUARY, THE NATIONAL POLICE GARRISON AT TECPAN, CHIMALTENANGO WAS ATTACKED, BUT NO CASUALTIES WERE REPORTED. ACCORDING TO THE MINISTER OF DEFENSE, THE LEFTIST GUERRILLAS' NEW DIRECTIVES CAME FROM A RECENT MEETING HELD IN A CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY, WHICH THE MILITARY COMMANDER DID NOT IDENTIFY. THEY ASK ME INTERNATIONALISTS. WE HAVE CONFIRMED INFORMATION THAT A MEETING WAS HELD IN ONE OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES IN OCTOBER 1989. NORTH VIETNAMESE ADVISERS -- ONE OF THEM IS NOW A VIETNAMESE GENERAL, BUT THE MEETING WAS ATTENDED BY VIETNAMESE AND CUBAN GENERALS BASICALLY -- MET WITH SUBVERSIVE LEADERS AND DISCUSSED THE STRATEGIC PLAN FOR THE CENTRAL AMERICAN AREA UNDER THE CURRENT SITUATION THEY ARE SUFFERING. THUS THEY DECIDED ON A DESPERATE PLAN WHERE THE REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLE'S WAR WAS GOING TO FOCUS ON TAKING TO ITS OWN AND ONLY COMING TO TOWNS TO MAKE ITS . EVENTUALLY, THEY WOULD GET THE POPULATION TO GO AGAINST THE STATE AND THEN TAKE OVER POWER THAT HAS BEEN ABANDONED. THIS PLAN WAS ADOPTED BECAUSE TIME IS AGAINST THEM; THE PLAN IS NO LONGER FOR A REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLE'S WAR, BUT BASED ON PURE TERRORISM BECAUSE THE INTERNATIONAL AND ALSO TO PROMOTE ACTIVITIES WITHIN GUATEMALA, MAINLY RELATED TO THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS. ACCORDING TO GEN. GRAMAJO, SOME RIVALRIES HAVE STARTED AMONG THE DIFFERENT GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY GROUPS, SUCH IS THE CASE OF THE REBEL ARMED FORCES WHO HAVE PENETRATED AREAS WERE THE REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION OF THE PEOPLE IN ARMS OPERATED, SUCH AS THE AREAS OF PACHLUM, PETEN, AND GODINEZ. ORPA NOW MAINTAINS ITSELF SOUTH OF CHIMALTENANGO, IN THE NORTHERN AREA OF ESCUINTLA AND SACATEPEQUEZ. THE POOR PEOPLE'S GUERRILLA ARMY CENTERS ITS ACTIONS AGAINST BASES. THE DEFENSE MINISTER ALSO EXPLAINED THE ARMY'S POSITION CONCERNING THE POSSIBILITY OF REINITIATING TALKS WITH GUERRILLA REPRESENTATIVES. AS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED, WE ONLY REFER TO THE THREE GROUPS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. HOWEVER, WE ARE ONLY TALKING ABOUT ARMED ACTIVITIES. THE CONSTITUTION SAYS THAT THERE CANNOT BE ARMED BANDS AND IN COMBAT ZONES. EUPHEMISMS: DIALOGUE, TALKS, AND CONFERENCES. THIS, HOWEVER, IS NOT A MATTER THAT CONCERNS US. WE HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR IN THIS SENSE. WE HAVE SERIOUS RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF A CONFERENCE, OR TALKS, OR WHATEVER THAT HAS ONLY BEEN USED AS A TACTICAL INSTRUMENT AT A SPECIFIC MOMENT. EL SALVADOR HAS SUFFERED MUCH IN THIS REGARD.
DEV-MUC3-1120	BOGOTA, 16 FEB 90 -- THE MEDIA TODAY RECEIVED AN URGENT MESSAGE WHICH WAS SIGNED BY MARTA OSPINA JARAMILLO, I.D. CARD NO. 43033612, ISSUED IN MEDELLIN, IN WHICH SHE SAYS THAT THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY HAS REQUESTED THE FORMATION OF A COMMISSION TO RECEIVE U.S. CITIZEN DAVID LESLIE KENT, WHO HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED BY THE ELN.
DEV-MUC3-1121	NO CITY, NO DATE -- PANAMA IN HIS "LIGHTING" COLUMN, LUIS ARDINES STATES THAT "I DO BELIEVE THAT THE ANTIDRUG SUMMIT IN COLOMBIA WILL YIELD VERY POSITIVE RESULTS. THE MAIN COCAINE PRODUCERS AND THE UNITED STATES, WHICH IS THE MAIN CONSUMER, WILL HAVE TO REACH AN AGREEMENT THAT WILL GIVE US HOPE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO ERRADICATE THE SCOURGE OF DRUGS, WHICH IS KILLING THE YOUTH OF THE CONTINENT." PERU PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA SAYS IN AN INTERVIEW AFTER THE SUMMIT THAT "I AM SATISFIED WITH THE CONCEPTUAL STATEMENT OF THE DECLARATION OF CARTAGENA. I HOPE IT BECOMES REALITY AND THAT THERE IS SERIOUSNESS IN THE APPROPRIATION OF RESOURCES TO REPLACE AND LIMIT DRUG TRAFFICKING." WHEN ASKED TO SUMMARIZE THE SUMMIT'S RESULTS, HE SAYS: "FRANKLY, AND IN A NUTSHELL, IT WAS POSITIVE. IT CREATED A MULTILATERAL ATMOSPHERE AND WE TALKED VERY CANDIDLY." IN CONCLUSION, HE SAYS THAT COLOMBIANS "MUST HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THAT LATIN AMERICA, TOGETHER WITH THE UNITED STATES, WILL CONFRONT THE PROBLEM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING." PERUVIAN PRESIDENT GARCIA DURING A VISIT TO SANTA MARTA, COLOMBIA TO PAY TRIBUTE TO LIBERATOR SIMON BOLIVAR, SAYS THAT THE MEETING IN CARTAGENA "OPENS DOORS TO MULTILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS INSTEAD OF THE BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS THAT THE POWERFUL UTILIZED TO DIVIDE LATIN AMERICA." VENEZUELA VENEZUELAN TELEVISION CARRIES A VIDEO REPORT REVIEWING THE SUMMIT AND ITS RESULTS, HIGHLIGHTING THAT IT ENDED "WITH A POSITIVE RESULT," NAMELY "THE JOINT DECLARATION SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENTS" TO "FIGHT TOGETHER THE DRUG TRAFFICKING TRADE" AND THE UNITED STATES' PLEDGE TO "PROVIDE FINANCIAL AID TO REPLACE THE COCA CROPS." THE VIDEO REPORT ALSO FEATURES SELECTED EXCERPTS OF THE STATEMENTS GIVEN BY THE FOUR PRESIDENTS. VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ MET WITH FORMER ARGENTINE PRESIDENT RAUL ALFONSIN AND FORMER COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT BELISARIO BETANCUR IN CARACAS TO ANALYZE THE CARTAGENA DRUG SUMMIT'S RESULTS. BETANCUR EMPHASIZED THAT "THE UNITED STATES SELLS THE CHEMICAL COMPONENTS NEEDED TO PROCESS" THE COCAINE, NOT TO MENTION THAT THIS COUNTRY "IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DRUG CONSUMER" IN THE WORLD. COLOMBIA FORMER COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT BELISATIO BETANCUR PARTICIPATED IN A LATIN AMERICAN DEMOCRATIZATION SYMPOSIUM HELD IN CARACAS AND TERMED AS "POSITIVE" THE CARTAGENA DRUG SUMMIT, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE "IT RESULTED IN SPECIFIC CONCLUSIONS" WHICH "HAVE FILLED OUR COUNTRIES WITH HOPE." DIEGO GARCIA, PRESIDENT OF THE ANDEAN LAWYERS COMMISSION, TERMED THE CARTAGENA SUMMIT AS "RHETORICAL AND INSUFFICIENT BECAUSE IT WAS CENTERED ON REPRESSION RATHER THAN STRUCTURAL CHANGES," ADDING THAT THE AMOUNT PLEDGED BY THE UNITED STATES FOR THE ANTI-DRUG STRUGGLE WAS "VERY LITTLE." GARCIA ADDED THAT "THE IDEA IS NOT FOR DEVELOPED COUNTRIES TO GIVE MONEY" TO LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS, BECAUSE THE IDEAL THING WOULD BE TO "ESTABLISH DIFFERENT ECONOMIC RELATIONS, REDUCE TAXES, GIVE PREFERENCE" TO LATIN AMERICAN PRODUCTS, AND "DEFINE THE QUOTA SYSTEM."
DEV-MUC3-1122	BOGOTA, 17 FEB 90 -- OFFICIAL SPOKESMEN REPORTED HERE TODAY THAT THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT AND M-19 WILL SIGN A FINAL PEACE AGREEMENT ON 19 FEBRUARY. THE SOURCES ADDED THAT, THIS WEEKEND, INTERIOR MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS AND M-19 LEADER CARLOS PIZARRO WILL AGREE ON THE TIME FOR THE CEREMONY, WHICH WILL BE HELD AT THE NATIONAL CAPITOL. THE SIGNING OF THE AGREEMENT--WHICH INVOLVES THE DEMOBILIZATION OF M-19, THE DELIVERY OF ITS WEAPONS TO A COMMISSION FROM THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL, AND THE REINCORPORATION OF ITS MEMBERS INTO CIVILIAN LIFE--HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY POSTPONED. GOVERNMENT SPOKESMEN ADDED THAT AFTER THE SIGNING OF THE DOCUMENT, PIZARRO AND HIS DEPUTY AND IDEOLOGIST ANTONIO NAVARRO WILL HOLD A NEWS CONFERENCE TO EXPLAIN THE PROGRAM THAT THE ORGANIZATION, WHICH IS IN THE PROCESS OF BECOMING LEGAL, WILL CARRY OUT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE 11 MARCH LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS. IN SOME AREAS OF THE COUNTRY, M-19 WILL PRESENT ITS OWN LIST OF CANDIDATES, WHILE IN OTHERS IT WILL PARTICIPATE IN COALITION WITH TRADITIONAL PARTIES AND LEFTIST GROUPS. THE PEACE TALKS, RECENTLY SEALED WITH AN AMNESTY FOR THE SUBVERSIVES, BEGAN BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO AND M-19, AN EXTREME LEFTIST AND NATIONALIST GROUP STRUGGLING FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS, IN EARLY 1989. THE M-19 OCCUPIED THE DOMINICAN EMBASSY IN BOGOTA FOR TWO MONTHS. THE GROUP HELD APPROXIMATELY 20 FOREIGN DIPLOMATS HOSTAGES. IN ADDITION, THE M-19 STOLE 5,000 WEAPONS FROM A MILITARY GARRISON AND CARRIED OUT THE BLOODY TAKEOVER OF BOGOTA'S JUSTICE PALACE, AN ACTION THAT CLAIMED THE LIVES OF 100 PEOPLE.
DEV-MUC3-1123	SAN SALVADOR, 18 FEB 90 -- SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI TODAY SAID THE GOVERNMENT IS AWAITING A REPLY FROM THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT REGARDING A POSSIBLE RESUMPTION OF THE DIALOGUE. CRISTIANI HELD A NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE COMALAPA AIRPORT THIS MORNING PRIOR TO TRAVELING TO TAIWAN ON A TOUR WHICH, HE SAID, WILL LAST UNTIL 3 MARCH. CRISTIANI DISCLOSED THAT AS PART OF HIS MEDIATION EFFORTS, THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL HAS TWICE SENT HIS PERSONAL DELEGATE, ALVARO DE SOTO, WHO HAS BEEN TOLD THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DEMANDS THAT THE FMLN HALT ITS HOSTILITIES AND SABOTAGE ACTIVITY AIMED AT DISRUPTING NATIONAL COMMERCE. "WE KNOW," PRESIDENT CRISTIANI SAID, "THAT THE FMLN HAS ASKED FOR TWO WEEKS TO STUDY AND RESPOND TO OUR LATEST PROPOSAL." THE PRESIDENT REFERRED TO AN ATTACK LAST NIGHT AND EARLY THIS MORNING ON AN ELECTRIC POWER SUBSTATION IN NORTHWESTERN SAN SALVADOR, DESCRIBING IT AS "A PUBLICITY PLOY TO IMPRESS THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL." "WE ARE INSISTING ON A HALT TO HOSTILITIES" BECAUSE OF SUCH ACTIONS, WHICH "CONSTITUTE ONLY TERRORISM AND DO NOT REPRESENT A MILITARY THREAT," THE PRESIDENT SAID. THE PRESIDENT DENIED THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING FOR ECONOMIC AID IN OTHER REGIONS BECAUSE OF THE SUSPENSION OF FRG AID AND BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF U.S. AID CUTS. "THIS VISIT TO TAIWAN HAD BEEN SCHEDULED SINCE BEFORE THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE IN NOVEMBER. I RECEIVED THE INVITATION FROM THE TAIWAN GOVERNMENT WHEN I TOOK OFFICE IN JUNE," CRISTIANI SAID. HE ADDED THAT THE OBJECTIVE OF THE VISIT IS TO STRENGTHEN RELATIONS AND TRADE WITH A FRIENDLY GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS TO EXPRESS THANKS FOR THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TAIWAN HAS PROVIDED. REGARDING AID FROM THE FRG, HE SAID "EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO REESTABLISH IT. THE FRG GOVERNMENT IS CONDITIONING ITS AID ON RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THE COUNTRY." REFERRING TO U.S. AID, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT SAID HE IS NOT AWARE THAT OFFICIAL DECISIONS OR PLANS EXIST. INSTEAD, THERE ARE PERSONAL POSITIONS OF CONGRESSMEN OR SPECIAL-INTEREST GROUPS, BUT THIS MUST BE FULLY DISCUSSED AT THE TIME OF THE VOTE FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR, WHICH IN THE UNITED STATES BEGINS IN OCTOBER. THE PRESIDENT ALSO DEFENDED THE RECENT ECONOMIC MEASURES, WHICH HAVE LED TO PROTESTS AGAINST THE GENERAL INCREASE IN PRICES OF STAPLES. HE SAID THESE MEASURES WERE NECESSARY FOR THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY, WHICH WAS AFFECTED LAST YEAR, FIRST, BY THE OVERALL CUTS IN U.S. AID TO THE REGION, A REDUCTION OF $55 MILLION FOR EL SALVADOR; SECOND, BY THE DROP IN INTERNATIONAL COFFEE PRICES, WHICH CAUSED $150 MILLION IN LOSSES FOR EL SALVADOR; AND THIRD, BY THE DAMAGE FROM THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE IN NOVEMBER. BEFORE LEAVING ON HIS TRIP AND IN RESPONSE TO NEWSMEN'S QUESTIONS, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ALSO DEFENDED THE ARMED FORCES, STATING THAT THE ACTIONS IN WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED RECENTLY HAVE NOT WEAKENED THEM AND, ON THE CONTRARY, HAVE STRENGTHENED THE ARMED FORCES BECAUSE ERRORS HAVE BEEN ADMITTED AND THOSE RESPONSIBLE ARE BEING PROSECUTED, SUCH AS IN THE CASES OF THE JESUITS AND THE CIVILIANS WHO WERE KILLED ON 11 FEBRUARY IN CHALATENANGO. CRISTIANI SAID THAT IN THE LATTER CASE THERE HAVE BEEN NO PRESSURES AND THAT FROM THE MOMENT THAT THERE WAS NEWS ABOUT THE TRAGEDY, THE COMMISSION THAT INVESTIGATES CRIMINAL ACTS WAS ORDERED TO UNDERTAKE THE APPROPRIATE INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE TRAGEDY. HE SAID IT CONCLUDED THAT THE TRAGEDY WAS CAUSED BY A HELICOPTER ROCKET, BUT THERE WAS NO BOMBING, ALTHOUGH THE CIVILIANS WERE VICTIMS OF WAR ACTIONS. CRISTIANI CRITICIZED THE FMLN FOR WAGING BATTLES IN POPULATED AREAS BECAUSE THIS ENDANGERS CIVILIANS. IN CONCLUSION, CRISTIANI SAID THE FMLN WILL NEVER GIVE UP ITS ATTEMPTS TO WEAKEN OR DIVIDE THE ARMED FORCES, BUT HE ADDED THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE BECOMING MORE PROFESSIONAL EVERY DAY.
DEV-MUC3-1124	BOGOTA, 18 FEB 90 -- THE COMMUNIST REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA'S GENERAL STAFF STATED THAT ALL THE COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA MOVEMENTS AGREE THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH SHOULD SERVE AS MEDIATOR IN A BROAD PEACE PROCESS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS. THE FARC'S STATEMENTS ARE CONTAINED IN A LETTER RELEASED TODAY THAT WAS SENT TO CARDINAL ALFONSO LOPEZ TRUJILLO, PRESIDENT OF THE EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE, IN WHICH THE GUERRILLAS RESPOND TO RECENT STATEMENTS BY THE PRELATE, INTERPRETED BY THE FARC AS A MEDIATION OFFER. ALTHOUGH THE DECLARATION IS ONLY SIGNED BY THE FARC COMMANDERS, IN CERTAIN PARAGRAPHS THEY EXPRESS THEMSELVES AS IF THEY WERE SPEAKING FOR THE SIMON BOLIVAR GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD, FOUNDED IN SEPTEMBER 1987. IN ADDITION TO THE FARC, THE SIMON BOLIVAR GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD IS MADE UP OF THE PRO-MAO POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY , THE PRO-CASTRO CAMILISTA UNION OF NATIONAL LIBERATION , THE PRO-TROTSKY REVOLUTIONARY WORKERS' PARTY , AND THE INDIAN GROUP QUINTIN LAME. THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT , WHICH HAS A LEFTIST - NATIONALIST ORIENTATION AND WHICH WAS PART OF THE SIMON BOLIVAR GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD, BEGAN 16 MONTHS AGO, OF ITS OWN ACCORD, A PEACE PROCESS WITH VIRGILIO BARCO'S LIBERAL PARTY GOVERNMENT. THIS PEACE PLAN, WHICH HAS STUMBLED ACROSS SEVERAL POLITICAL OBSTACLES THAT HAS PRECLUDED TOTAL COMPLIANCE, COULD END ON 28 FEBRUARY WITH THE M-19 HANDING OVER THEIR WEAPONS TO A SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION, THE FINAL PHASE BEING POSTPONED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS SINCE LAST DECEMBER. "YOUR RECENT STATEMENTS, CARDINAL, ON OPENING NEW ROADS TOWARD PEACE SEEM IMPORTANT TO US," THE FARC COMMANDERS STATE IN THEIR LETTER TO CARDINAL LOPEZ TRUJILLO. "YOUR EMINENCE SAYS THAT IT WOULD MEAN GREAT PROGRESS FOR THE COUNTRY IF THE FARC WERE TO TAKE PART IN A COHERENT PEACE PROCESS," THE NOTE GOES ON, ADDING: "YOUR EMINENCE SHOULD KNOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS EFFORT EVER SINCE BELISARIO BETANCUR'S AMNESTY, WHICH STOPPED A 25-YEAR WAR." IN 1984, UNDER BELISARIO BETANCUR'S SOCIAL - CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT , A PEACE PROCESS BEGAN THAT RESULTED IN THE CREATION OF THE LEGAL LEFT-WING PATRIOTIC UNION MOVEMENT -- INITIALLY COMPRISED OF FORMER FARC GUERRILLAS -- AND AN AGREEMENT RENDERING THE GUERRILLA GROUP'S GENERAL STAFF CAMP INVIOLABLE. THE FARC LEADERS SAY IN THEIR LETTER TO THE CARDINAL THAT THE BARCO GOVERNMENT "DID NOT WANT OR COULD NOT CONTINUE BETANCUR'S POLICY OF PEACE AND RECONCILIATION." "IF THE COLOMBIAN CHURCH, JUDGING BY THE CARDINAL'S STATEMENTS, SERVES AS AN ITERMEDIARY BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS, WE APPLAUD THAT HUMANISTIC AND PATRIOTIC DECISION," THE FARC GENERAL STAFF'S LETTER SAYS. THE GUERRILLA GROUP ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE YESTERDAY PROPOSING THAT THE BARCO GOVERNMENT DECLARE A GENERAL CEASE-FIRE FOR THE 11 MARCH LEGISLATIVE AND 27 MAY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, TO WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT YET RESPONDED. HOWEVER, WITH PREVIOUS REQUESTS, THE GOVERNMENT HAS LIMITED ITSELF TO ASKING THE GUERRILLAS FOR UNILATERAL TRUCES TO PROVE THEIR DESIRE FOR PEACE, WHICH HAS ONLY WORKED OUT IN THE CASE OF THE M-19. ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE SIMON BOLIVAR GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE UC-ELN, DECLARED UNILATERAL TRUCES DURING THE LAST FEW WEEKS. THE PRO-CASTRO GROUP IS THE ONLY ONE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE A SABOTAGE CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE ELECTIONS, CHARACTERIZED BY KIDNAPPINGS, ATTACKS ON RURAL VILLAGES, THREATS TO OFFICIALS, AND POLICE AND ARMY AMBUSHES.
DEV-MUC3-1125	LIMA, 18 FEB 90 -- PERU HAS FACED THE GREAT ADVERSITY OF FOREIGN IMPERIALISM. PERU, A POOR AND WEAK BUT SOVEREIGN COUNTRY, HAS RAISED ITS VOICE TO FACE THE POWER AND GREED OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANKING SECTORS. PERU AND THE PERUVIAN STATE HAVE REFUSED TO PAY AN UNJUST DEBT. THIS WILL BE FOREVER REGARDED AS THE PIONEER AND VANGUARD ATTITUDE OF THE THIRD WORLD. NO ONE WILL EVER FORGET THAT, IN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF MY ADMINISTRATION, THE PERUVIAN RESOURCES THAT WERE SCHEDULED TO BE USED TO PAY THE FOREIGN DEBT WERE INSTEAD USED FOR THE BENEFIT OF PERU. ALL PERUVIANS ADMITTED AT THE TIME THAT WE HAD BEGUN A PROCESS OF CAPITALIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT. I HAVE COME HERE TODAY TO DELIVER SOME TRACTORS. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT DURING THE APRA ADMINISTRATION THE NUMBER OF TRACTORS HAS DOUBLED. WHEN THE APRA ASSUMED POWER IN 1985, THERE WERE 5,060 TRACTORS IN PERU. BUT AFTER I DELIVER THESE ITALIAN TRACTORS, THERE WILL BE 11,200. THIS MEANS THAT THE AMOUNT OF LAND BEING FARMED MECHANICALLY IN PERU HAS DOUBLED. APPLAUSE, CHEERS OF "ALAN, ALAN" THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT HAS BEEN INVESTED IN EQUIPMENT OPERATING IN PERU TODAY IS THE SAME MONEY THAT, IN A SOVEREIGN DECISION, THE FATHERLAND REFUSED TO SEND ABROAD TO FOREIGN INTERNATIONAL BANKS. SHOUTS OF "WELL DONE" THE ANTI-IMPERIALISTIC IDEAL THAT WE UPHOLD IS BASED ON THIS MAIN PRINCIPLE: TO RETAIN OUR RESOURCES WITHIN PERU. WE HAVE ALSO RAISED OUR VOICES TO DEFEND THE SOVEREIGNTY AND INTEGRITY OF OUR CONTINENT, BECAUSE WE ARE A PROUD AND FREE CONTINENT. WHEN WE SAW MILITARISTIC IMPERIALISM THREATEN AND INVADE A BROTHER COUNTRY, WE HAD THE HONOR -- THE SAD HONOR -- OF BEING THE ONLY ONE TO RAISE ITS VOICE AND TO MAKE IMPERIALISM, DUE TO THE FIRMNESS OF THE PERUVIAN STANCE, HEED OUR DEMANDS AND WITHDRAW ITS INVADING TROOPS FROM PANAMA." I REMEMBER THE NIGHT OF 20 DECEMBER 1989, WHEN AT 0500 GMT I WAS INFORMED FROM WASHINGTON THAT 24,000 AMERICAN SOLDIERS HAD OCCUPIED PANAMA. I RECEIVED MANY PHONE CALLS FROM PEOPLE WHO TOLD ME: IT IS A DONE DEED. LET THEM INVADE THE COUNTRY. WE DO NOT NEED TO CONFRONT THEM. I RECEIVED PHONE CALLS FROM PEOPLE IN PERU AND ABROAD TELLING ME THAT WE COULD NOT CONFRONT THEM, THAT WE COULD NOT MAKE ANY DEMANDS. THEY SAID FOR US TO ACT AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED. LET US RECOGNIZE THE GOVERNMENT THAT THEY HAVE PUT IN POWER. BUT I SAID NO. PEOPLE SHOUT "WELL DONE" I WAS TOLD: IF YOU KEEP SILENT, YOU CAN SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM WITH THE IMF. BUT I SAID NO, BECAUSE THE DIGNITY OF A NATION IS NOT FOR SALE. NO, BECAUSE THE DIGNITY OF LATIN AMERICA CANNOT BE BOUGHT. APPLAUSE, CHEERS OF "ALAN, ALAN" CAUSING FEAR AND ASTONISHMENT FOR MANY PEOPLE IN PERU AND THROUGHOUT LATIN AMERICA, I SAID: WE ARE POOR. WE HAVE NO GREAT MILITARY POWER. WE HAVE NO PLANES OR BOMBS. WE HAVE NO BANKS FILLED WITH MILLIONS. BUT WE HAVE THE POWER OF REASON, WHICH IS MORE POWERFUL. WE HAVE THE POWER OF JUSTICE, WHICH IS GREATER. WE HAVE THE POWER OF FREEDOM, WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT. I SAID THAT WE WOULD RECALL THE PERUVIAN AMBASSADOR FROM WASHINGTON. WE WOULD WITHDRAW FROM THE MILITARY ALLIANCE THAT WE HAVE WITH THE UNITED STATES, WHICH ALLOWED IT TO PERPETRATE THIS INVASION. WE WOULD TELL THE UNITED STATES THAT UNTIL THE LAST SOLDIER WAS WITHDRAWN, WE WOULD NOT SIT AT ANY NEGOTIATING TABLE, NOT ON DRUGS OR ON ANY OTHER SUBJECT. BUT THE PERUVIAN RIGHTIST SECTORS DESCRIBED EVERYTHING I SAID ON 21 DECEMBER, EIGHT HOURS AFTER THE PANAMANIAN INVASION, AS INSANE. THEY DESCRIBED IT AS DEMAGOGIC THEATRICS. THEY SAID WE SHOULD COMPLY WITH THE U.S. ACTIONS. BUT I SAID NO. ALTHOUGH WE RESPECT THE UNITED STATES AND ITS PEOPLE, WE DO NOT TOLERATE IMPERIALISTIC IMPOSITIONS. WE DO NOT TOLERATE OTHER COUNTRIES INTERVENING IN THE SOVEREIGN AFFAIRS OF SISTER-NATIONS. I CAN STATE WITH GREAT SATISFACTION THAT, 24 HOURS BEFORE THE CARTAGENA SUMMIT AND 2 MONTHS AFTER THE INVASION, THE LAST U.S. SOLDIER WITHDREW FROM PANAMA. THIS WAS THE SINE QUA NON CONDITION FOR MY ATTENDANCE AT THE SUMMIT. APPLAUSE, CHEERS THIS PROVES THAT YOU CAN BE POOR AND ECONOMICALLY WEAK, BUT THAT YOU CAN HAVE THE STRENGTH THAT COMES FROM REASON, FROM MORAL PRINCIPLES; THAT YOU CAN HAVE JUSTICE ON YOUR SIDE; THAT YOU CAN SUCCEED, THAT SOONER OR LATER YOU WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. PERHAPS JUSTICE MAY COME LATE, BUT IT COMES. WHEN I SEE THE OLIGARCHIC ATTACK OF THE PREPOTENT ECONOMIC POWER HITTING PERU, I TELL THE PEOPLE THAT THE RIGHTIST SECTORS MAY BE VICTORIOUS. BUT IT WILL BE AN EPHEMERAL, TEMPORARY, AND MOMENTARY VICTORY BECAUSE IT IS THE PEOPLE WHO WILL SUCCEED, THE PEOPLE WHO WILL CONQUER, BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ARE RIGHT, THE PEOPLE HAVE JUSTICE ON THEIR SIDE, AND BECAUSE PERU BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE. APPLAUSE, CHEERS
DEV-MUC3-1126	SAN SALVADOR, 18 FEB 90 -- SAN SALVADOR ARCHBISHOP ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS DEPLORED YESTERDAY THE ECONOMIC MEASURES THAT THE GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED RECENTLY "BECAUSE THEY WILL AFFECT POOR SECTORS ONLY," AND INSISTED ON THE NEED TO END THE WAR. RECALLING FROM THE CATHEDRAL'S PULPIT THE PROMISE PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI MADE IN HIS INAUGURAL SPEECH THAT HE WOULD "STRUGGLE FOR THE POOREST OF THE POOR," MONSIGNOR RIVERA Y DAMAS SAID THE MECHANISMS USED BY THE GOVERNMENT ARE NOT THE MOST ADEQUATE ONES TO RESOLVE THE SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN EL SALVADOR. "IF WE WANT TO HELP THE POOREST AMONG THE POOR, WE MUST NOT ONLY HONESTLY AND OBJECTIVELY EXAMINE THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT MODEL, BUT SEEK A DEFINITIVE SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM OF WAR," THE PRELATE EXCLAIMED. THE HIGHEST REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN EL SALVADOR SAID THAT, IN EXAMINING THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC SITUATION, "THE TERRORIST ACTIONS PERPETRATED BY THE GUERRILLAS CANNOT BE IGNORED." RIVERA Y DAMAS WARNED: "IF WAR CONTINUES TO BE WAGED IN THE COUNTRY, IT WILL CONTINUE TO STRIKE AT US MERCILESSLY AND INHUMANLY, HOUR AFTER HOUR." THE SALVADORAN ARCHBISHOP REITERATED THAT THE "ONLY WAY OUT" OF THE ARMED CONFLICT IS DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION, BECAUSE "VIOLENCE BEGETS ONLY VIOLENCE." HE ALSO SAID: "THE BLOOD SHED IN THE WEE HOURS OF 16 NOVEMBER BY THE JESUIT CHURCHMEN WHO WERE BRUTALLY MOWED DOWN IS WORKING FOR THE POOR MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN THEIR ACADEMIC AND THEOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES SERVING THE PEOPLE'S EDUCATION." HE WAS REFERRING TO THE MASSACRE OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS WHO WERE KILLED BY MILITARY MEN, NOW UNDER TRIAL.
DEV-MUC3-1127	CALI, 20 FEB 90 -- THE CALI POLICE HAVE CONFIRMED THAT U.S. PRIEST FRANCISCO ANTONIO AMICO FERRARI, WHO HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED BY AN ELN CELL, WAS RELEASED IN NORTHERN CALI ON 19 FEBRUARY. PRIEST AMICO FERRARI, WHO HAS BEEN WORKING IN THE ANDRES SANIM NEIGHBORHOOD IN NORTHEASTERN CALI FOR 3 YEARS, SHOWED UP AT HIS PARISH, THE NUESTRA SENORA DE LA ASUNCION CHURCH, AT THE END OF THE 1930 MASS LAST NIGHT. ALTHOUGH VISIBLY TIRED, AMICO FERRARI WAS HAPPY AT HAVING BEEN FREED. THE PRIEST SAID THAT HE WAS TREATED WELL AND THAT HE HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED BY AN ELN CELL IN PROTEST OF U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH'S RECENT VISIT TO CARTAGENA.
DEV-MUC3-1128	BOGOTA, 20 FEB 90 -- AS A RESULT OF AN OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY ELN , EPL , AND FARC REBELS, FIVE PEASANTS AND FOUR GUERRILLAS HAVE DIED, FIVE POLICEMEN HAVE BEEN WOUNDED, AND PROPERTY LOSSES IN THE MILLIONS HAVE OCCURRED. THE REBEL ACTIONS TOOK PLACE IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF BOLIVAR, META, SANTANDER, NORTHERN SANTANDER, CORDOBA, ANTIOQUIA, AND IN THE ARAUCA INTENDANCY. ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES' PRELIMINARY REPORT, ELN GUERRILLAS APPARENTLY BLEW UP A POWER TOWER IN CARTAGENA CAUSING A BLACKOUT IN MOST PARTS OF CARTAGENA CITY. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE ELN REBELS SHOT AT THREE EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE CENTERS WOUNDING FIVE POLICEMEN. SIMILARLY, TWO BOMB ATTACKS ON THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS AND CENTRAL DE LOS LLANOS ORIENTALES OIL PIPELINES CONDUCTED BY ELN REBELS HAVE RESULTED IN PROPERTY DAMAGE IN THE MILLIONS. THE TWO ATTACKS OCCURRED IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF NORTHERN SANTANDER AND META, RESPECTIVELY. TWO REBELS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND FOUR OTHERS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AFTER VARIOUS CLASHES BETWEEN COLOMBIAN ARMY TROOPS AND ELN AND FARC REBELS IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF SANTANDER, META, AND ARAUCA INTENDANCY. IN ADDITION, TWO EPL REBELS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN A RURAL AREA IN CORDOBA DEPARTMENT IN CLASHES WITH A CARTAGENA BATTALION MILITARY PATROL. THE MILITARY PATROL WAS CONDUCTING SEARCH AND COMBING OPERATIONS IN THE AREA. ONE SOLDIER WAS ALSO WOUNDED IN THE CLASHES. SIMILARLY, THREE PEASANTS HAVE BEEN SHOT TO DEATH BY ALLEGED EPL MEMBERS IN A RURAL AREA OF TIERRA ALTA MUNICIPALITY, CORDOBA DEPARTMENT. MEANWHILE, TWO OTHER PEASANTS, WHO WERE ACCUSED OF HELPING THE POLICE, HAVE BEEN SHOT TO DEATH BY ALLEGED ELN MEMBERS IN BARBACOAS, YONDO MUNICIPALITY, ANTIOQUIAN MIDDLE MAGDALENA. FINALLY, ELN GUERRILLAS BLEW UP A PRIVATE PLANE CAUSING PROPERTY DAMAGE IN THE MILLIONS IN NUEVA FLORIDA, MIRAFLORES MUNICIPALITY, BOLIVAR DEPARTMENT.
DEV-MUC3-1129	SANTIAGO, 5 FEB 90 -- ON THE EVENING OF 20 MAY 1986, THE JENKA, A DANISH CARGO SHIP WITH AN EMPTY HOLD, WAS ANCHORED IN VALPARAISO BAY. THE SHIP, WHICH WAS SPECIALLY FITTED TO CARRY WEAPONS, HAD BEEN "WAITING INTO LINE" FOR 120 DAYS, MEANING -- IN PORT OPERATION JARGON -- THAT IT WAS WAITING FOR ITS TURN OR FOR THE ARRIVAL OF ITS CARGO. THE FIVE-MAN CREW WAS UNEASY. THEY WERE WAITING FOR A SHIPMENT OF 400 "WASP" CLUSTER BOMBS PRODUCED BY FERRIMAR -- A SUBSIDIARY OF FAMAE -- AND BOUND FOR THE MIDDLE EAST. THE DESTINATION OF THE SHIPMENT WAS IRAN. THE USERS: THE ARMED FORCES OF IMAM RUHOLLAH KHOMEINI. THE SECRET SHIPMENT WAS HAVING PROBLEMS ON LAND. THE FIVE CREW MEMBERS MADE A DECISION THAT NIGHT, TAKING ON FUEL AND FOOD AND FLEEING TOWARD PANAMA. IN THE DARK NO ONE NOTICED THE SHIP'S DEPARTURE, NOT THE SHIPPING COMPANY THAT WAS IN CHARGE OF THE SHIP NOR THE PORT'S CAPTAIN -- A NAVY OFFICER WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO AUTHORIZE THE MOVE. THE JENKA LEFT AN UNPAID DEBT OF $30,000 OWED TO THE SHIPPING COMPANY. THE CASE WAS REPORTED BY THE PRESS AND FERRIMAR RUSHED TO SAY THAT IT WAS SELLING WEAPONS TO PAKISTAN AND NIGERIA. IT WAS ALSO SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT, FOR ETHICAL REASONS, WOULD NOT ALLOW THE ENTERPRISE TO OFFER THE "WASP" BOMBS TO IRAN. IN FACT, CHILEAN BUSINESSMAN CARLOS CARDOEN WAS ALREADY SELLING "CLUSTERS" TO IRAQ. DOING BUSINESS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE TWO SIDES CONFRONTING EACH OTHER IN THE LONG PERSIAN GULF WAR WAS NOT CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE. THE DEAL, HOWEVER, WAS ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE THERE COULD BE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROFITS. COUNTRIES LIKE BRAZIL AND THE USSR WERE KNOWN TO BE SELLING WEAPONS TO BOTH IRAN AND IRAQ. THE USSR WAS DIRECTLY SELLING WEAPONS TO IRAQ AND SUPPLYING IRAN THROUGH MIDDLEMEN. CHILE KNEW OF A SIMILAR EXAMPLE: DURING THE BEAGLE CHANNEL CONFLICT, WHICH ALMOST ENDED IN A WAR WITH ARGENTINA, ISRAEL SOLD MISSILES TO BOTH SIDES. THEREFORE, IN A CAREFULLY PLANNED OPERATION, FERRIMAR AND FAMAE WERE ABLE TO SELL CLUSTER BOMBS TO IRAN. THE MIDDLEMAN WOULD BE FRENCHMAN BERNARD STROIAZZO, THE SAME PERSON WHO THREE YEARS LATER WOULD CAUSE THE "IRAN-CORFO" SCANDAL . IT IS ONLY NOW THAT STROIAZZO'S HISTORY HAS BEEN MADE PUBLIC. AN ENGINEER HIRED BY IRAN'S NATIONAL PETROLEUM COMPANY, HE SERVED AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF FERRIMAR AND FAMAE TO THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT IN THE SALE OF CLUSTER BOMBS IN 1986. AFTER TWO SHIPMENTS OF DEFECTIVE BOMBS, THE IRANIANS DECIDED THAT THEY COULD CAUSE MORE CASUALTIES AMONG THEIR OWN MEN THAN AMONG ENEMY TROOPS. STROIAZZO WAS TAKEN HOSTAGE FOR 18 MONTHS. HE MANAGED TO LEAVE AND TRAVELED TO CHILE. WITH THE HELP OF CNI DIRECTOR BRIGADIER GENERAL HUGO SALAS, HE CONTACTED CORFO OFFICIALS WHO HELPED HIM ARRANGE COMPENSATION. HE ARRANGED A PRELIMINARY ACCORD FOR ESTABLISHING A TOXIC WASTE RECYCLING PLANT IN CHILE, BUT THE DEAL FAILED. HE THEN FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST CORFO IN THE 19TH CIVIL COURT OF SANTIAGO. CORFO HAS NOT YET BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE LAWSUIT. THE PROBLEM, AT LEAST AS FAR AS THE TOXIC WASTE PLANT IS CONCERNED, WILL BE INHERITED BY THE NEW GOVERNMENT -- WHICH WILL TAKE OVER ON 11 MARCH -- AND BY CORFO. DID FERRIMAR LIE TO THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT? THIS ENTERPRISE WAS KNOWN TO HAVE GOOD CONTACTS WITH THE AUTHORITIES. AMONG THE PARTNERS OF FERRIMAR OWNER ALDO PESCE WERE RETIRED GENERAL MANUEL CONTRERAS SEPULVEDA, FORMER CHIEF OF THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE, DINA; GENERAL RAUL REYES, FAMAE DIRECTOR, AND COLONEL CARLOS CARRENO, WHO WAS A FAMAE EXECUTIVE AND AN ADVISER TO FERRIMAR ON THE PRODUCTION OF THE "WASP" BOMBS. TO EXPORT ITS BOMBS, FERRIMAR NEEDED THE AUTHORIZATION OF THE DEFENSE AND FOREIGN MINISTRIES. THE COMPANY HAD TO PROVIDE WHAT IS KNOWN IN THE INTERNATIONAL WEAPONS MARKET IS KNOWN AS AN "END-USER CERTIFICATE" OR "FINAL-USER CERTIFICATE." FERRIMAR GOT ONE. IT WAS SIGNED IN AUGUST 1985 BY A NIGERIAN ARMY OFFICER WHO, ACCORDING TO SOURCES CLOSE TO THE CASE, HAD RETIRED A LONG TIME AGO. A "TRIANGLE OPERATION" WAS CARRIED OUT TO CONCEAL THE TRUE OPERATION. IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER THE DEFENSE MINISTRY HAS INDICTED ANYONE OVER THE DECEPTION BY WHICH IT WAS VICTIMIZED. AT THE END OF JANUARY 1986, THE FIRST 100 BOMBS WERE SHIPPED BY PLANE TO BANDAR ABBAS AIRPORT IN IRAN. EACH BOMB WEIGHED 227 KG AND CONTAINED 248 AMMUNITION PACKAGES, SOME OF THEM FOR IMMEDIATE DISCHARGE AND OTHERS FOR DELAYED ACTION. THESE WERE CAPABLE OF MINING LARGE AREAS FOR UP TO 72 HOURS AFTER A BATTLE. THE FIRST SHIPMENT WAS WORTH $7 MILLION; $1 MILLION WAS FOR STROIAZZO AND $1.5 MILLION WENT FOR THE COST OF THE BOMBS. THE PRICE OF THE BOMBS ABROAD WAS $14,000 EACH, BUT THEIR REAL COST WAS ONLY $3,000. THE CHILEAN CONTACT IN THIS OPERATION, FERNANDO PEREZ, WAS TO HAVE RECEIVED $4.5 MILLION. A TEST WAS PERFORMED IN IRAN AND THE BOMBS DID NOT WORK. THE IRANIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY ASKED THAT NEW TESTS BE CARRIED OUT IN CHILE.
DEV-MUC3-1130	BOGOTA, 20 FEB 90 -- U.S. AMBASSADOR TO COLOMBIA THOMAS MCNAMARA HAS BEEN DECLARED A PRIORITY "MILITARY TARGET" OF THE MARXIST ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION GUERRILLA GROUP, THE ELN ANNOUNCED TODAY IN A COMMUNIQUE SENT TO EFE IN BOGOTA. THE COMMUNIQUE WAS DELIVERED IN THE MIDST OF AN ELN OFFENSIVE THAT HAS LASTED FOR OVER THREE WEEKS. IT HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY KIDNAPPINGS, ATTACKS ON TOWNS, MOBILE ROADBLOCKS ON THE MAIN HIGHWAYS, AND AMBUSHES SET FOR MILITARY AND POLICE PERSONNEL. ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLA GROUP, THE PURPOSE OF THE ATTACK IS TO PROTEST U.S. INTERVENTION IN COLOMBIA, TO SABOTAGE THE MUNICIPAL AND LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR 11 MARCH, AND THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS ON 27 MAY, AND TO DENOUNCE THE "DIRTY WAR." IN TODAY'S MESSAGE THE ELN LISTS "AMBASSADOR THOMAS MCNAMARA" AS A "PRIORITY" MILITARY OBJECTIVE AT THE TOP OF THEIR LIST. IT ADDED THAT OTHER TARGETS ARE "U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS," "U.S. CITIZENS WHO HEAD THE MULTINATIONAL TEXAS AND OCCIDENTAL OIL COMPANIES," AND "ALL AMERICANS WHO INTERVENE IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER IN OUR NATION'S INTERNAL CONFLICT." THIS PRO-CASTRO GUERRILLA GROUP IS HOLDING U.S. CITIZENS DAVID LESLIE KENT AND JAMES ARTHUR DONELLY, WHO WERE KIDNAPPED IN MEDELLIN ON 12 AND 13 FEBRUARY, TO PROTEST U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH'S VISIT TO THIS COUNTRY.
DEV-MUC3-1131	BOGOTA, 20 FEB 90 -- BUSH MET ON 15 FEBRUARY IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS WITH HIS COUNTERPARTS ALAN GARCIA OF PERU, JAIME PAZ OF BOLIVIA, AND VIRGILIO BARCO OF COLOMBIA IN WHAT BECAME KNOWN AS THE "DRUG SUMMIT." U.S. PRIEST FRANCISCO AMICO FERRARI, KIDNAPPED ON 15 FEBRUARY IN CALI, WAS RELEASED ON 19 FEBRUARY BY THE ELN WITH A MESSAGE ABOUT "OPERATION COLOMBIA," WHICH DENOUNCES U.S. INTERVENTION IN THE "DIRTY WAR" WITH WHICH COLOMBIA IS AFFLICTED. IN TODAY'S COMMUNIQUE THE GUERRILLAS SAY "THE UNITED STATES HAS MILITARY ADVISERS IN THE COLOMBIAN ARMY HEADQUARTERS TO DIRECT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DIRTY WAR." THEY ALSO DENOUNCE "THE DIRECT LEADERSHIP OF U.S. ADVISERS IN INTELLIGENCE AND MILITARY REPRESSION OPERATIONS IN THE AREAS OF CONFLICT." THE ELN IS ALSO STILL HOLDING SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE SENATOR JORGE SEDANO GONZALEZ, KIDNAPPED ON 9 FEBRUARY NEAR BUCARAMANGA, IN THE NORTHEASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY, ALONG WITH HIS SECRETARY JORGE MESA, WHO WAS RELEASED ON MONDAY. THE ELN RELEASED MESA WITH A MESSAGE FOR FORMER SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE PRESIDENT MISAEL PASTRANA , REITERATING THAT SEDANO WILL BE RELEASED ONLY IF HE DECLARES THAT HE IS OPPOSED TO THE DIRTY WAR AND REVEALS THE WHEREABOUTS OF FERNANDO PORRAS, AN ELN MEMBER WHO DISAPPEARED IN BUCARAMANGA ON 5 FEBRUARY. ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLAS, PORRAS WAS ARRESTED AND "DISAPPEARED" BY THE 5TH ARMY BRIGADE, WHICH DENIES THIS. THE ELN IS THE ONLY COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA GROUP THAT HAS PERSISTED IN THE ARMED STRUGGLE. THE FIVE OTHER REBEL GROUPS HAVE DECLARED UNILATERAL TRUCES TO GUARANTEE A CLIMATE OF PEACE FOR THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS. THESE GROUPS ARE THE COMMUNIST REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA, THE MAOIST POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY, THE TROTSKYIST WORKERS PARTY, AND THE INDIAN "QUINTIN LAME" MOVEMENT, IN ADDITION TO THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT, WHICH IS ABOUT TO CONCLUDE A PEACE PROCESS BEGUN 16 MONTHS AGO.
DEV-MUC3-1132	VALLELUPAR , 21 FEB 90 -- IN THE PAST FEW HOURS, THE SO-CALLED CAMILIST UNION ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION MURDERED A POLICE INSPECTOR AND TWO OF HIS BROTHERS, WHO WERE PEASANTS. THE INSPECTOR AND HIS BROTHERS WERE MURDERED BY THE UC-ELN WHO ACCUSED THEM OF BEING ARMY AND POLICE INFORMERS. THE TRIPLE CRIME OCCURRED ON THE EL LIMONCITO PATH, IN GUACHICA MUNICIPALITY, SOUTHERN CESAR DEPARTMENT. A POLICE SPOKESMAN SAID THAT THE REBELS HAD IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS UC-ELN MEMBERS. THESE THREE NEW VICTIMS OF THE REBEL OFFENSIVE WERE TAKEN BY FORCE FROM THEIR HOMES BEFORE THEY WERE KILLED. THE MURDERED INSPECTOR WAS IDENTIFIED AS GUSTAVO ROPERO NAVARRO, 22, FROM GUACHICA. HIS BROTHERS WERE IDENTIFIED AS MARIANO AND FELIX ROPERO NAVARRO, 26 AND 24, RESPECTIVELY. AFTER THE CRIME, THE REBELS FLED INTO THE EASTERN MOUNTAIN RANGE. THE ELN HAS STARTED A NEW WAVE OF VIOLENCE IN THE PAST HOURS. IT HAS MURDERED THREE PEASANTS IN GUACHICONO, SOUTHERN CAUCA DEPARTMENT, TWO IN ANTIOQUIA, AND THREE IN CORDOBA. THESE PEOPLE WERE KILLED AFTER BEING ACCUSED BY THE ELN OF BEING INFORMANTS.
DEV-MUC3-1133	TEGUCIGALPA, 22 FEB 90 -- CONTRA COMMANDER ISRAEL GALEANO, ALIAS FRANKLIN, HAS TOLD TIEMPO THAT THE ANTI-SANDINIST REBELS WILL STAY ARMED, REGARDLESS OF THE RESULTS OF THE 25 FEBRUARY ELECTIONS IN NICARAGUA, TO MAKE SURE THE DEMOCRATIC CHANGES TAKE PLACE. "WE WILL MAINTAIN OUR ORGANIZATION INTACT EVEN IF THE UNO WINS, WAITING FOR PROFOUND DEMOCRATIC CHANGES AND AN END TO THE REPRESSIVE REGIME IMPOSED BY THE SANDINISTS," SAID THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE . THIS PAST JANUARY, THE 29-YEAR-OLD GALEANO BECAME THE LEADER OF ABOUT 12,000 NICARAGUAN RIGHTIST REBELS BASED IN HONDURAS WHEN THE POST OF COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE RN ARMY, A POST ENRIQUE BERMUDEZ HAD HELD FOR 10 YEARS, WAS ELIMINATED. NICARAGUA WILL HOLD ELECTIONS ON SUNDAY, 25 FEBRUARY, AND THE MAIN CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ARE DANIEL ORTEGA OF THE SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT AND VIOLETA DE CHAMORRO OF THE UNO. THE REBELS, SUPPORTED BY THE UNITED STATES, HAVE URGED NICARAGUANS TO VOTE FOR THE UNO CANDIDATE. "IF THE UNO WINS, WE WILL MAINTAIN OUR ORGANIZATION INTACT TO SEE IF ON 25 APRIL THERE IS A TOTAL TRANSFER OF POWER AND PROFOUND REFORMS, AND PARTICULARLY TO SEE IF THE REPRESSIVE SYSTEM DISAPPEARS," GALEANO SAID. "IF THE SANDINISTS WIN OR STEAL THE ELECTIONS, THERE WILL BE A SOCIAL DISRUPTION AGAINST THE SYSTEM AND THE HARDEST STRUGGLE OF RECENT YEARS WILL TAKE PLACE," HE ADDED. THE CONTRA MILITARY CHIEF SAID THAT "IF THE PEOPLE DO NOT ACCEPT A SANDINIST VICTORY, "WE WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE FIGHTING." HE ASSURED THAT THE NICARAGUANS WILL NOT ACCEPT AN FSLN VICTORY IN THE 25 FEBRUARY ELECTIONS. GALEANO ADDED THAT THE SANDINISTS HAVE DEPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 30,000 TROOPS IN THE NORTHERN NICARAGUAN DEPARTMENTS IN ORDER TO "INTIMIDATE AND MURDER" UNO FOLLOWERS AND TO PREVENT APPROXIMATELY 300,000 NICARAGUANS FROM VOTING. GALEANO POINTED OUT THAT THE PRESS AND THE FOREIGN OBSERVERS OF THE ELECTIONS HAVE NO ACCESS TO THE AREAS WHERE THE NICARAGUAN TROOPS HAVE DEPLOYED. "EVEN THOUGH THE FOREIGN OBSERVERS CLAIM THAT THE CAMPAIGN WAS FREELY HELD, THE PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO MAKE SACRIFICES," HE SAID. GALEANO SAID THAT ABOUT 5,000 OF HIS MEN ARE INSIDE NICARAGUA, AND BETWEEN 10,000 TO 12,000 MEN ARE IN BASES IN HONDURAS, "NOT MOVING,BUT JUST OBSERVING THE ELECTORAL PROCESS" IN NICARAGUA. THE REBELS IN HONDURAS ARE RECEIVING U.S. HUMANITARIAN AID IN EL PRAISO DEPARTMENT AND HAVE REJECTED A DEMOBILIZATION PLAN APPROVED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS. THE REBELS CLAIM THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY GUARANTEES FOR THEIR PERSONAL SECURITY AND FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. "THE DEMOBILIZATION IS BASED ON THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT CREATING CONDITIONS THAT WILL ENCOURAGE THE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED RN TO JOIN CIVIC LIFE," HE ADDED. GALEANO SAID THAT THE DISMANTLING OF HIS FORCES DOES NOT "DEPEND OF A SIMPLE ELECTIONS," BUT RATHER ON "THE SANDINISTS LEAVING POWER COMPLETELY." THE CONTRA LEADER WARNED THAT "WE CANNOT LAY DOWN OUR WEAPONS WHEN THE CAUSES THAT LED TO OUR TAKING UP ARMS HAVE NOT DISAPPEARED. THERE STILL IS REPRESSION, A LACK OF FREEDOM, AND ALL OF THIS WAS GENERATED BY THE SANDINISTS." HE POINTED OUT THAT IN THE EVENT THE UNO SHOULD WIN THE 25 FEBRUARY ELECTIONS, "WE WOULD HAVE TO CARRY OUT A MUTUAL DEMOBILIZATION. THE NICARAGUAN PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED WITH AN INTER-AMERICAN PEACE FORCE THAT WILL RECEIVE ALL THE WEAPONRY AND SOVIET TANKS OF THE SANDINISTS. THEN, WHEN WE ARE AT AN EVEN LEVEL OF FORCES, WE WILL TURN OVER OUR OWN WEAPONS." THE CONTRA CHIEF SUGGESTED A NATIONAL POLICE BE CREATED IN NICARAGUA. FRANKLIN SAID THAT THE CONTRAS ARE WILLING TO CONTINUE THE PEACE TALKS, BUT PERHAPS AFTER THE ELECTIONS, WITH THE NEW NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT. HE ASSURED THAT THE REBEL FORCES WILL NOT CARRY OUT "ANY OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS BEFORE, DURING, OR AFTER THE ELECTIONS, AND WILL WAIT AND SEE IF THERE ARE CHANGES IN NICARAGUA." HE SAID THAT THE CONTRAS ARE WILLING TO LEAVE THEIR CAMPS IN YAMALES IF REQUESTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF RAFAEL LEONARDO CALLEJAS. "IF POLITICAL CONDITIONS DO NOT ALLOW US TO REMAIN, WE WILL LEAVE , BUT OUR REFUGEEES WILL STAY, AS REFUGEES," HE ADDED. THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE CONTRAS SAID THAT HIS FORCES WILL NOT ATTACK THE UN PEACE OBSERVORS ON THE HONDURAN-NICARAGUAN BORDER AREA. HE SAID THAT RN RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES ARE NORMAL, BUT DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE OUSTING OF BERMUDEZ, ARGUING THIS IS A FAIT ACCOMPLI.
DEV-MUC3-1134	MOSCOW , 18 FEB 90 -- THE ANNALS OF THE COLOMBIAN PORT OF CARTAGENA LIST THREE EXTREMELY FIERCE SIEGES. BACK IN 1586, THE "JEWEL OF THE CARIBBEAN" WAS CAPTURED BY SIR FRANCIS DRAKE, WHO DID NOT BURN THE CITY TO THE GROUND ONLY BECAUSE HE RECEIVED A RANSOM OF 10 MILLION PESOS. A CENTURY LATER CARTAGENA WAS OCCUPIED BY THE FRENCH. FINALLY, IN 1741, THE CITY'S DEFENDERS SUCCESSFULLY FOUGHT OFF AN ASSAULT BY A HOST OF 27,000 PIRATES HEADED BY SIR EDWARD VERNON... THE WESTERN PRESS DESCRIBED THE MEETING BETWEEN THE PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES, BOLIVIA, COLOMBIA, AND PERU HELD A FEW DAYS AGO IN CARTAGENA AS A KIND OF ASSAULT. DESPITE SOME EXAGGERATION, THIS GRAPHIC DESCRIPTION WAS BASED ON PERFECTLY SERIOUS GROUNDS. AFTER ALL, THE CONFERENCE DID DISCUSS IMMEDIATE TASKS AND EVEN A DETAILED SCHEDULE FOR A JOINT OFFENSIVE BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF THESE COUNTRIES AGAINST CRIMINAL DRUG TRAFFICKING, WHICH RANKS FIRST IN THE PECKING ORDER OF CRIME. IT IS INDEED NECESSARY TO LAUNCH AN ASSAULT AGAINST THE DRUG MAFIA'S STRONGHOLDS, WHETHER IN MEDELLIN, "FAMOUS" FOR UNBRIDLED GANGSTERISM, OR IN CARTAGENA ITSELF, WHOSE STATUS AS A RESORT IS THREATENED BY THE SELFSAME "COCAINE BARONS." AS A MATTER OF FACT, THIS TOURIST CENTER HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY SHAKEN IN RECENT MONTHS BY THE EXPLOSIONS OF BOMBS PLANTED BY TERRORISTS IN THE "HILTON" HOTEL, IN STORES, OR AT ITS MARINAS. IT IS NO WONDER, AS REUTER REPORTS, THAT NOT A SINGLE CRUISE SHIP HAS DROPPED ANCHOR THERE THIS SEASON. YES, THE SITUATION IS HIGHLY ALARMING, AND THIS APPLIES TO THE WHOLE OF COLOMBIA AND EVEN TO THE ENTIRE REGION. IN THESE CONDITIONS THE FIRM RESOLVE DISPLAYED BY THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE CARTAGENA MEETING DESERVES UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORT: THE RESOLVE TO FINALLY POOL THEIR EFFORTS IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST ORGANIZED CRIME AND TO JOINTLY PLACE A RELIABLE BARRIER IN ITS PATH. THESE ARE THE INTENTIONS SHOWN IN THE JOINT STATEMENT SIGNED BY THE FOUR PRESIDENTS AND BY THE SERIES OF SPECIAL DOCUMENTS. THE AIM OF THESE AGREEMENTS IS NOBLE INDEED: TO BESIEGE THE DRUG MAFIA IN ITS NESTS, TO CUT OFF THE "LAUNDERING" OF DRUG DOLLARS, AND TO DEPRIVE THE MERCHANTS OF "SLOW DEATH" OF BROAD ACCESS TO THE "BLACK MARKET" IN THE UNITED STATES, WHERE, AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE LION'S SHARE OF SOUTH AMERICA'S POISONOUS EXPORT IS CONSUMED. IN OTHER WORDS, AN IMPORTANT STEP HAS BEEN TAKEN TO COMBAT ONE OF THE MAIN "EVILS OF THE 20TH CENTURY," AND IT WAS NOT FOR NOTHING THAT THE MEETING'S RESULTS WERE POSITIVELY APPRAISED BY UN SECRETARY GENERAL J. PEREZ DE CUELLAR. HERE IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION: EMPHASIS IN CARTAGENA WAS PLACED ON ADMINISTRATIVE AND POLICE MEASURES AND ON WASHINGTON'S PRIMARILY MILITARIZED FORMS OF COOPERATION WITH THE ANDEAN STATES, BUT DOES THIS CONFORM WITH THEIR LONG-TERM NATIONAL INTERESTS, WITH THEIR DESIRE TO PUT AN END TO BACKWARDNESS AND ATTAIN A QUALITATIVELY NEW LEVEL OF SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT? AFTER ALL, A RADICAL SOLUTION OF THE DRUG PROBLEM PRIMARILY DEMANDS NEITHER COMBAT AIRCRAFT NOT ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS, BUT SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT. IT IS NECESSARY TO CHANGE THE ECONOMIC PROFILE OF VAST PROVINCES WHERE THE CULTIVATION OF COCA AND MARIJUANA IS THE SOLE SOURCE OF THE POPULATION'S EXISTENCE. TRUE ENOUGH, THE UNITED STATES HAS NOW EXPRESSED READINESS TO ASSIST ALSO IN THIS SPHERE. ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE IS AN ALMOST TOTAL LACK OF READINESS TO IMPORT FROM SOUTH AMERICA THE CROPS WHICH COULD, IN PRINCIPLE, SQUEEZE OUT COCA AND MARIJUANA. IT WAS NOT FOR NOTHING THAT COLOMBIA'S PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, THE WHITE HOUSE'S CLOSEST ALLY IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUGS, WAS FORCED TO DECLARE IN CARTAGENA THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S RIGID PROTECTIONIST MEASURES ARE JEOPARDIZING THE VERY FUTURE OF "ALTERNATIVE" SECTORS OF TROPICAL CROP FARMING -- THE CULTIVATION OF COFFEE, FLOWERS, AND SUGAR CANE. AND SO THE "SENIOR PARTNER" APPEARS TO BE TIGHTENING WITH THE ONE HAND THE VISE IN WHICH THE DRUG MAFIA NOW FINDS ITSELF, WHILE USING THE OTHER HAND TO PROTECT ITS MARKET FROM LEGAL LATIN AMERICAN EXPORTS. FINALLY, THE LAST BUT, I THINK, MOST SUBSTANTIVE ARGUMENT. ACTUALLY, IT ALSO CASTS AN UNFAVORABLE LIGHT ON THE ROLE OF CONSISTENT FIGHTER AGAINST THE DRUG MAFIA WHICH WASHINGTON HAS NOW ASSUMED. THIS ARGUMENT IS PERFECTLY ENCAPSULATED IN JUST ONE SHORT WORD: "PANAMA." INDEED, DID THE RECENT AGGRESSION AGAINST THIS SOVEREIGN STATE, ONE OF WHOSE MAIN MOTIVES WAS ACTUALLY "TO PUNISH THE DRUG BUSINESS BOSSES," NOT DEMONSTRATE ALL THE FLAWS OF WASHINGTON'S "STRONGARM APPROACH" TOWARD LATIN AMERICA? AND ARE THERE ANY GUARANTEES THAT THE PENTAGON WILL NOT START "COPYING" ITS PANAMANIAN EXPERIENCE IN OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE CONTINENT ON THE PRETEXT OF PURSUING THE "COCAINE BARONS"? THESE ARE FAR FROM RHETORICAL QUESTIONS, AND IT IS A PITY THAT CARTAGENA SIMPLY FAILED TO PROVIDE EVEN THE SLIGHTEST CLEAR-CUT ANSWERS TO THEM.
DEV-MUC3-1135	TEGUCIGALPA, 22 FEB 90 -- THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS CHARGED IN TEGUCIGALPA TODAY THAT ON 19 FEBRUARY THE SANDINIST AIR FORCE USED AIRPLANES AND HELICOPTERS TO BOMB SEVERAL COMMUNITIES IN ZELAYA, MATAGALPA, AND JINOTEGA DEPARTMENTS, IN CENTRAL AND NORTHERN NICARAGUA. THE REBELS DID NOT REPORT ANY DEAD OR WOUNDED IN THE ALLEGED ATTACKS, WHICH THE CONTRAS SAY ARE PART OF AN OFFENSIVE BEGUN IN THE DAYS PRIOR TO THE ELECTIONS, SCHEDULED FOR SUNDAY, 25 FEBRUARY. IN A COMMUNIQUE, THE CONTRAS INDICATED THAT THEIR FIGHTERS ARE NOT ATTACKING SANDINIST MILITARY TARGETS, AND THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE NICARAGUAN MILITARY ACTION WAS TO "CREATE CONFUSION" REGARDING THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. ON THE OTHER HAND, COMMANDER "FRANKLIN" OF THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE GENERAL STAFF SAID THAT THE RN WILL REMAIN "INTACT," EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT THE ELECTIONS ARE WON BY VIOLETA DE CHAMORRO, CANDIDATE OF THE NATIONAL OPPOSITION UNION . "WE WILL REMAIN INTACT TO SEE IF THERE IS A TOTAL TRANSMISSION OF POWER ON 25 APRIL, IN WHICH THE NEW GOVERNMENT WILL MAKE IN-DEPTH REFORMS, PARTICULARLY THE ELIMINATION OF THE REPRESSIVE SYSTEM," HE ADDED. THE RN MILITARY CHIEF SAID THAT IF THE SANDINISTS WIN OR "STEAL" THE ELECTIONS, THERE WILL BE A "SOCIAL UPRISING" IN NICARAGUA AGAINST THE SYSTEM, AND THERE WILL BE "A HARSHER STRUGGLE THAN THAT OF PAST YEARS." "FRANKLIN" SAID THAT THE SANDINISTS HAVE DEPLOYED SOME 30,000 TROOPS TO DEPARTMENTS IN NORTHERN NICARAGUA TO "INTIMIDATE AND MURDER" UNO SYMPATHIZERS. HE EMPHASIZED THAT THE CONTRAS WILL NOT PUT DOWN THEIR WEAPONS, BECAUSE THE CAUSE THAT LED TO THE CREATION OF THOSE FORCES -- THE SANDINISTS' ASCENT TO POWER -- "HAS NOT YET DISAPPEARED," AND "THE REPRESSION CONTINUES." HE ADDED THAT HIS FIGHTERS ARE WILLING TO LEAVE THE CAMPS IN EASTERN HONDURAS IF THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT REQUESTS THAT THEY DO SO, BUT THEIR FAMILIES WOULD REMAIN.
DEV-MUC3-1136	BUENOS AIRES, 22 FEB 90 -- A RELIABLE SOURCE TODAY DISCLOSED THAT THE DEPLOYMENT OF CHILEAN ARMED FORCES TO SOUTHERN CHILE, INCLUDING ARMORED UNITS, AND THE IMPROVED TECHNOLOGY AND QUALITY OF THE WEAPONS OF THE CHILEAN ARMED FORCES ARE CAUSING CONCERN IN THE DEFENSE AREA. THE SOURCE SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED THE MANUFACTURE OF A HELICOPTER BY A PRIVATE CHILEAN FACTORY AS WELL AS THE PURCHASE OF SPANISH AND U.S.-MADE AIRPLANES AND HELICOPTERS. THE HELICOPTER, WHOSE PROTOTYPE HAS ALREADY FLOWN A LARGE NUMBER OF HOURS, HAS RECEIVED THE APPROVAL OF THE U.S. "AVIATION AGENCY" , AN INDISPENSABLE REQUIREMENT FOR SUBSEQUENT SALES ABROAD. IT IS MANUFACTURED BY THE PRIVATE CHILEAN FACTORY CARDOEN WHICH PRODUCES CLUSTER BOMBS AND OTHER WAR MATERIEL THAT CHILE EXPORTS TO THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES. THE SOURCE SAID THAT, DUE TO ITS EASY MAINTENANCE, OPERATION, AND LOW COST, THIS HELICOPTER IS IDEAL FOR EXPORT TO TRADITIONAL CHILEAN MARKETS SINCE SUBSTANTIAL PRODUCTION IS EASY TO ACHIEVE. THE SOURCE ALSO INDICATED THAT IN NOVEMBER, ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF CHILEAN ARMY AVIATION, THREE SPANISH-MADE CASA 235 AIRPLANES, WHICH CAN BE USED TO TRANSPORT PASSENGERS AND CARGO, AND 15 U.S.-MADE ENSTROM 280 HELICOPTERS WERE PRESENTED. THE SOURCE DID NOT DISCLOSE "OTHER DATA," WHICH "REVEALS A STRENGTHENING OF THE CHILEAN NAVAL, AIR, SEA, AND COMBAT AVIATION RECENTLY."
DEV-MUC3-1137	SAN SALVADOR, 22 FEB 90 -- TWO ARMY MEMBERS WERE KILLED AND FIVE WERE WOUNDED DURING THE HEAVY CLASHES THAT TOOK PLACE SIMULTANEOUSLY IN VARIOUS PLACES IN THE CAPITAL TONIGHT, MILITARY SOURCES REPORTED. NATIONAL POLICE AGENT CIPRIANO APARICIO ALVAREZ WAS KILLED WHEN ALLEGED GUERRILLA URBAN COMMANDOS MACHINEGUNNED POLICEMEN AT THE INTERSECTION OF NO. 5 WEST STREET AND NO. 5 NORTH AVENUE. AN ARMY MEMBER WAS KILLED WHEN SOLDIERS IN A TRENCH ON VENEZUELA BOULEVARD, NEAR ROMA, WERE MACHINEGUNNED. IT HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED THAT AN OFFICER AND FOUR SOLDIERS WERE SERIOUSLY WOUNDED DURING A HEAVY CLASH WITH GUERRILLAS AT NO. 79 NORTH AVENUE. THE SKIRMISHES TOOK PLACE SIMULTANEOUSLY AT APPROXIMATELY 1900 IN DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR AND IN ROMA, ESCALON, AND LA MASCOTA NEIGHBORHOODS, CAUSING ALARM AMONG THE SAN SALVADOR RESIDENTS.
DEV-MUC3-1138	BOGOTA, 24 FEB 90 -- THE RECENT CEASE-FIRE OFFER BY THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA WAS ACCEPTED TODAY BY THE SO-CALLED COMMISSION OF NOTABLES, WHOSE MEMBERS ARE FIVE FORMER PRESIDENTS, AND CHURCH AND BUSINESS REPRESENTATIVES. HOWEVER, IN A MESSAGE ADDRESSED TO THE GUERRILLAS' CENTRAL COMMAND, THE COMMISSION OF NOTABLES SAID THAT, ONCE THE CEASE-FIRE IS PUT INTO EFFECT, THE FARC WILL HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE "WITH UNEQUIVOCAL DEEDS," THEIR WILLINGNESS TO INITIATE PEACE TALKS. THE FARC -- THE COUNTRY'S OLDEST AND LARGEST GUERRILLA GROUP -- HAS EXPRESSED OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS THEIR INTENTION OF DECREEING A CEASE-FIRE, ALTHOUGH YESTERDAY, ACCORDING TO ARMY SPOKESMEN, A FARC COLUMN KILLED SEVEN SOLDIERS AND KIDNAPPED 15 DURING AN ATTACK ON AN ARMY GARRISON. A FEW DAYS AGO, THE COMMISSION OF NOTABLES, MADE UP OF FORMER PRESIDENTS CARLOS LLERAS RSTREPO, ALFONSO LOPEZ MIC HELSEN, JULIO CESAR TURBAY, MISAEL PASTRANA BORRERO, AND BELISARIO BETANCUR, AS WELL AS CARDINAL MARIO REVOLLO BRAVO AND BUSINESSMAN FABIO ECHEVERRI CORREA, TOLD THE FARC THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAD A RIGHT TO FIGHT THEM. THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY HOLDING PEACE TALKS ONLY WITH THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT , WHICH WILL SOON BE DEMOBILIZING THEIR FRONTS TO REJOIN CIVILIAN LIFE. AT THE SAME TIME, THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THIS YEAR IT WILL STEP UP ITS ATTACKS IN AN EFFORT TO SABOTAGE THE 11 MARCH MUNICIPAL AND PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS AND THE 27 MAY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.
DEV-MUC3-1139	MEDELLIN, 24 FEB 90 -- TWO U.S. CITIZENS, WHO HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED BY GUERRILLAS ON 12 FEBRUARY IN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT IN NORTHWESTERN COLOMBIA, WERE RELEASED TODAY. JAMUS ARTHUR DONELLY, AN AUTOMOTIVE SPARE PARTS SALESMAN, AND PROFESSOR DAVIS LESLIE KENT, WHO SPOKE TO NEWSMEN IN MEDELLIN, REVEALED A MESSAGE FROM THE PRO-CASTROITE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION, WHICH HELD THEM HOSTAGE FOR 12 DAYS. "THE NEXT TIME THERE IS A MASSACRE OR THE GOVERNMENT CAUSES THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ONE OF OUR COMPANIONS, SUCH AS JUAN FERNANDO PORRAS, THE ELN WILL PUNISH THE WEALTHY PEOPLE, THE OLIGARCHY OF COLOMBIA," THE EXTREMIST GROUP'S MESSAGE STATED. BOTH DONELLY, 62, AS WELL AS KENT, 40, SAID THEY WERE TREATED WELL BY THE REBELS, WITH WHOM THEY HAD BROAD DISCUSSIONS ON THE SITUATION IN COLOMBIA. ACCORDING TO THE TWO U.S. CITIZENS, THE ELN KIDNAPPED THEM AS PART OF THE SO-CALLED "OPERATION COLOMBIA" TO PROTEST THE RECENT PRESENCE OF U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH IN COLOMBIA, WHICH HOSTED THE RECENT 15 FEBRUARY ARTIDRUG SUMMIT IN CARTAGENA, AND WHAT THEY CALLED "INCREASING U.S. INTERVENTION IN COLOMBIA." DONELLY AND KENT WERE TURNED OVER BY THE ELN TO A COMMISSION MADE UP OF OFFICIALS OF THE ANTIOQUIA REGIONAL ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND MEMBERS OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION IN A REGION NEAR COCORNA, 80 KM SOUTHEAST OF MEDELLIN.
DEV-MUC3-1140	SAN SALVADOR, 26 FEB 90 -- WE BELIEVE THAT THE ELECTIONS IN NICARAGUA WILL MARK A NEW PHASE IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN SITUATION. THINGS WILL NOT BE THE SAME IN THAT NEIGHBORING NATION AND I BELIEVE THAT THE EVOLUTION WILL FAVOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PEACE AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL. MOREOVER, THERE ARE OTHER ELEMENTS AT THE WORLD LEVEL THAT ALSO ALLOW US TO HAVE HOPE. LET US NOT FORGET THAT THE UNITED NATIONS PARTICULARLY IS STRIVING TO ORGANIZE A NEW ROUND OF TALKS. THEREFORE, WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONDITIONS ARE BEING SET SO THAT PEACE MAY BE ACHIEVED THIS YEAR. THE CHURCH URGES THOSE WHO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS DECISION TO DO IT AND THUS PAY HOMAGE TO OUR ARCHBISHOP MSGR ROMERO, WHO DIED 10 YEARS AGO, AND A MAN WHO STRUGGLED FOR PEACE, ENGINEER DUARTE. THAT WAS OUR PROPOSAL IN TODAY'S HOMILY. WILL THERE BE ANY DEMAND FOR AN INVESTIGATION OR RESOLUTION OF THIS CASE EVEN THOUGH MSGR ROMERO WAS ASSASSINATED 10 YEARS AGO? WE ARE CONVINCED THAT THE SOLUTION OF THIS CASE BASICALLY DEPENDS ON A POLITICAL DECISION TO DO IT. THEREFORE, IT COULD REMAIN UNSOLVED OR IT COULD BE QUICKLY SOLVED. WE WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT A POLITICAL DECISION WOULD BE ADOPTED, BUT WE HAVE NO INFORMATION TO INDICATE THAT THIS WILL BE SO. INSTEAD, IT IS MORE A WISH, I BELIEVE IT IS A LEGITIMATE WISH, OF ALL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. THEY WANT THE CASE TO BE SOLVED AND, ABOVE ALL, THEY WANT JUSTICE. THIS BLOOD SHOULD BEAR FRUIT BY ACHIEVING PEACE AND RESPECT AMONG MEN, AS A NEW FORM OF SOCIAL COEXISTENCE IN EL SALVADOR. VIOLENCE SHOULD NO LONGER EXIST AMONG US AND RECONCILIATION SHOULD QUICKLY BECOME A REALITY AMONG SALVADORANS. A WASHINGTON POST ARTICLE REVEALED THAT COL. BENAVIDES HAS RECENTLY BEEN SEEN AT A SEASIDE . WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ABOUT THIS? WE BELIEVE THAT THE TRIALS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY WILL BE ANOTHER TEST FOR SALVADORAN JUSTICE. IT HAS FAILED ALMOST ALL OTHER TESTS . LET US SEE HOW IT FARES THIS TIME, NOT ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF ITS PRESTIGE, BUT ALSO FOR THE SAKE OF THE HONOR OF SUCH A MUCH-SACRIFICED PEOPLE AND THE NEED TO GIVE THE PEOPLE HOPE. I BELIEVE THAT IMPORTANT STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN, BUT THE TIME HAS COME TO PROVE THAT THESE STEPS WILL LEAD TO A TRULY JUST CONCLUSION -- OR IF THEY WILL ONCE AGAIN BE CUT SHORT. LET US HOPE THAT PROGRESS WILL BE ACHIEVED AND, AS WE HAVE STATED ON OTHER OCCASIONS, THAT THE NAMES OF THE INTELLECTUAL AUTHORS OF THIS CRIME WILL ALSO BE KNOWN.
DEV-MUC3-1141	SAN SALVADOR, 26 FEB 90 -- MONSIGNOR, REFERRING TO THE WEEK'S EVENTS, YOU DID NOT TALK ABOUT THE CORRUPTION CASE MENTIONED BY THE GOVERNMENT. WHAT IMPLICATIONS MIGHT THIS CASE HAVE? I THINK IT IS TOO SOON TO HAVE A CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT MAY BE BEHIND THIS NEW SITUATION. WE MUST WAIT AWHILE FOR SOME TIME AND LEARN THE DETAILS. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE WORSE THINGS WHICH SHOULD BE SOLVED. WE WOULD NOT LIKE TO EXPAND ON THIS. ALL WE WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS THAT WE THINK THERE ARE STILL THINGS WE SHOULD KNOW TO HAVE A CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT IS BEHIND THE ANNOUNCEMENT MADE THIS WEEK. DO YOU THINK A FRAUD CAN BE PERPETRATED IN THE NICARAGUAN ELECTIONS? WE THINK THAT, REGARDLESS OF WHO WINS IN NICARAGUA, IT WILL REPRESENT A POSITIVE STEP FOR THAT COUNTRY AND ALL OF THE REGION. THE NICARAGUAN CHURCH SHARES OUR VIEWS, MEANING THE PASTORS OF THAT NATION. THAT IS WHY WE BELIEVE THAT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PEACE COULD BE NEAR FOR EL SALVADOR. HOW NICE IT WOULD BE IF WE AVAILED OURSELVES OF THIS OPPORTUNITY. MONSIGNOR, THE ARCHBISHOPRIC'S LEGAL ASSISTANCE HAS HELPED CLEAR MANY DEATHS IN EL SALVADOR. MONSIGNOR ROMERO WAS KILLED 10 YEARS AGO. DOES THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND THE LEGAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHO MIGHT BE BEHIND THIS DEATH? WE HAVE SAID MANY TIMES THAT THERE ARE MANY CLUES WHICH LEAD TO CERTAIN CONCLUSIONS BUT, ACCORDING TO OUR CURRENT LEGAL SYSTEM, THOSE CLUES CANNOT BE USED AS EVIDENCE. THUS, ONE CAN BE CERTAIN OF WHO THE KILLERS ARE AND STILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROVE IT. THAT IS ONE OF THE GREAT FRUSTRATIONS CREATED BY OUR LEGAL SYSTEM. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT WE HAVE SEVERAL IDEAS, WHICH WE HAVE COMMENTED ON MANY TIMES, OF WHO THE MONSIGNOR'S KILLERS MAY BE. ONCE MORE I SAY THAT THIS IS A MATTER OF MAKING A POLITICAL DECISION, PARTICULARLY TO CLEAR THE CASE OR LET IT REMAIN UNSOLVED. MONSIGNOR, FORMER PRESIDENT DUARTE HAS DIED. WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF DUARTE'S ROLE CONCERNING THE CHURCH? WE WILL STATE IT THIS AFTERNOON DURING THE SPECIAL MASS WITH ALMOST ALL THE BISHOPS OF EL SALVADOR. THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. I BELIEVE WE SHOULD SEE THREE LEVELS: THE MAN, THE CHRISTIAN, AND THE POLITICIAN. THE LETTER THAT THE ARCHBISHOP SENT TO DUARTE'S WIDOW, MRS. INES, STATES SOME IDEAS ON THE MAN, THE CHRISTIAN, AND THE POLITICIAN. THIS AFTERNOON THE ARCHBISHOP WILL HAVE A SPECIAL HOMILY AND HE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY GIVE A MORE COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE CHURCH'S VIEWS. WE CAN ADD THAT HE WAS A MAN WHO TRIED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH HIS CHRISTIAN FAITH. HE WAS A MAN WHO WAS OPEN TO THE CHURCH'S PROPOSAL.
DEV-MUC3-1142	BOGOTA, 26 FEB 90 -- SEVERAL COLOMBIAN PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULES, LIBERALS ERNESTO SAMPER PIZANO AND HERNANDO DURAN AND CONSERVATIVE RODRIGO LLOREDA CAICEDO, EXPRESSED THEIR WILLINGNESS TODAY TO HOLD A DIALOGUE WITH THE EXTRADITABLES, THE ARMED WING OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, AFTER THE EXTRADITABLES VOICED THEIR DESIRE FOR SUCH TALKS. THE EXTRADITABLES ASKED THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT TODAY TO COME UP WITH THE MECHANISMS TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO TURN THEMSELVES IN TO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM, SUCH AS SURRENDERING THEIR WEAPONS, AMMUNITION, AND EXPLOSIVES, ACCORDING TO A LETTER DELIVERED TO THE GROUP OF NOTABLES, A GROUP OF MEDIATORS. GOVERNMENT MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS AND OTHER AUTHORITIES REJECTED THE PROPOSALS MADE BY THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS. THERE WILL BE NO MECHANISMS AND NO COMMISSIONS OTHER THAN THE COURTS, LEMOS SAID WHEN HE HEARD ABOUT THE PROPOSAL SENT TO THE GROUP OF NOTABLES FROM MEDELLIN. THE GROUP OF NOTABLES IS COMPOSED OF FORMER LIBERAL PRESIDENTS ALFONSO LOPEZ AND JULIO CESAR TURBAY, FORMER SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE PRESIDENT MISAEL PASTRANA, BOGOTA ARCHBISHOP AND CARDINAL MARIO REVOLLO, AND DIEGO MONTANA, PRESIDENT OF THE LEFTIST PATRIOTIC UNION . LIBERAL SENATOR SAMPER PIZANO, AFTER LEARNING OF THE GOVERNMENT'S REFUSAL TO ACCEPT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS' PROPOSAL, SAID THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN WARMONGERING SPIRITS IN THE GOVERNMENT, WHO MUST CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDE SO AS TO PUT AN END TO THE WAR. THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ADDED THAT THE OFFERS MADE BY THE EXTRADITABLES COULD BE ACCEPTED WITHOUT DISMANTLING THE DE JURE STATE OR THE COUNTRY'S INSTITUTIONS. HERNANDO DURAN DESCRIBED THE PROPOSAL AS A STEP FORWARD IN THE EFFORTS BEING MADE TO NORMALIZE THE SITUATION OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, AND HE WARNED THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS OFFICERS MUST RESPOND TO THIS PROPOSAL. I BELIEVE THE NEW OFFER TENDS TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF DETENTE BETWEEN THOSE INVOLVED IN DRUG TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES AND THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF, DURAN SAID. SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE RODRIGO LLOREDA SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE OBLIGATION TO RESPOND TO THE EXTRADITABLES, AND HE ADDED THAT WHEN HE BECOMES PRESIDENT HE WILL DO SO. HOWEVER, LLOREDA CAICEDO SAID THAT THE BASIC CONDITIONS FOR REACHING AN AGREEMENT ON THEIR SURRENDER IS TO HAVE THOSE WHO COMMITTED CRIMES TURN THEMSELVES IN AND BE JUDGED BY THE COLOMBIAN JUSTICE SYSTEM. HE ADDED: IT IS ALSO NECESSARY FOR THEM TO COMPENSATE THE VICTIMS OF THEIR TERRORIST ACTIONS; THERE SHOULD BE GUARANTEES FOR THE DISMANTLING OF THEIR PRODUCTIVE APPARATUS; THERE SHOULD BE A SUSPENSION OF THE PROCESSING AND SHIPMENT OF COCAINE ABROAD; AND INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS SHOULD BE BROUGHT IN TO VERIFY THE PROCESS.
DEV-MUC3-1143	AYACUCHO, 26 FEB 90 -- IT WAS REPORTED TODAY IN AYACUCHO THAT AT LEAST 16 MEMBERS OF THE "PEASANT DEFENSE PATROL" DIED AND ANOTHER 30 WERE WOUNDED DURING AN ATTACK BY A "SHINING PATH" COLUMN. TRUCK DRIVERS WHO TRANSPORT FREIGHT TO THE ZONE AND WHO ARRIVED TODAY FROM MACHENTE , 196 KM NORTHEAST OF AYACUCHO, HAVE REPORTED THAT THE SHINING PATH ATTACK TOOK PLACE UNEXPECTEDLY ON FRIDAY NIGHT. THE DRIVERS REPORTS HAVE NOT BEEN DENIED NOR CONFIRMED BY MILITARY AND POLICE AUTHORITIES. THEY REPORTED THAT THEY SAW AMBULANCES CARRYING THE WOUNDED TO THE HOSPITAL IN SAN FRANCISCO, LA MAR PROVINCE. THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN PERU NOW STANDS AT MORE THAN 600 THIS YEAR, AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE KILLED SINCE THE "SHINING PATH" BEGAN ITS ARMED STRUGGLE IN 1980 NOW TOTALS 18,000 ACCORDING TO A CONGRESS COMMISSION WHICH IS STUDYING THE CAUSES OF VIOLENCE IN PERU. POLICE SOURCES TODAY REPORTED IN AYACUCHO, 575 KM SOUTHEAST OF LIMA, THAT ACCORDING TO REPORTS BY RELATIVES, OVER THE PAST WEEK 30 YOUNG MEN WERE ABDUCTED BY SHINING PATH COLUMNS THAT INTERCEPT PASSENGER BUSES AND PRIVATE VEHICLES ON THE HIGHWAYS IN THE DEPARTMENT. THE SOURCES ADDED THAT THE MAOIST GROUP IS RECRUITING PEOPLE LIKE THAT FOR THEIR ORGANIZATION, UNDER THREATS OF DEATH. THE GOVERNMENT TODAY EXTENDED THE STATE OF EMERGENCY FOR 60 DAYS IN NINE OF THE 24 DEPARTMENTS INTO WHICH PERU IS POLITICALLY DIVIDED, AMONG THEM AYACUCHO, BECAUSE OF THE TERRORIST ACTION THAT PERSISTS IN THOSE AREAS. THIS MEASURE WILL BE IMPLEMENTED UNTIL 2 WEEKS AFTER THE GENERAL LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS THAT ARE SCHEDULED FOR 8 APRIL 1990.
DEV-MUC3-1144	SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE -- MARIA DE DOLORES ARJAC. IT IS SAID THAT AID TO EL SALVADOR WAS STOPPED FOR AID TO PANAMA. COULD IT NOT HAPPEN -- WITH MRS. CHAMORRA'S VICTORY -- THAT READJUSTMENTS ARE MADE IN AID TO SEVERAL CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING EL SALVADOR? IN THIS RESPECT, THE FRG GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY RENEWED AID TO EL SALVADOR, BUT NOT TO OTHER COUNTRIES. HOW DO YOU SEE THIS SITUATION? WELL, THIS COULD WELL HAPPEN, AS, OBVIOUSLY, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ARE FREE TO GIVE AID TO WHATEVER COUNTRY THEY BELIEVE IT IS ADVISABLE TO DO SO. CERTAINLY THERE IS A NEW SITUATION, AND MANY HAVE EXPRESSED TODAY THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO HELP NICARAGUA, AS WELL AS PANAMA AND OTHERS. THIS SITUATION COULD PERFECTLY WELL LESSEN THE AMOUNT OF AID TO EL SALVADOR. THIS IS A POSSIBILITY. JUAN BURGOS OF INTERPRESS SERVICE. UN SECRETARY GENERAL THAT ARE INTERPRETED AS THAT PRESSURE WAS APPLIED TO YOU AND TO THE ARMED FORCES COMMANDERS BY SOME POLITICAL LEADERS. I CAN TELL YOU VERY CLEARLY, AND I BELIEVE THAT THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL CAN TESTIFY TO MY STATEMENTS, THAT OUR POSITION HAS BEEN FITTING AND CONSISTENT AND THAT WE MAINTAIN THE POSITION WE EXPRESSED TO HIM AT PRESENT. WE DID PLACE AS A PRE-CONDITION THAT THE FMLN STOP ALL TERRORIST ACTIONS. IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE UNITED NATIONS, AN ORGANIZATION THAT HAS CONDEMNED TERRORISM, CANNOT BACK OUR POSITION, AS WE ARE TRYING TO ELIMINATE FMLN TERRORIST ACTIONS. BUT WE HAVE NOT CHANGED OUR POSITION, AND IT IS THE SAME ONE WE EXPRESSED TO THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL. [MODERATOR) MARGARITA ARTEGA OF ACAN-EFE. MR. PRESIDENT, I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU IF THE MOBILIZATION OF PEASANTS TODAY COULD BE AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE STATE OF SIEGE IS ABOUT TO LIFTED, AS, SUPPOSEDLY, CONCENTRATIONS AND MOBILIZATIONS ARE PROHIBITED? IT DEPENDS ON THE SECURITY SITUATION. THE STATE OF SIEGE IS NOT PERMANENT. WE MUST ANALYZE THE CONTEXT OF THE THREAT THAT MIGHT EXIST WITH REGARD TO SECURITY. WE HAVE READ SOME REPORTS, THOUGH WE HAVE NOT YET CONFIRMED THEM, CLAIMING THAT THE FMLN HAS SAID THAT IT DOES NOT INTEND TO LAUNCH ANY MORE OFFENSIVES. IT IS A GOOD SIGN THAT THE FMLN IS LOOKING FOR A WAY TO A DIALOGUE, AND THIS COULD PRODUCE THE LIFTING OF THE STATE OF SIEGE. AS YOU KNOW, THE STATE OF SIEGE HAS BEEN GREATLY REDUCED. IT IS NOT THE SAME. WE HAVE BEEN REDUCING IT PROGRESSIVELY AND IT IS NOW STRICTLY WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR NATIONAL SECURITY. FRANCISCO ESPINOSA FOR ABC NEWS. WELL, I DO NOT KNOW. I BELIEVE THAT FOR A DIALOGUE TO TAKE PLACE, THE PRE-CONDITION HAS TO BE MET, REGARDLESS OF NICARGUAN ELECTION RESULTS AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE FMLN. OUR POSITION IS BASED ON PRINCIPLES, ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE PEOPLE NOT CONTINUE TO SUFFER THE VIOLENCE GENERATED BY FMLN TERRORISM. THUS, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE MET, REGARDLESS OF THE ELECTIONS. OBVIOUSLY, I BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF THE NICARAGUAN ELECTIONS WILL AFFECT THE FMLN IN SOME MEASURES, AND THIS COULD INCLUDE... I DO NOT KNOW. WE WOULD HAVE TO SEE WHAT POSITION THEY WILL TAKE IN THE FUTURE, BUT IT COULD BE. OBVIOUSLY A CHANGE HAS OCCURRED AND WILL HAVE AN IMPACT AND COULD MOVE THE FMLN TO CHANGE ITS POSITION.
DEV-MUC3-1145	SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE -- AND, THEREFORE, IT DOES NOT SEEM LIKE IT IS A TOTAL ADVANCEMENT IN A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT IS NOT VERY DEMOCRATIC TO HAVE THE ARMED FORCES OF A COUNTRY UNDER THE CONTROL OF ONE OF ITS POLITICAL PARTIES. THE ARMED FORCES OF A COUNTRY SHOULD RESPOND TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND TO THE GOVERNMENT THAT IS LEGITIMATELY ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE. AND THEREFORE, THIS WOULD CURTAIL THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE OF THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE IN TRYING TO CONTROL AND GOVERN THE COUNTRY, EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT FROM THE POSITION OF BEING PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTRY. SECONDLY, I THINK THAT I HAVE MENTIONED BEFORE THAT IT IS NOT THE RESULT OF THE ELECTION THAT WILL CHANGE OUR ATTITUDE WITH RESPECT TO OUR DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA, BUT RATHER THE ATTITUDE OF THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WITH RESPECT TO AID TO THE FMLN, TO THE MARXIST GUERRILLAS IN EL SALVADOR. AND IN THIS CASE WE STILL HAVE NOT SEEN THAT CHANGE TAKING PLACE. OBVIOUSLY, WE FEEL THAT WITH MRS CHAMORRO AS PRESIDENT OF NICARAGUA THAT THIS AID WILL STOP AND THEREFORE MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE RESUMPTION OF NORMAL RELATIONS BETWEEN EL SALVADOR AND NICARAGUA, BUT IT IS THAT ATTITUDE THAT WOULD MAKE A CHANGE AND NOT NECESSARILY THE RESULT IN ITSELF. WITH RESPECT TO THE THIRD QUESTION, OBVIOUSLY I THINK THAT IF MRS CHAMORRO REALLY IS IN CONTROL, IN TOTAL CONTROL, ESPECIALLY OF THE SANDINISTA ARMY, THAT THERE WILL BE A STOP IN AID, AND THEREFORE THE FMLN WOULD NOT HAVE NICARAGUA'S LOGISTICAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FOR THEM. AND THEREFORE, THIS CERTAINLY AFFECTS THEM. I THINK THAT ABOUT ONE WEEK AGO OR TWO WEEKS AGO IN THE WASHINGTON POST THERE WAS A REPORT THAT COLONEL BENAVIDES WAS LIVING A RATHER LUXURIOUS LIFE. I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN THAT PIECE. AND ALSO THE U.S. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER HAS SAID THAT HE FELT THAT IT WAS TIME THAT, WELL, THE ARTICLE IMPLIES THAT THERE WAS SOME PRESSURE, OR THERE WAS SOME PROTECTION COMING FROM THE TANDONA TO PROTECT BENAVIDES, BECAUSE HE THEIR MEN AND THAT SOME LOWER LIEUTENANTS WERE NOT GOING TO BE RECEIVING ANY SORT OF PROTECTION AND THEY MAY HAVE TO TAKE THE FAULT FOR WHAT HAS HAPPENED. AND ALSO WILLIAM WALKER HAD SAID THAT HE FELT THAT IT WAS TIME FOR SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THE TANDONA TO STEP DOWN AND FOR OTHER OFFICERS TO MOVE UP. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT ? SHOULD THERE BE THAT KIND OF PRESSURE? SHOULD SOME OF THE GUYS IN THE TANDONA STEP DOWN FROM THEIR POSTS? WELL, I THINK THAT IT IS NOT REALLY THE DETERMINING FACTOR WHETHER YOU BELONG TO A SPECIFIC GRADUATING CLASS WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES THAT SHOULD BE WHAT DETERMINES WHETHER YOU CONTINUE OR NOT, OR BE REMOVED OR NOT FROM THE ARMED FORCES. IT IS YOUR OWN PERFORMANCE AND YOUR OWN BEHAVIOR THAT SHOULD BE THE DETERMINING FACTOR. SO, THEREFORE, IT IS NOT NECESSARILY THAT THE TANDONA PEOPLE, JUST FOR BEING MEMBERS OF THE GRADUATING CLASS, THAT ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN AGAINST THEM. SO I THINK THAT IN THAT CASE THAT IS NOT REALLY THE POINT. WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHER CASE, I THINK IT IS NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY ON HOW IT GOES, WHAT TYPE OF DEFENSE THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN ARRAIGNED HAVE. I THINK THAT THEY ALL ARE RECEIVING THE LEGAL SUPPORT IN THE CASE AND THE OTHER . AS FOR THE DIALOGUE WITH THE GUERRILLAS, BEFORE YOU LEFT FOR TAIWAN YOU CONDITIONED THE DIALOGUE ON A CEASING OF ACTS OF VIOLENCE. TO BE SPECIFIC, DOES THIS MEAN ALL ACTS OF VIOLENCE? AND ALSO, WHEN DO YOU THINK THAT THIS DIALOGUE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE? WELL, IF WE COULD TRY AND PUT INTO ONE BASKET AND CALL THAT BASKET WITH A NAME WITH RESPECT TO THE ACTIONS, WE ARE ASKING THE FMLN TO STOP TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, BECAUSE TERRORIST ACTIVITY IS AFFECTING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. YOU JUST MENTIONED THE FACT ABOUT A POLE THAT THEY USE FOR ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION IN THE COUNTRY. JUST LAST NIGHT THEY BLEW UP ONE AND THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE HURT. TWO CIVILIANS THAT WERE PASSING BY WERE HURT BY THAT EXPLOSION. SO THAT IS WHAT HAS TO STOP. THE FMLN HAS TO STOP ALL TERRORIST ACTIVITY, BECAUSE THAT IS THE ACTIVITY THAT HURTS THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. THAT IS NOT MILITARY ACTIVITY. THAT IS SOMETHING GEARED AGAINST OR TO CONFRONT THE ARMED FORCES. SO IT IS THAT VIOLENCE THAT CAN BE SUMMED UP IN WHAT IS CALLED TERRORISM THAT WE ARE ASKING FOR -- THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT REALLY AFFECT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION OF THE COUNTRY.
DEV-MUC3-1146	BOGOTA, 1 MAR 90 -- COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS HAS HINTED THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN MEMBERS OF THE MARXIST GUERRILLA GROUP ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION WHO HAVE MURDERED THE 77 FOLLOWERS OF THE LEFT-WING PARTY THE PATRIOTIC UNION . LEMOS SAID: I CAN EXPECT ANYTHING FROM THE ELN. HE ADDED THAT HE BELIEVED THAT THIS GROUP MAKES NO EXCEPTIONS WHEN IT WANTS TO KILL SOMEONE. THE UP HAS BLAMED PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S GOVERNMENT AND THE MILITARY FOR THE ANNIHILATION CAMPAIGN AGAINST ITS MEMBERS, DEMANDING GUARANTEES FOR THEIR POLITICAL ACTIVITIES WITH LESS THAN TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE 11 MARCH LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS TAKE PLACE. THE UP MADE THE REPORT FOLLOWING THE MURDER ON 26 FEBRUARY OF APARTADO MAYOR DIANA CORDOBA SALDARRIAGA -- APARTADO IS LOCATED 480 KM TO THE NORTHEAST OF BOGOTA -- AND THE MURDER ON THE EVENING OF 27 FEBRUARY OF SIX MORE UP FOLLOWERS IN UNGUIA, A VILLAGE IN CHOCO DEPARTMENT. WHEN BLAMING THE ELN, THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER SAID THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS WANT TO BRING ANARCHY AND INSTABILITY TO THE COUNTRY. LEMOS ADDED THAT AS PART OF THE ELN'S DESTABLIZATION CAMPAIGN, IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THE MURDER PEOPLE OF OTHER LEFT-WING SECTORS AS THEIR GOAL, AND ADMITTED THAT THERE HAS BEEN A SERIES OF THREATS AGAINST VARIOUS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, INCLUDING HIMSELF. WHEN REFERRING TO THE UP'S REPORTS HOLDING THE MILITARY RESPONSIBLE, HE SAID THAT THIS WAS ABSURD AND ADDED THAT IT IS INTENDED TO LEAD THE INVESTIGATIONS ASTRAY AND TO TRY TO STOP THE ELECTIONS IN COLOMBIA.
DEV-MUC3-1147	GUATEMALA CITY, 1 MAR 90 -- GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO HAS ACCUSED U.S. AMBASSADOR THOMAS STROOK OF INTERFERING IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY. "IT IS NOT CUSTOMARY FOR AN AMBASSADOR OF ANY COUNTRY TO OPENLY INTERFERE IN THE INTERNAL PROBLEMS OF ANOTHER COUNTRY," SAID CEREZO TODAY IN REFERENCE TO THE U.S. DIPLOMAT. STROOK HAD EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN THIS WEEK OVER THE GUATEMALAN HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION AND THE GUATEMALAN OFFICIALS' INCOMPETENCE IN CONTROLLING THE SITUATION. CEREZO REQUESTED THAT STROOK DEFINE HIS STATUS, "WHETHER AS AN AMBASSADOR OR A PRIVATE PERSON." HE ALSO ASKED STROOK TO "CONSULT WITH HIS GOVERNMENT TO FIND OUT IF THIS IS AN OFFICIAL POLICY OR NOT." "IF IT IS, WE WOULD HAVE TO OPEN UP A DISCUSSION WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT," SAID THE PRESIDENT. HE ADDED THAT HE IS HANDLING THE MATTER WITH "PRUDENCE AND SENSITIVITY, BUT WITH FIRMNESS." CEREZO ALSO NOTED THAT IF STROOK "WANTS TO GIVE PERSONAL OPINIONS ABOUT GUATEMALAN PROBLEMS, HE WILL HAVE TO DO SO INDEPENDENTLY FROM HIS POSITION AS AMBASSADOR." DURING A SPEECH GIVEN TO ROTARY CLUB MEMBERS ON 27 FEBRUARY, THE U.S. AMBASSADOR CRITICIZED HOW THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT DEALT WITH THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION. THE DIPLOMAT STATED THEN: "I WOULD NOT BE SINCERE IF I TOLD YOU THAT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, CONGRESS, AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT SERIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE GUATEMALAN HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION." "THE MURDER AND KIDNAPPING OF STUDENTS, POLITICAL LEADERS, PEASANTS, AND WORKERS HAVE US DEEPLY WORRIED," HE ADDED, NOTING THAT "THE CONTINOUS REPORTS ABOUT UNKNOWN PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN MURDERED OR KIDNAPPED IN THE COUNTRY'S RURAL AREAS HAVE NOT ONLY GREATLY DISTURBED PEOPLE IN GUATEMALA, BUT ALSO THE WORLD OVER." STROOK STATED HE WAS SURPRISED THAT IN NONE OF THE CASES HAD THE GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES BEEN ABLE TO CAPTURE AND TAKE TO COURT "THE VILE AND COWARDLY CRIMINALS WHO HAD COMMITTED THESE ABOMINABLE ACTS." DURING HIS SPEECH THE DIPLOMAT ALSO CRITICIZED THE DRUG TRAFFICKING SITUATION IN GUATEMALA AND "THE SAD SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC REALITY" OF THE COUNTRY, WHERE MOST OF THE COUNTRY'S 9 MILLION INHABITANTS LIVE IN ABJECT POVERTY.
DEV-MUC3-1148	PANAMA CITY , 3 MAR 90 -- DEAR TELEVISION AUDIENCE, WE BRIEFLY INTERRUPT OUR REGULAR PROGRAMMING TO OFFER YOU A REPORT OF GENERAL INTEREST. THE FILM CLIPS WE WILL SEE IN A FEW MINUTES WERE TAKEN THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY TONIGHT AT THE RESIDENCY OF THE PERUVIAN AMBASSADOR IN BELLA VISTA CORREGIMIENTO, EL CANGREJO NEIGHBORHOOD, WHEN PEOPLE WERE STAGING A PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION PROMPTED BY THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO GRANT SAFE-CONDUCTS TO SOME OF THE PANAMANIANS CURRENTLY AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY. AMONG THE PANAMANIANS WHO SOUGHT SHELTER AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY AND WHO WERE GRANTED SAFE-CONDUCTS ARE MARCELA TASON, FORMER PRIVATE SECRETARY OF OUSTED PANAMANIAN DICTATOR MANUEL ANTONIO. CAPTAINS HERACLIDES SUCRE, AND GONZALO GONZALEZ, INVOLVED IN THE KILLING OF MAJOR MOISES GIROLDI ARE ALSO AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY. THE FILM CLIPS SHOW PART OF THE INTENSE PROTESTS THAT TOOK PLACE NEAR, OR RATHER ON THE GROUNDS OF THE RESIDENCY OF THE PERUVIAN AMBASSADOR IN PANAMA CITY. DEMONSTRATORS THREW STONES AT THE EMBASSY WINDOWS AND LATER SET FIRE TO PART OF THE RESIDENCY INSTALLATIONS. DURING THE PROTEST NOT ONE OF THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY OFFICIALS ATTEMPTED TO LEAVE THE DIPLOMATIC QUARTERS. PERUVIAN DIPLOMATS AND EVEN THE PANAMANIANS WHO SOUGHT SHELTER AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY AND WHO WERE AT THE RESIDENCY REMAINED INSIDE. PANAMANIAN PUBLIC FORCE UNITS UNSUCESSFULLY TRIED TO CONTROL DEMONSTRATORS. DURING THE INCIDENT, A PUBLIC FORCE MEMBER WHO TRIED TO PREVENT THE INCIDENT WAS SLIGHTLY INJURED. THESE SCENES WERE FILMED THIS AFTERNOON AND DURING THE EARLY EVENING HOURS BY OUR CAMERAMAN JOSE CASIS JR. AND SHOW PART OF THE PROTEST ACTIONS AGAINST THE RESIDENCY. MAJOR EDGARDO LOPEZ GRIMALDO, FORMER DEFENSE FORCES PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICER, AND THE OTHER CAPTAINS WE MENTIONED BEFORE ARE CURRENTLY AT THE RESIDENCY. LET US LISTEN TO PART OF THE STATEMENTS BY THE WIDOW OF MAJOR MOISES GIROLDI. HE TOLD US THAT HE WILL TAKE US TO FIRST VICE PRESIDENT AND JUSTICE MINISTER RICARDO ARIAS CALDERON. DID YOU AGREE TO THAT? I DO NOT WANT TO SEE ANYONE ELSE KILLED. I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE KILLED. I BELIEVE THE PRESSURE WE HAVE EXERTED IS ENOUGH. WHAT WILL BE YOUR POSITION WHEN YOU TALK TO THE MINISTER? I WANT THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT TO TAKE ACTION SO THAT THE PERUVIAN AUTHORITIES TURN THOSE PEOPLE OVER TO THE PANAMANIANS. I THINK IT IS A MATTER OF FIRMLY DEMANDING THAT THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT TURNS THIS PEOPLE OVER TO PANAMA. HOWEVER, IF THERE IS NOT A SATISFACTORY RESPONSE TODAY, BY THE AUTHORITIES AND THE GOVERNMENT, WHAT MEASURES WILL YOU ADOPT? WILL YOU CONTINUE PROTESTING? OF COURSE WE WILL CONTINUE PROTESTING. WE WILL CONTINUE PROTESTING BECAUSE THE ONLY THING WE ARE ASKING FOR IS THAT THESE PEOPLE SURRENDER TO PANAMANIAN JUSTICE SO THE LAW CAN BE ENFORCED BECAUSE THEY KILLED.... HERACLIDES SUCRE FIRED AT MY HUSBAND, HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT IT, HE MACHINEGUNNED MY HUSBAND IN COLD BLOOD. OTHER OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS WHO TOOK PART IN THE 3 OCTOBER COUP WERE TORTURED, CUT WITH MACHETES. THE FOLLOWING FILM CLIPS SHOW A DIALOGUE BETWEEN PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC GUILLERMO ENDARA, VICE PRESIDENT RICARDO ARIAS CALDERON, AND THE WIDOWS OF OFFICERS AND MILITARYMEN MISSING OR KILLED ON 3 OCTOBER 1989 IN THE ATTEMPTED COUP. THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT, THE VICE PRESIDENT, AND THE DEMONSTRATORS WAS POSITIVE. DEMONSTRATORS PROMISED TO REMAIN CALM AND WAIT UNTIL PANAMANIAN JUSTICE DETERMINES THE RESPONSIBILITY, AND ISSUE SENTENCES FOR THOSE CURRENTLY AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY. LATER ON VICE PRESIDENT RICARDO ARIAS CALDERON, AND PRESIDENT ENDARA MADE STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS. WE WILL LISTEN FIRST TO STATEMENTS BY VICE PRESIDENT RICARDO ARIAS CALDERON.
DEV-MUC3-1149	PANAMA CITY , 3 MAR 90 -- THE PRESIDENT AND MYSELF VIGOROUSLY DEPLORE WHAT TRANSPIRED THIS AFTERNOON AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY ALONG WITH THE PRESIDENT TO TALK TO MRS. GIROLDI, AND SHE ASSURED US THAT HER ONLY INTENTION WAS TO STAGE A PEACEFUL PROTEST AND AT NO TIME DID THEY PLAN TO INCLUDE ANY VIOLENT ACTS. MRS. GIROLDI SAID THAT SHE IS VERY SURPRISED THAT SOME PEOPLE WHOM SHE DOES NOT KNOW AND HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE PROMOTED VIOLENT ACTS. SHE TOLD THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC THAT SHE WILL TALK TO THE PEOPLE AND TELL THEM THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO VIOLENCE AND THAT VIOLENCE IS NOT THE AIM. THE PRESIDENT AND I APPRECIATE WHAT SHE IS DOING; WE UNDERSTAND HER PAIN. WE EXPLAINED TO HER THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT AUTHORIZED ANY SAFE-CONDUCTS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH MURDER. THOSE CASES ARE BEING TREATED DIFFERENTLY BY THE PRESIDENT AND THE MINISTER OF FOREIGN RELATIONS. IS A BREAK IN RELATIONS EXPECTED BETWEEN PANAMA AND PERU DUE TO THE VIOLENT ACTIONS? NOT AT ALL. I TALKED TO THE PERUVIAN CHARGE D'AFFAIRES AFTER OUR FOREIGN MINISTER TALKED TO HIM. HE KNOWS THAT THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT PROFOUNDLY REGRETS WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED; THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE PROTESTING THERE, SUCH AS MRS GIROLDI, HAD NO PLANS TO CARRY OUT VIOLENT ACTIONS. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE, WHOSE IDENTITY WE WILL TRY TO DETERMINE, URGED THE THROWING OF FIRE BOMBS AGAINST THE EMBASSY. THE FOREIGN MINISTER AND MYSELF EXPRESSED OUR APOLOGIES TO THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT FOR ANY INCONVENIENCES OR INSECURITY FELT BY ITS PERSONNEL. THESE ARE VERY REGRETFUL INCIDENTS. NOT ONLY A BASIC COURTESY OF CIVILIZED PEOPLE, THAT IS TO RESPECT THE RESIDENCES OF OTHER PEOPLE, AND MORE SO WHEN THEY BELONG TO REPRESENTATIVES OF OTHER COUNTRIES, BUT A PRINCIPLE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW HAS BEEN VIOLATED. THAT PRINCIPLE IS DUE RESPECT FOR DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS. WHAT REALLY WORRIES US ABOUT THIS INCIDENT IS A REPORT GIVEN TO US BY THE ORGANIZERS OF DEMONSTRATIONS AT THE EMBASSY. SPECIFICALLY, BY THE WIDOWS OF MEN MURDERED BY THOSE WHO ARE REFUGED IN THAT EMBASSY; THE WIDOW OF MAJOR GIROLDI WAS HERE, AND SHE TOLD US THAT ALL HER ACTIONS AT THE EMBASSY HAVE BEEN PEACEFUL. SHE TOLD US THAT TODAY THEY NOTICED THAT TOTALLY UNFAMILIAR PEOPLE WERE PRESENT AND THESE PEOPLE PROVOKED THE VIOLENCE; THEY INSTIGATED THE VIOLENCE. OBVIOUSLY, THERE CERTAIN GROUPS ARE SEEKING TO SPOIL OUR EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE DEMOCRACY. THEY WANT TO PREVENT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM WITH JUSTICE AND LIBERTY AT ALL COSTS. I BELIEVE THAT THIS INCIDENT MUST BE DENOUNCED BEFORE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE NATION. HE SHOULD INVESTIGATE THESE PROVOCATIONS. NEVERTHELESS, THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH URGES THE CITIZENS TO NOT ALLOW PEOPLE TO PROVOKE THEM INTO PARTICIPATING IN VIOLENT ACTIONS SUCH AS ONE WHICH OCCURRED TODAY. THE CITIZENS MUST NOT ALLOW OTHERS TO EXPLOIT THE FEELINGS THAT ALL PANAMNIANS FEEL TOWARDS CRIMINALS AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES AND WHO ARE HOLED UP IN EMBASSIES SUCH AS THIS ONE; WE URGE CITIZENS TO AVOID BEING PROVOKED.
DEV-MUC3-1150	BOGOTA, 4 MAR 90 -- THE AUTHORITIES AND SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN SURPRISED BY THE SHOCKING WAVE OF KIDNAPPINGS CARRIED OUT THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL TERRITORY BY THE SELF-STYLED ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION, ELN. OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS, THE GROUP HAS KIDNAPPED 20 PEOPLE. AMONG THE VICTIMS OF THE ELN'S SO-CALLED CAMILIST UNION ARE FOUR MAYORS, TWO DEPUTIES, SIX EXECUTIVES, CATTLEMEN, BUSINESSMEN, FARMERS, AND A POLICEMAN. ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL REPORTS, 12 KIDNAPPINGS TOOK PLACE OVER THE PAST 18 HOURS. IN CESAR DEPARTMENT, MEMBERS OF THE CAMILIST UNION KIDNAPPED LIBERAL DEPUTY DARIO QUINTERO PATINO, 42, IN THE DOWNTOWN SECTION OF AGUACHICA MUNICIPALITY. NEWSMAN EMILIANO J. PACHECO, WHO WORKS FOR THE "ADVANCES OF CESAR" NEWSCAST OF THE ONDAS DEL CESAR RADIO STATION, WAS KIDNAPPED ALONG WITH THE POLITICAL LEADER. EARLY ON SATURDAY MORNING, A GANG OF KIDNAPPERS, APPARENTLY ELN MEMBERS, KIDNAPPED CATTLEMAN MANUEL NARCISO MARTINEZ JAROCA, NEPHEW OF ANIBAL MARTINEZ ZURETA, CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR OF VALLEDUPAR AND FORMER COMPTROLLER GENERAL OF THE REPUBLIC. IN ADDITION, CELINA OSSA DE GOMEZ, CONSERVATIVE PARTY LEADER AND DEPUTY, WAS KIDNAPPED IN DOWNTOWN GRANADA, ANTIOQUIA. IN TIBU, NORTE DE SANTANDER, MAYOR EDUARDO ROLON DIAZ AND MAYORAL CANDIDATE ALVARO SARMIENTO HERRERA WERE ALSO KIDNAPPED BY THE SO-CALLED ELN CAMILIST UNION. THE TWO MEN WERE ON THEIR WAY TO LUNCH WHEN THEY WERE TAKEN BY SURPRISE BY THE REBELS. AT NOON YESTERDAY, NEAR SAVANA DE TORRES, SANTANDER, ALVARO TORRES, AN EMPLOYEE OF THE AGRARIAN FUND; OSCAR CELIO TORRES GUTIERREZ, A SPOKESMAN FOR INCORA ; MIGUEL CACEL, AN IMAT OFFICIAL; AND A WORKER FROM PEDIAROZ WERE KIDNAPPED. THE ELN IS ALSO HOLDING NOEL FRANCISCO ACEVEDO AND JAVIER IGNACIO PENA, THE MAYORS OF EL CARMEN AND CALIFORNIA, SANTANDER, RESPECTIVELY; AND LIBERAL PARTY DEPUTY JUAN CARLOS DUARTE, WHO WAS ABDUCTED BY THE ELN ON TENERIFE ROAD, IN THE MUNICIPAL JURISDICTION OF CONCEPCION. DUARTE IS A DEPUTY FOR THE RENOVATION OF FREE SANTANDER LIBERAL PARTY. ALONG THE ROAD FROM SAN VICENTE TO EL CARMEN, ALSO IN SANTANDER, GONZALO VASQUEZ ARDILA, MANAGER OF THE LOCAL AGRARIAN FUND, AND OLINDO MANTILLA ARDILA, A DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY, WERE ALSO KIDNAPPED. THE TWO MEN WERE IN AN AUTOMOBILE WITH LICENSE PLATE UF-2171 WHEN THEY WERE ABDUCTED BY THE GUERRILLAS. THE DRIVER, MARCO TULIO GOMEZ, WAS ALSO KIDNAPPED, BUT RELEASED SEVERAL HOURS LATER. HERNANDO TORRES JAIMES, MAYOR OF HACARI, NORTE DE SANTANDER, IS ALSO IN THE HANDS OF THE ELN. IN CORDOBA, CATTLEMAN GERMAN SIERRA MEDINA WAS KIDNAPPED ALONG THE EL TORO ROAD OF PIEDRA ALTA. IN CANALETE, ALSO IN CORDOBA, CATTLEMAN PEDRO PABLO MEJIA WAS KIDNAPPED. HE WAS AT THE LA CANA ESTATE WHEN THE GUERRILLAS KIDNAPPED HIM. IN PEDREGALES, ON THE ROAD FROM ZULIA TO SARDINATA, THE ELN KIDNAPPED BUSINESSMAN SERGIO ALARCON. IN EL CENTENARIO, EL CARMEN, SANTANDER, MEMBERS OF THE CAMILIST UNION KIDNAPPED LANDOWNER SAMUEL PLAZAS. THE AUTHORITIES ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT POLICEMAN EDISON AGUDELO AGUDELO WAS KIDNAPPED BY MEMBERS OF THE CAMILIST UNION AS HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO FRAGUAS CORREGIMIENTO IN REMEDIOS, ANTIOQUIA, TO CASH A CHECK. THE AUTHORITIES AND SECRET SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS ANNOUNCED THAT INTENSIVE OPERATIONS ARE UNDERWAY IN AN EFFORT TO RESCUE THE HOSTAGES ALIVE. AT THE SAME TIME, THEY URGED LOCAL OFFICIALS AND POLITICAL LEADERS TO REFRAIN FROM TRAVELLING ALONE TO AVOID FALLING INTO THE HANDS OF THE GUERRILLAS. WITH THIS SHOCKING WAVE OF KIDNAPPINGS, THE NUMBER OF SUCH ACTIONS IN COLOMBIA SO FAR IN 1990 HAS INCREASED TO 120.
DEV-MUC3-1151	CLANDESTINE, 6 MAR 90 -- ONE MILITARY HELICOPTER WAS SHOT DOWN TODAY WHILE ANOTHER ONE WAS DAMAGED IN QUEBRANDA HONDA NEAR CHALATENANGO CITY. THEREFORE, THE FMLN WISHES TO INFORM OUR PEOPLE OF THE FOLLOWING: 1. THE ANTI-AIRCRAFT CLASH TOOK PLACE DURING A MILITARY OPERATION WHICH THE DM-1 IS CARRYING OUT IN THAT SECTOR. 2. EARLY IN THE MORNING WE FOUGHT WITH DM-1 TROOPS, WHO WERE SUPPORTED BY SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS. 3. WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK, OUR ANTI-AIRCRAFT UNITS FIRED ON TWO MILITARY HELICOPTERS THAT HAD FIRED ROCKETS AND MACHINEGUNNED THE AREA. OUR UNITS SHOT DOWN ONE AND SERIOUSLY DAMAGED ANOTHER HELICOPTER. 4. THESE ACTIONS TOOK PLACE NEAR THE CAPITAL OF CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT, AND NOT NEAR THE GUANCORA LAND SETTLEMENT. 5. LATER, WE LEARNED FROM PUBLIC REPORTS THAT ONE OF THE HELICOPTERS WAS CARRYING A TEAM OF JOURNALISTS AND ATTORNEY GENERAL MAURICIO COLORADO ALONG WITH THE TROOPS. TO THAT EFFECT, WE REGRET THE INJURIES INFLICTED ON THE JOURNALISTS, TO WHOM WE REITERATE OUR RECOMMENDATION THAT THEY SHOULD NOT TRAVEL ON ANY MILITARY VEHICLES OR AIRCRAFT. WE EXTEND THIS WARNING TO ALL CIVILIANS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.
DEV-MUC3-1152	SAN SALVADOR, 6 MAR 90 -- ONE SOLDIER WAS KILLED AND SIX MORE PERSONS WERE INJURED, INCLUDING THREE NEWSMEN, IN AN ATTACK AGAINST A HELICOPTER IN WHICH ATTORNEY GENERAL MAURICIO COLORADO WAS ONE OF THE PASSENGERS, OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE NOTED, ADDING THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS UNHURT. ACCORDING TO THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE , MEMBERS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT MACHINEGUNNED THE HELICOPTER AS IT WAS FLYING TO THE TOWN OF GUANCORITA IN NORTHERN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT. THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE WHEN THE HELICOPTER WAS FLYING LOW CLOSE TO ITS DESTINATION, IN AN AREA WITH A HEAVY GUERRILLA PRESENCE, THE MILITARY SOURCES SAID. THE SAME SOURCES ADDED THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND HIS RETINUE WERE GOING TO BE PRESENT AT THE DISINTERMENT OF THE BODIES OF THE VICTIMS OF AN AIR FORCE BOMBING IN THAT DEPARTMENT THREE WEEKS AGO. THE SOURCES DID NOT INDICATE THE PRECISE NUMBER OF PERSONS TRAVELING ABOARD THE HELICOPTER, BUT DID SAY THAT THE CONDITION OF FOUR OF THE SIX PERSONS INJURED, TWO SOLDIERS AND TWO NEWSMEN, WAS SERIOUS. THE WOUNDED REPORTERS ARE CAMERAMAN MANUEL DIAZ AND SOUND MAN WILLIAM MADRID, OF LOCAL TELEVISION STATION TELECORPORACION SALVADORENA .
DEV-MUC3-1153	SAN SALVADOR, 6 MAR 90 -- MILITARY SOURCES REPORTED TODAY THAT FIGHTING BROKE OUT ON THE NIGHT OF 5 MARCH IN THE WAR-TORN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT TO THE NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR, WHERE THE GUERRILLAS SUFFERED EIGHT CASUALTIES. THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE REPORTED THAT THE CLASHES TOOK PLACE NEAR SAN ISIDRO LABRADOR, WHERE THREE GUERRILLAS WERE KILLED AND FIVE OTHERS WERE WOUNDED. THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT , WHICH HAS BEEN FIGHTING THE U.S.-BACKED ARMY FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS, HAS TRADITIONALLY MAINTAINED A HIGH PROFILE IN STRATEGIC AREAS OF CHALATENANGO. MEANWHILE, URBAN GUERRILLA COMMANDOS HARASSED TROOPS BELONGING TO THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE LAST NIGHT AT THE MARIONA PENITENTIARY, LOCATED ON THE NORTHERN OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR, APPARENTLY LEAVING NO CASUALTIES. ATLACATL BATTALION TROOPS, WHICH MAINTAIN A COUNTERINSURGENCY OPERATION AT THE FOOTHILLS OF GUAZAPA HILL, TO THE NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR, CONFISCATED WAR MATERIEL THAT THE GUERRILLAS HAD HIDDEN UNDERGROUND. IN ANOTHER TURN OF EVENTS, FMLN SAPPERS WHO CONTINUOUSLY SABOTAGE THE ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEM DESTROYED SEVERAL HIGH-VOLTAGE POSTS IN LA LIBERTAD AND CABANAS DEPARTMENTS IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY, AND IN USULUTAN DEPARTMENT IN THE SOUTHEASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. THERE WERE WIDESPREAD POWER OUTAGES IN THE THREE DEPARTMENTS WHILE TECHNICIANS OF THE STATE-RUN ELECTRIC POWER COMPANIES REPAIRED THE DAMAGE. THE ARMY AND SECURITY CORPS DEPLOYED HEAVY PATROLS IN SAN SALVADOR AND IN CITIES IN THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR TO TRY AND COUNTER THE WAVE OF ATTACKS.
DEV-MUC3-1154	GUATEMALA CITY, 6 MAR 90 -- NOW, JUST LIKE 13 YEARS AGO WHEN A DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION WAS INSTALLED IN THE WHITE HOUSE, THE RELATIONS BETWEEN GUATEMALA AND THE UNITED STATES ARE PARTICULARLY TENSE, AND TODAY, JUST LIKE THEN, THE REASON FOR THE TENSION IN THEIR BILATERAL RELATIONS IS THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION, BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO THE REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION OF GEORGE BUSH, THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT OF VINICIO CEREZO DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE ENOUGH POLITICAL WILL TO NEUTRALIZE THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE AFFECTING THE SECURITY OF CITIZENS AND INDIVIDUAL GUARANTEES. IN MARCH 1977, NEWLY INSTALLED U.S. PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER DEMANDED THAT THE REGIME HEADED BY GENERAL KJELL LAUGERUD RECTIFY A DOMESTIC POLICY THAT, ACCORDING TO THE WHITE HOUSE, WAS CHARACTERIZED BY REPRESSIVE PRACTICES AGAINST THE OPPOSITION AND PEASANT AND LABOR GROUPS. THE GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES REACTED BY REJECTING U.S. MILITARY AID. THE SAME POSITION WAS ADOPTED, AMID VERY SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES, BY THE MILITARY GOVERNMENTS OF JORGE VIDELA IN ARGENTINA AND AUGUSTO PINOCHET IN CHILE. RELATIONS BETWEEN GUATEMALA AND WASHINGTON CONTINUED TO BE TORTUOUS DURING THE BALANCE OF THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION AND ONLY IMPROVED, RELATIVELY SPEAKING, WHEN REPUBLICAN RONALD REAGAN TOOK OFFICE IN 1981. HOWEVER, ONLY YEARS LATER -- WITH THE COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRATIZATION BY DE FACTO MILITARY GOVERNMENTS THAT LED THE COUNTRY FROM 1982 AND 1985 -- WAS THERE A CONCILIATORY ATTITUDE BETWEEN GUATEMALA AND THE UNITED STATES THAT BROUGHT ABOUT QUITE HARMONIOUS RELATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENTS OF PRESIDENT CEREZO AND PRESIDENTS REAGAN AND BUSH UNTIL MID-1989. ON 27 FEBRUARY U.S. AMBASSADOR THOMAS STROOK CRITICIZED THE GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES' FAILURE TO PURSUE THE AUTHORS OF MURDERS AND OF KIDNAPPINGS OF POLITICAL, STUDENT, AND LABOR LEADERS, AND THUS WORSENED AN ATMOSPHERE OF CONFRONTATION THAT HAD RESURFACED ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO WHEN AMBASSADOR STROOK, WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED IN GUATEMALA, OBJECTED TO THE APPOINTMENT OF COLONEL HUGO MORAN CARRANZA, FORMER DIRECTOR OF ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROL, TO THE POST OF MANAGER OF THE SANTO TOMAS DE CASTILLA PORT ENTERPRISE. THE AMBASSADOR JUSTIFIED HIS OBJECTION BY CLAIMING THAT ASPECTS RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL DRUG TRAFFICKING HAD TO BE RESOLVED FIRST. ON 6 MARCH, PRESIDENT CEREZO SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES HAD HARDENED ITS ATTITUDE TOWARD THE GUATEMALAN REGIME AND THAT THIS ATTITUDE CONTRASTS WITH A TOLERANT POSTURE EXHIBITED TOWARD PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS IN GUATEMALA: THEY HAVE HARSHLY CRITICIZED THE COURTS SITUATION. THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE AND AS A RESULT OF THE UN ACTION A DRAFT PROCEDURAL LAW WILL BE SUBMITTED. THIS SHOULD BE APPROVED AND PROCEEDINGS SHOULD IMPROVE IN GUATEMALA IN ABOUT YEARS. HOWEVER, WE ARE DEALING WITH LONG-TERM EFFORT. WE HAVE MADE INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES FOR ONLY FOUR YEARS. I SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT THE U.S. ATTITUDE TOWARD A COUNTRY THAT IS MAKING EFFORTS TO MOVE FORWARD IS UNFAIR AND OVERLY CRITICAL. IT IS BEING MORE CRITICAL OF THE CURRENT GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT THAN IT EVER WAS TOWARD PAST DICTATORSHIPS. THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLY HARSHER IN CRITICIZING THE CURRENT GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT DEMOCRACY THAN PAST DICTATORIAL GOVERNMENTS, TO WHICH THE UNITED STATES, IN CERTAIN CASES, WAS AN ACCOMPLICE BY SAYING NOTHING . ONLY HOURS AFTER THE PRESIDENT MADE THESE STATEMENTS, THE U.S. EMBASSY IN GUATEMALA ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE STATING THAT IF THE UNITED STATES ABSTAINED FROM VOICING ITS CONCERN OVER HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, IT WOULD INDEED BE ACTING AS AN ACCOMPLICE. THE COMMUNIQUE CITES STATEMENTS MADE ON 5 MARCH IN WASHINGTON BY STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESWOMAN MARGARET TUTWILLER THAT U.S. AMBASSADOR STROOK, IN HIS CAPACITY AS PRESIDENT BUSH'S PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE, HAS ON MANY OCCASIONS TOLD TOP GUATEMALAN OFFICIALS, IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE, THAT THOSE WHO COMMIT VIOLENT ACTS MUST BE TURNED OVER TO JUSTICE. STROOK IS CURRENTLY IN WASHINGTON WHERE HE WAS RECALLED BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT FOR CONSULTATIONS. ACCORDING TO THE DIPLOMATIC MISSION, THE AMBASSADOR'S STATEMENTS ACCURATELY REFLECT THE PERMANENT U.S. POSITION OF CONSIDERING HUMAN RIGHTS AS AN ISSUE THAT MUST BE TREATED AT AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL.
DEV-MUC3-1155	SANTIAGO, 6 MAR 90 -- CHILEAN PRESIDENT-ELECT PATRICIO AYLWIN TODAY CONDITIONED THE REESTABLISHMENT OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH CUBA TO THAT COUNTRY'S SUSPENSION OF ITS MILITARY, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SUPPORT TO CHILE'S MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT TERRORIST GROUP. IN REMARKS TO EFE, AYLWIN EXPRESSED HIS SATISFACTION OVER THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO ATTEND THE CHILEAN PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION ON 11 MARCH. HE ALSO NOTED THAT LA PAZ MUST FIRST RESTORE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH CHILE TO HOLD TALKS ON BOLIVIA'S DESIRE FOR AN OUTLET TO THE SEA. AYLWIN STATED THAT CUBA'S SUSPENSION OF ITS SUPPORT TO THE FPMR IS "A SINE QUA NON CONDITION" FOR RESUMING RELATIONS, WHICH WERE SEVERED IN 1973 IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE MILITARY COUP IN CHILE. "WE WANT TO MAINTAIN RELATIONS WITH EVERY COUNTRY," THE CHILEAN PRESIDENT-ELECT TOLD EFE. HE ADDED: "IT WOULD BE VERY GOOD FOR LATIN AMERICA IF CUBA COULD EFFECTIVELY REJOIN US AT THIS TIME IN WHICH, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS, PERHAPS IN DECADES, THERE WILL BE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT THE CONTINENT." AYLWIN ADDED: "WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK CUBA TO MAKE IT QUITE CLEAR THAT IT WILL REFRAIN FROM ANY ACT OF INTERFERENCE AND FROM SUPPLYING ANY AID TO CHILEAN TERRORIST GROUPS." THE FPMR, WHICH EMERGED IN DECEMBER 1983, IS MADE UP OF MILITANTS FROM COMMUNIST YOUTH GROUPS AND OTHER EXTREME LEFT ORGANIZATIONS AND YOUNG EXILES WHO HAVE RETURNED TO THE COUNTRY. THE FPMR MADE HEADLINES IN AUGUST 1986 WITH THE DISCOVERY OF AN ARSENAL THAT HAD BEEN CLANDESTINELY SHIPPED INTO NORTHERN CHILE. THE FPMR WAS ALSO IN THE NEWS WITH THE UNSUCCESSFUL 7 SEPTEMBER 1986 ATTACK ON CHILE'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE, GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET, WHICH CLAIMED THE LIVES OF FIVE OF PINOCHET'S BODYGUARDS. AYLWIN ALSO STATED THAT THE REESTABLISHMENT OF DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH BOLIVIA "IS BLOCKED BY THE BOLIVIAN DECISION TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH OUR COUNTRY." COMMENTING ON BOLIVIA'S ASPIRATION FOR AN OUTLET TO THE SEA, AYLWIN SAID: "WE CANNOT ACCEPT CONDITIONS FOR THE REESTABLISHMENT OF RELATIONS. IF WE HAVE RELATIONS, WE CAN TALK ABOUT ANYTHING AND FIND SOLUTIONS TO ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS." AYLWIN CONTINUED: "IF WE DO NOT MAINTAIN RELATIONS, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO HOLD A DIALOGUE." AYLWIN ALSO COMMENTED ON PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA'S DECISION TO ATTEND THE CHILEAN PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION. THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN 100 YEARS THAT A PERUVIAN PRESIDENT WILL VISIT CHILE, A GESTURE WITH "HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE" FOR AYLWIN. THE LEGACY OF THE CHILEAN-PERUVIAN WAR HAS NOT YET DISAPPEARED DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE TWO COUNTRIES SHARE COMMON INTERESTS AND HAVE MAINTAINED FRIENDLY RELATIONS IN RECENT YEARS. AYLWIN DESCRIBED THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT'S PLAN TO ATTEND HIS INAUGURATION "AS A GESTURE WHICH, IN ADDITION TO GREATLY HONORING ME, I MUST SEE AS VERY PROMISING FOR RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES." COUNTRY IS WILLING TO PARTICIPATE "IN EVERY STAGE." COMMENTING SPECIFICALLY ON THE GROUP OF EIGHT, AYLWIN NOTED THAT THIS GROUP MAY BECOME A LARGER LATIN AMERICAN ORGANIZATION. IN AYLWIN'S OPINION, THE GROUP OF EIGHT -- WHICH IS MADE UP OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, COLOMBIA, MEXICO, PERU, URUGUAY, VENEZUELA, AND PANAMA -- EMERGED PRIMARILY TO SUPPORT DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENTS IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES. NOW THAT DEMOCRACY HAS SPREAD TO VIRTUALLY ALL LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, THE GROUP OF EIGHT COULD BECOME "THE SEED FOR A BROADER ORGANIZATION, BECAUSE THE REASONS THAT PREVENTED OTHER COUNTRIES FROM JOINING HAVE GRADUALLY DISAPPEARED."
DEV-MUC3-1156	BOGOTA, 8 MAR 90 -- THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT , ONE OF THE MAIN COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA ORGANIZATIONS, DELIVERED THEIR WEAPONS TODAY TO A SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL SPECIAL COMMISSION AT THE M-19 CAMP LOCATED IN THE MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHWESTERN COLOMBIA. THE DELIVERY BEGAN AT 1030 LOCAL TIME AND PROCEEDED FOR A FEW HOURS BEFORE THE PRESS WAS PERMITTED ACCESS TO THE CAMP. THE DELIVERY OF THE WEAPONS, WITH WHICH THE GUERRILLA GROUP HAS FOUGHT DURING THE PAST 16 YEARS, TOOK PLACE TWO DAYS BEFORE THE POLITICAL PACT OR THE DEFINITIVE PEACE AGREEMENT BY THE M-19 AND COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S GOVERNMENT WAS SIGNED. BEFORE SURRENDERING THEIR WEAPONS, THE M-19 GUERRILLAS SHOT THEM INTO THE AIR FOR THE LAST TIME. THEN THEY GAVE THEIR WEAPONS TO THEIR TOP LEADER, CARLOS PIZARRO, WHO DELIVERED THEM TO THE IS COMMISSION, MADE UP OF VENEZUELAN, SWISS, BRITISH, AND FINNISH MILITARY PERSONNEL. THE IS COMMISSION, A PRESIDENTIAL REPRESENTATIVE, 600 M-19 MEMBERS, AND OVER 200 LOCAL AND FOREIGN NEWSMEN WITNESSED THE WEAPON DELIVERY CEREMONY AT PEACE VILLAGE IN SANTO DOMINGO, CAUCA DEPARTMENT, 400 KM SOUTHWEST OF BOGOTA.
DEV-MUC3-1157	SAN SALVADOR, 8 MAR 90 -- HERE IS AN EXCERPT OF WHAT AN OFFICIAL REPORT BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE, ARENA, REGARD AS A COMPLETELY RECKLESS PUBLICATION AND WITHOUT ANY CREDIBILITY. THE COMMUNIQUE IS BY THE SO-CALLED DEATH SQUADS, AND AN EXCERPT OF IT RELEASED A FEW HOURS AGO THROUGH VARIOUS LOCAL AND FOREIGN MEDIA READS AS FOLLOWS: TO THE NEWS MEDIA, POLITICAL PARTIES, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, UNIONS, WORKERS, PEASANT ORGANIZATIONS, AND DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS: THE UNDERSIGNED, SUPREME COMMANDERS OF THE DEATH SQUADS WHO MET ON 13 FEBRUARY SOMEWHERE IN SAN SALVADOR IN AN EXTRAORDINARY ASSEMBLY AND WHO REPRESENT ALL OUR CHAPTERS AND CADRES SCATTERED IN THE COUNTRY'S 14 DEPARTMENTS, STRONGLY AND MANFULLLY DECLARE: SENTENCE UNFINISHED AS HEARD THE DOCUMENT, WITH PARAGRAPHS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE AUTHORS, STATES THAT THE OFFICERS AND ENLISTED MEN INVOLVED IN THE JESUITS' MURDERS MUST BE RELEASED BEFORE HOLY WEEK, OR ELSE THEY WILL PHYSICALLY ELIMINATE ALL CIVILIAN AND RELIGIOUS PERSONNEL, INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE GOVERNMENT, WHO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS CASE. THE COMMUNIQUE NOTES: NEVER BEFORE IN THE HISTORY OF EL SALVADOR HAS ANY OFFICER BEEN TRIED, AND AS WE HAVE LEARNED, NO SOLDIER HAS BEEN, AND MUST NOT BE, SUBJECT TO ANY LAW OF THE REPUBLIC. IT ADDS: KEEP IN MIND, LEST WE BEGIN TO CARRY OUT REPRISALS, THAT THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY WE HAVE ALWAYS GONE UNPUNISHED, A PRIVILEGE THAT WE ARE NOT READY TO LOSE. A STATEMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT AND ARENA, WHICH ARE MENTIONED IN THE COMMUNIQUE, TOTALLY REJECTED THE DOCUMENT THAT, WE REPEAT, WAS DISTRIBUTED IN SAN SALVADOR A FEW HOURS AGO. IN A WARNING TO THE NEWS MEDIA, THE AUTHORS SAY THAT THE MEDIA ARE OBLIGATED TO MAKE THIS COMMUNIQUE KNOWN, OR ELSE THEIR INSTALLATIONS AND STAFF WILL SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR DISOBEDIENCE. THE AUTHORS OF THE COMMUNIQUE ALSO REFER TO A NEWSPAPER THAT THEY REGARD AS THEIR OFFICIAL MOUTHPIECE, AND THEY WARN THAT, FOR THE GOOD AND SECURITY OF THE COUNTRY AND THE FATHERLAND, THIS NEWSPAPER MUST BE CLEARER IN IDENTIFYING PEOPLE AND FIGURES WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN JUDGED AND CONDEMNED IN ORDER TO CAPTURE AND DESTROY THEM. MEANWHILE, TERMING THE COMMUNIQUE AS RECKLESS AND THE ENTIRE SITUATION AS DESPICABLE, THE GOVERNMENT AND ARENA REJECT ANY TIES TO ANY DEATH SQUADS. THE COMMUNIQUE BY THE SELF-STYLED DEATH SQUADS IS SIGNED BY AQUILES BAIRES , THE MAXIMILIANO HERNANDEZ MARTINEZ SQUAD , THE ALLIANCE OF ANTICOMMUNIST ACTION , AND THE COMMITTEE FOR THE SALVATION OF THE FATHERLAND COMITE PRO SALVACION DE LA PATRIA.
DEV-MUC3-1158	SAN SALVADOR, 8 MAR 90 -- GOOD EVENING, LISTENERS. IN ORDER TO BRING CALM TO ALL SAN SALVADOR RESIDENTS, AND ALSO TO PEOPLE LIVING IN THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY, WE INFORM YOU THAT A FEW MINUTES AGO, EXPERTS OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY OF EL SALVADOR, CAES, CONFIRMED THAT DESPITE A FEW ATTACKS ON SOME POWER TOWERS, ENERGY SERVICE IS COMPLETELY NORMAL THROUGHOUT SAN SALVADOR. THE CAES EXPERTS ADDED THAT THERE WAS A SHORT POWER OUTAGE IN LARGE PARTS OF SAN SALVADOR, BUT THAT THE SITUATION IS BACK TO NORMAL NOW. THE EXPERTS SAID THAT THEY ALSO DETECTED SOME DAMAGE IN THE ENERGY SYSTEM. AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ON THIS RADIO STATION EARLIER, HARASSMENT OPERATIONS WERE CARRIED OUT IN SEVERAL PARTS OF SAN SALVADOR AT APPROXIMATELY 2115 TONIGHT. FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT LEFTIST GUERRILLAS ATTACKED MILITARY POSITIONS IN SAN RAMON, AYUTUXTEPEQUE, MEJICANOS, AND CUSCATANCINGO TONIGHT. IT WAS SAID THAT A NUMBER OF FMLN MEMBERS CONDUCTED LIGHTNING ATTACKS ON THOSE MILITARY POSITIONS AND THEN WITHDREW FROM THE AREA IMMEDIATELY. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE ATTACK IN SAN RAMON LASTED APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES, AFTER WHICH THE ARMY TOOK CONTROL OF THAT ENTIRE AREA. REPORTS STATE THAT AFTER THE ATTACK IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE THE GUERRILLAS MOVED TOWARD EL CARMEN HILL AND COUNTERINSURGENCY BATTALION MEMBERS WERE PURSUING THE REBEL COLUMNS THERE. IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT THE REBELS ATTACKED MILITARY POSITIONS IN CUSCATANCINGO AND ON EL FITO STREET, MEJICANOS JURISDICTION. A FEW MINUTES AGO IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE SHOOTING ENDED IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE AND IN THE OTHER PARTS OF NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, AND THAT AN AIR FORCE HELICOPTER IS OVERFLYING THE AREA TO COUNTERACT THE REBELS' MOVEMENT. IT WAS ALSO CONFIRMED THAT ENERGY HAS BEEN RESTORED IN SOME PARTS OF SAN SALVADOR, BUT NOT IN CUSCATANCINGO AND CIUDAD DELGADO, WHERE THE GUERRILLAS BLEW UP SEVERAL POWER TOWERS. THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE HAS ONLY STATED THAT NO CASUALTIES ARE REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THESE HARASSMENT OPERATIONS, ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA OF AYUTUXTEPEQUE. COPREFA INDICATED THAT 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE MEMBERS HAVE ALREADY TAKEN STRATEGIC POSITIONS THROUGHOUT NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR AND THAT THESE MEN ARE SUPPORTED BY SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS, WHICH ARE LIGHTING THE AREA WITH SPOTLIGHTS AND FLARES. ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL REPORT, THE SITUATION AT THIS TIME IS COMPLETELY NORMAL IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, DESPITE THE PANIC THAT SPREAD AT APPROXIMATELY 2115 WHEN HEAVY SHOOTING, MACHINEGUN FIRE, AND THE DETONATION OF POWERFUL BOMBS WERE HEARD. NEITHER COPREFA NOR THE SPECIFIC MILITARY POSITIONS THAT WERE ATTACKED HAVE REPORTED CASUALTIES SO FAR. IT WAS SAID THAT TOMORROW MORNING COPREFA WILL ISSUE AN OVERALL REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF THESE CLASHES. SALVADORAN RED CROSS SOURCES SAID TONIGHT THAT THEY DO NOT KNOW OF ANY CIVILIAN CASUALTY RESULTING FROM THESE ARMED INCIDENTS. THIS HAS BEEN A REPORT ON THE ATTACKS CARRIED OUT IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR TONIGHT. WE INVITE YOU TO JOIN US TOMORROW FOR A REPORT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVENTS.
DEV-MUC3-1159	SAN SALVADOR, 8 MAR 90 -- SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS ACCUSED THE GUERRILLAS OF MAINTAINING "INFLEXIBLE STANDS" REGARDING RESUMING THE DIALOGUE THAT WILL ALLOW ENDING THE 10-YEAR-OLD ARMED CONFLICT. IN AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT TODAY, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI SAID THAT "THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT DOES NOT WANT TO LISTEN TO THE CRIES OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE REJECTING VIOLENCE." FOR CRISTIANI, THE FMLN "IS THE ONLY PARTY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TERRORIST ACTIONS, AS IT MAINTAINS INFLEXIBLE STANDS" ABOUT THE PEACE PROCESS. THE REBELS, WHO ROSE UP IN ARMS 10 YEARS AGO, RECENTLY SAID THAT AS LONG AS THERE IS NO TRUE ATTEMPT TO BRING ABOUT A DEMOCRATIZATION, ITS ARMED STRUGGLE "CONTINUES BEING AS LEGITIMATE AS IT WAS 10 YEARS AGO." FOLLOWING THE NOVEMBER 1989 OFFENSIVE, THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN ASKED UN SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR TO INTERCEDE AND SEEK AN AGREEMENT THAT WILL BRING ABOUT THE PEACE TALKS. HEEDING THIS REQUEST, PEREZ DE CUELLAR APPOINTED DIPLOMAT ALVARO DE SOTO AS HIS PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE. AS OF LAST DECEMBER, DE SOTO HAS BEEN MEETING WITH BOTH PARTIES, THE CHURCH, AND SALVADORAN POLITICAL SECTORS. THE CRISTIANI STATEMENT TERMS AS "FALSE" THE CHARGES RAISED BY THE FMLN TO THE EFFECT THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HINDERING THE RESUMPTION OF THE PEACE EFFORTS. "PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HAS REITERATED TO MR. DE SOTO A TRUE WILLINGNESS TO SEEK THROUGH A SERIOUS DIALOGUE AND NOT A TACTICAL OR MUCH LESS PROPAGANDISTIC DIALOGUE THE SOLUTION TO THE ARMED CONFLICT," THE DOCUMENT POINTS OUT. THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT THANKED DE SOTO'S "INTEREST AND HARD WORK" IN COMPLYING WITH THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL'S COMMITMENT OF SEEKING PEACE IN THE COUNTRY.
DEV-MUC3-1160	SAN SALVADOR, 9 MAR 90 -- IT HAS JUST BEEN REPORTED TO US THAT ALL FIGHTING STOPPED IN SANTIAGO DE MARIA AT 0100 AND THAT, AS OF APPROXIMATELY 0615, WHEN THIS REPORTED IS BEING FILED, THERE HAS BEEN NO MORE FIRING IN THE AREA. THERE HAD BEEN HEAVY RIFLE FIRE AND BOMBINGS UP UNTIL 0100.
DEV-MUC3-1161	BOGOTA, 8 MAR 90 -- IT HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED THAT COLOMBIAN AND VENEZUELAN AUTHORITIES DEALT A HARSH BLOW TO THE GUERRILLA ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION WHEN, IN A BORDER REGION, THEY BROKE UP A REBEL COLUMN THAT OPERATED IN BOTH COUNTRIES. THE MILITARY OPERATIVE LED TO THE CAPTURE OF 12 ELN MEMBERS WHO HAD KIDNAPPED SEVERAL CATTLE BREEDERS AND PROPERTY-OWNERS IN THE BORDER AREA. ONE OF THE GUERILLAS, ROBERTO ALBARRACIN RODRIGUEZ, WAS CAPTURED IN THE VENEZUELAN TOWN OF RUASDUALITO BY MEMBERS OF THE VENEZUELAN JUDICIAL TECHNICAL POLICE , WHILE COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES CAPTURED 11 OTHERS IN THE EASTERN ARAUCA DEPARTMENT. THE ELN, THE MOST RADICAL OF ALL THE ARMED GROUPS OPERATING IN COLOMBIA, HAS THREATENED TO SABOTAGE NEXT SUNDAY'S MUNICIPAL AND LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS. OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, ELN FRONTS HAVE KIDNAPPED SEVERAL MAYORS, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND CATTLE BREEDERS, AND THEY HAVE STOLEN PEASANTS' IDENTITY CARDS, WITHOUT WHICH THEY CANNOT VOTE.
DEV-MUC3-1162	NO CITY, NO DATE -- COLOMBIA: DRUG KINGPINS SOLE MEMBERS OF 'EXTRADITABLES' THE 22 JANUARY EDITION OF THE BOGOTA DAILY EL TIEMPO PUBLISHED INFORMATION FROM COLOMBIAN POLICE INTELLIGENCE REPORTS AND STATE SECURITY INTERCEPTS IDENTIFYING DRUG KINGPINS PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA AND JORGE LUIS OCHOA VASQUE AS THE ONLY MEMBERS OF THE SO-CALLED "EXTRADITABLES." THIS PRESS NOTE PROVIDES HIGHLIGHTS OF THE 22 JANUARY ARTICLE. DRUG BARONS PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA AND JORGE LUIS OCHOA VASQUE, WHO ARE REPUTED TO BE THE BRAINS BEHIND THE MEDELLIN CARTEL'S PLAN TO SURRENDER TO THE GOVERNMENT, HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE NATIONAL POLICE AND STATE SECURITY AS THE ONLY ONES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMMUNIQUES SENT BY THE SO-CALLED "EXTRADITABLES," ACCORDING TO THE EL TIEMPO ARTICLE. STATE SECURITY RECOGNI ED ESCOBAR'S VOICE IN A CONVERSATION INTERCEPTED DURING A ROUTINE RADIO SCANNING OPERATION, WHICH REVEALED THAT THE CARTEL WAS PLANNING TO SURRENDER TO THE GOVERNMENT. ESCOBAR WAS ACTING AS THE CARTEL'S INTERMEDIARY IN CHARGE OF CONTACTING LAWYER GUIDO PARRA, THE LIAISON BETWEEN THE CARTEL AND HIGH LEVEL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. ESCOBAR DID NOT DISCLOSE THE NAMES OF THE OFFICIALS INVOLVED. A NATIONAL POLICE INTELLIGENCE REPORT SAYS THAT OCHOA AND ESCOBAR FIND THEMSELVES IN A PRECARIOUS SITUATION BECAUSE OTHER TRAFFICKER GROUPS HAVE WITHDRAWN THEIR SUPPORT AS THEY DO NOT WANT TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR KIDNAPPINGS AND OTHER TERRORIST ACTS THEY HAVE NOT PERPETRATED. THE REPORT FURTHER INDICATES THAT ESCOBAR, PRESSURED BY MILITARY OPERATIONS IN ANTIOQUIA, "WAS FORCED TO ORDER THE KIDNAPPINGS OF ALVARO DIEGO MONTOYA, AND PATRICIA ECHEVARRIA AND HER DAUGHTER." THESE HIGH PROFILE HOSTAGES SERVED AS A "PROTECTIVE SHIELD," ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE. SPOKESMEN FOR THE INTELLIGENCE CORPS ARE QUOTED AS SAYING THAT ESCOBAR KNEW THAT BY TAKING HOSTAGE THE SON OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY, HE COULD SUCCESSFULLY EXERT THE PRESSURE HE NEEDED TO ACT IN THE NAME OF THE "EXTRADITABLES." PROBLEMS BEGAN TO SURFACE SOON AFTER THE CARTEL'S SURRENDER, AS MEMBERS AT ODDS WITH ESCOBAR STARTED TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE GROUP. ACCORDING TO MEDELLIN OFFICIALS, THE KIDNAPPINGS OF MONTOYA AND ECHEVARRIA ALSO HAD AN IMPACT ON THE RATE OF ATTRITION AMONG THE "EXTRADITABLES. THE CARTEL'S SURRENDER IS NOT SEEN AS A SURPRISE: THE 4TH ARMY BRIGADE WAS CONDUCTING AN EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH OF THE ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT IN AN EFFORT TO BRING THE KINGPINS TO JUSTICE. MOREOVER, THE ARMY LAUNCHED A PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN AMONG THE LOCALS TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO INFORM AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS. FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF JOSE GON ALO RODRIGUE GACHA, ESCOBAR AND OCHOA WERE CONSTANTLY ON THE MOVE. A SPOKESMAN FOR STATE SECURITY STATES THAT SOPHISTICATED COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT IN MEDELLIN ENABLED THEM TO LEARN ABOUT ESCOBAR'S INTENTIONS ALMOST ON A DAILY BASIS. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH THEIR EXACT WHEREABOUTS, HOWEVER, BECAUSE THEY NEVER REMAINED IN ONE PLACE FOR MORE THAN SIX HOURS AT A TIME. THE TWO DRUG BARONS ALWAYS TRAVELED WITH AN ESCORT OF SIX TO EIGHT MEN WHOM THEY TRUSTED IMPLICITLY. ACCORDING TO A HIGH-RANKING MILITARY OFFICIAL, "WHEN ESCOBAR BEGAN LOSING POWER IN MEDELLIN, HIS CLOSEST AIDES, FEARING PERSECUTION, WENT INTO HIDING." HE ADDS THAT ESCOBAR AND OCHOA TOOK ON THE CAUSE OF TRAFFICKERS WANTED BY THE UNITED STATES, BUT NOTES, "WE ARE WELL AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THE CALI CARTEL MEN DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY." THE EL TIEMPO ARTICLE NOTES THAT ON 19 JANUARY SEVERAL LEADING COLOMBIAN NEWSPAPERS CIRCULATED A NOTICE POINTING TO ESCOBAR AS THE MAN WHO ACTS IN THE NAME OF THE "EXTRADITABLES." LATER, IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT THE AUTHORSHIP OF THE NOTICE WAS ATTRIBUTED TO A DEMENTED PERSON WHOSE NAME HAD CLEARLY BEEN USED. EL TIEMPO ASKS:. "COULD THIS BE A MESSAGE FROM OTHER DRUG TRAFFICKERS WHO ARE UNWILLING TO PAY FOR PABLO ESCOBAR'S ACTIONS? COULD IT BE A MESSAGE FROM THESE SAME TRAFFICKERS WHO DO NOT WANT TO GIVE UP THIS BUSINESS AND THEREFORE ARE UNWILLING TO HAVE ESCOBAR AND OCHOA SPEAK FOR THEM?"
DEV-MUC3-1163	SANTIAGO, 9 MAR 90 -- ADMIRAL JOSE TORIBIO MERINO, FORMER COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE CHILEAN NAVY, TODAY HARSHLY ATTACKED PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA AND NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA. ASKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT ONLY THREE OUT OF 11 PRESIDENTS WHO WILL BE IN CHILE FOR AYLWIN'S INAUGURATION WILL SALUTE CURRENT PRESIDENT GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET ON SATURDAY, MERINO SAID: "WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF THEM. I WILL NOT SHAKE HANDS WITH THAT MAN GARCIA FROM PERU. HE IS FILTHY ." THE ADMIRAL CONTINUED: "NEITHER WILL I SHAKE HANDS WITH A GRIMY PERSON WHO HAS KILLED ANY NUMBER OF PATRIOTS AND WHO IS CREATING TROUBLE FOR THAT LADY...WHAT IS HER NAME?...CHAMORRO." MERINO WAS REFERRING TO ORTEGA, WHO WILL ARRIVE IN SANTIAGO ON SUNDAY. MERINO, WHO RETIRED AFTER 16 YEARS AS NAVY COMMANDER IN CHIEF, MADE THESE REMARKS AFTER A GOVERNMENT JUNTA FAREWELL SESSION. THE GOVERNMENT JUNTA HAS FUNCTIONED AS A LEGISLATIVE BRANCH SINCE 1973. MERINO SAID: "SOME PEOPLE WHO DO NOT WANT TO SHAKE THE PRESIDENT'S HAND COME FROM WRETCHED COUNTRIES WHERE PEOPLE ARE DYING OF HUNGER, COUNTRIES EXPERIENCING DESPERATE INFLATION AND ECONOMIC SITUATIONS. THEY ARE PROPERLY REPRESENTED ." MERINO AND PINOCHET ARE THE ONLY MILITARY OFFICERS WHO HAVE REMAINED IN POWER SINCE THE 11 SEPTEMBER 1973 COUP.
DEV-MUC3-1164	CLANDESTINE, 10 MAR 90 -- AS WE HAVE REPORTED IN THE PAST FEW DAYS, HONDURAN ARMY TROOPS HAVE ENTERED SALVADORAN TERRITORY THROUGH SAN MIGUEL AND MORAZAN DEPARTMENTS TO CARRY OUT KIDNAPPINGS AND ROBBERIES AND COMMIT ABUSES AGAINST SALVADORAN CIVILIANS. HONDURAN AND SALVADORAN TROOPS CLASHED ON 6 MARCH LEAVING ONE DEAD AND ONE WOUNDED AMONG THE RANKS OF THE 10TH REGIMENT OF MARCALA, HONDURAS. THE FMLN URGES THE GOVERNMENT OF RAFAEL CALLEJAS AND THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES' HIGH COMMAND TO ORDER THE END TO THESE INCURSIONS INTO EL SALVADOR THAT ARE AFFECTING HUMBLE CIVILIANS. AT A TIME WHEN THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD ARE CLAMORING FOR PEACE THROUGH DIALOGUE AND UNDERSTANDING AMONG NATIONS, THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT MUST PREVENT FURTHER CONFRONTATIONS AT OTHER BORDER AREAS, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT HONDURAS IS BURDENED BY A SERIOUS ECONOMIC CRISIS AND REQUIRES . THE FMLN REAFFIRMS BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ITS DETERMINATION TO MAINTAIN ITS EFFORTS IN SEARCH OF SOLUTIONS TO REGIONAL CONFLICTS. WITH THAT IN MIND, IT URGES THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT TO ASSUME ITS RESPONSIBILITY IN THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED INCIDENTS.
DEV-MUC3-1165	BOGOTA, 11 MAR 90 -- CESAR GAVIRIA TRUJILLO, A 43-YEAR-OLD ECONOMIST, BECAME THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THE RULING COLOMBIAN LIBERAL PARTY TODAY BY A WIDE MARGIN OF 60 PERCENT IN THE "POPULAR CONSULTATION," AN ELECTION HELD AT THE SAME TIME AS THE LEGISLATIVE AND MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS, THE RADIO STATION NETWORK CARACOL REPORTED TODAY. THE RESULTS WERE REPORTED ONLY A FEW MINUTES AFTER THE ELECTIONS ENDED AT 1600 IN A RELATIVELY CALM CLIMATE. SIMULTANEOUSLY, A PRIVATE POLLING CONCERN THAT CONDUCTED A SURVEY IN NEARLY 90 PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY'S VOTING PRECINCTS ANNOUNCED THAT LIBERAL PARTY CANDIDATE JUAN MARTIN CAICEDO WAS ELECTED THE NEW MAYOR OF BOGOTA AND ANOTHER LIBERAL PARTY MEMBER, OMAR FLOREZ VELEZ, WILL BECOME THE MAYOR OF MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA'S SECOND LARGEST CITY. THE FIRST RESULTS, WHICH ARE NOT OFFICIAL, WERE RELEASED BY THE ELECTRONIC MEDIA AFTER THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN COLOMBIA'S HISTORY GAVE THEM PERMISSION TO ANNOUNCE ELECTION FIGURES BEFORE THE OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENTS OF THE CIVIL REGISTRATION OFFICE, THE STATE AGENCY IN CHARGE OF COUNTING HE VOTES. ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, GAVIRIA LED HIS OPPONENTS BY A WIDE MARGIN. ERNESTO SAMPER PIZANO RECEIVED 18 PERCENT, HERNANDO DURAN DUSSAN, 15 PERCENT; ALBERTO SANTOFIMIO BOTERO, FOUR PERCENT; WILLIAM JARAMILLO GOMEZ, TWO PERCENT; AND JAIME CASTRO CASTRO, ONE PERCENT. GAVIRIA, WHO WAS ALWAYS A FAVORITE IN THE POLLS, REPLACED SENATOR LUIS CARLOS GALAN AS THE LIBERAL PARTY'S PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. GALAN WAS ASSASSINATED BY THE CRIMINAL DRUG TRAFFICKING MAFIAS LAST YEAR.
DEV-MUC3-1166	MOSCOW , 11 MAR 11 -- AFTER STAYING IN POWER FOR 16 YEARS, GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET WAS FINALLY COMPELLED TO LEAVE THE LA MONEDA PRESIDENTIAL PALACE, WHICH HE CAPTURED DURING THE MILITARY COUP OF SEPTEMBER 11, 1973. LAWYER PATRICIO AYLWIN, 71, LEADER OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY, BECAME ITS NEW MASTER TODAY. HE SCORED A SWEEPING VICTORY DURING DECEMBER'S GENERAL ELECTIONS WITH THE SUPPORT OF ALL THE OPPOSITION PARTIES, INCLUDING COMMUNISTS. THE RESTORATION OF DEMOCRACY IN CHILE WILL BY NO MEANS BE EASY. BOMB EXPLOSIONS SHOOK THE CAPITAL ON THE EVE OF THE INAUGURATION CEREMONY AS MILITANTS REMINDED THE PUBLIC OF THEIR PRESENCE. ACCORDING TO AYLWIN, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO OVERCOME THE DEEP POLITICAL DIVISION OF CHILEAN SOCIETY. "ONLY THIS," AYLWIN BELIEVES, "WILL ALLOW CHILE TO DO AWAY WITH VESTIGES OF THE TOTALITARIAN SYSTEM AND EVENTUALLY EXPAND PARLIAMENT'S POWERS, TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION AND THE UNFAIR ELECTORAL SYSTEM AND TO LEGALISE BANNED PARTIES. ANALYSTS BELIEVE THE REVIVAL OF CHILE, WHICH HAS LONG-STANDING DEMOCRATIC TRADITIONS, WILL BE HELD BACK BY THE FACT THAT, ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION IN FORCE, PINOCHET WILL REMAIN COMMANDER-IN- CHIEF OF THE GROUND FORCES FOR EIGHT MORE YEARS. THIS SUBSTANTIALLY CURTAILS THE PRESIDENT'S RIGHTS AS SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE COUNTRY'S ARMED FORCES. FURTHERMORE, BEFORE STEPPING DOWN, THE FORMER RULER HAS ENSURED HIMSELF AN OBEDIENT MAJORITY IN THE SENATE, THE CHILEAN PARLIAMENT'S UPPER CHAMBER. IN THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA THE NEW GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO OVERCOME THE ISOLATION THAT RESULTED FROM THE YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP, WHEN HUMAN RIGHTS WERE GROSSLY VIOLATED AND THOUSANDS OF FREEDOM FIGHTERS WERE RUTHLESSLY PERSECUTED OR ELIMINATED. THIS TASK IS FACILITATED BY THE FACT THAT RELAXATION PROCESSES ARE GAINING MOMENTUM IN THE WORLD AND EAST-WEST COOPERATION IS ON THE UPSWING. NUMEROUS FOREIGN GUESTS, INCLUDING A SOVIET DELEGATION, ARRIVED FOR THE INAUGURATION CEREMONY AND THE TRANSFER OF POWER TO A CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT. AN AGREEMENT IS EXPECTED TO BE SIGNED THESE DAYS ON THE RESTORATION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE SOVIET UNION AND CHILE AND ON THE OPENING OF THEIR RESPECTIVE EMBASSIES IN MOSCOW AND SANTIAGO.
DEV-MUC3-1167	PANAMA CITY , 14 MAR 90 -- A BAND OF COLOMBIAN CRIMINALS AND DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE INVADED THE VERACRUZ COMMUNITY IN THE ARRAIJAN DISTRICT. ACCORDING TO THE PEOPLE WHO GAVE THIS REPORT, THE CRIMINALS ARE WELL-ARMED AND APPARENTLY, WILLING TO FIGHT TO THE END TO MAINTAIN THE CRIMINAL RING, LEFT TO THEM BY FORMER DICTATOR MANUEL ANTONIO NOREIGA. "THEY HAVE WEAPONS SIMILAR TO THE ONES USED BY THE MURDERING DIGNITY BATTALIONS' IN THEIR PRACTICES AND THEY HAVE RECEIVED MANY LATE NIGHT VISITS; SOME NEIGHBORS SAY THEY ALSO SELL DRUGS," SAID A VERACRUZ RESIDENT WHO DID NOT WANT TO BE IDENTIFIED FOR FEAR OF RETALIATION BY THE COLOMBIAN CRIMINALS. THE CHARGES PRESENTED BY VERACRUZ RESIDENTS MAY RESULT IN ANOTHER POLICE OPERATION THAT WILL, ONCE AND FOR ALL, ELIMINATE ALL THE BANDS OF ARMED ASSAILANTS AND DRUG TRAFFICKERS WHO WERE ARMED IN THE PAST BY MANUEL ANTONIO NOREIGA DICTATORSHIP. THE MOST DANGEROUS ASPECT OF THIS SITUATION IS THE RUMORS IN THE CORREGIMIENTO THAT MANY COLOMBIANS, WHO ESCAPED FROM THE RECENT POLICE OPERATION IN CURUNDU, HAVE HIDDEN IN VERACRUZ AND THIS CLEARLY INDICATES THAT THERE IS A FEARLESS ARMY OF CRIMINALS MADE UP OF PANAMANIANS AND UNDOCUMENTED COLOMBIANS.
DEV-MUC3-1168	PANAMA CITY , NO DATE -- THERE WAS NOTHING REMOTELY CLOSE TO A TRIAL HELD, EVEN IF WE HAD THE DEATH PENALTY AS A PUNISHMENT FOR MILITARY CRIMES. THEY WERE ASSASSINS OF THE WORST KIND. THERE WERE OTHER PREVIOUS INCIDENTS, BUT BASICALLY THIS IS THE ACCUSATION. OF MAJOR MOISES GIROLDI'S DEATH? GIROLDI AND MANY OTHERS. MANY PEOPLE WERE KILLED DURING THOSE DAYS. WE DO NOT EXACTLY KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE KILLED. YOU DO NOT KNOW? WE DO NOT KNOW. ARE YOU GOING TO LET THEM LEAVE? ARE YOU GOING TO LET THEM ESCAPE TO PERU? LOOK, AS A LAWYER I KNOW WHAT LATIN AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL TREATIES SAY -- THOSE THAT HAVE ONLY BEEN SIGNED AND RATIFIED BY THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES HAS NOT RATIFIED THEM -- REGARDING THE RIGHT TO ASYLUM. THE HOST COUNTRY DECIDES WHAT CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED, NOT THE HOME COUNTRY. THERE ARE RIGHTS ESTABLISHED IN THOSE TREATIES. THE HOME COUNTRY MAY INQUIRE ABOUT THE CHARGES THAT HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE. THE HOME COUNTRY MAY ASK THE HOST COUNTRY NOT TO DETERMINE WHAT CRIMES HAVE BEEN COMMITTED IN EACH CASE. IF THE HOST COUNTRY HAS ALREADY DECIDED ON THE CHARGES, IT MAY BE ASKED BY THE HOME COUNTRY TO RECONSIDER ITS DECISION AND TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THOSE CHARGES. WE ARE CURRENTLY EXERCISING THOSE RIGHTS. WE HOPE PERU DOES NOT INSIST BECAUSE OUR RELATIONS, AS YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTING OTHER CASES, WHICH ARE LESS SERIOUS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE THE CASE OF A MAN LIKE TOTY SUAREZ ; WE HAVE THE CASE OF GENERAL NORIEGA'S WIFE AND DAUGHTERS; AND A NUMBER OF OTHER CASES WHERE WE CANNOT CALL THESE PEOPLE ASSASINS. WE DID NOT HAVE ANY EVIDENCE AGAINST THEM. WHAT ABOUT MANUEL SOLIS PALMA? SOLIS PALMA LEFT THE EMBASSY AND NOTHING HAPPENED TO HIM. HIS CASE WAS INTERESTING. HE SOUGHT ASYLUM AND THE VENEZUELAN EMBASSY NEVER, NEVER, OFFICIALLY INFORMED THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT THAT SOLIS PALMA WAS THERE. HE WAS THERE AS A GUEST? YES. WHEN WE WERE ASKED ABOUT THE FATE OF SOLIS PALMA, WE REPLIED THAT, FOR ALL WE KNEW, HE WAS SPENDING A FEW DAYS WITH THE VENEZUELAN AMBASSADOR. HE HAD EVERY RIGHT TO SLEEP THERE. I WILL ASK A FEW MORE QUESTIONS. YOU MAY ASK ANYTHING YOU LIKE. THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE SAYING THAT THE INVASION WAS A U.S. PRETEXT NOT TO RETURN THE CANAL IN THE YEAR 2000. NO, NO. THERE HAS NEVER EVEN BEEN THE SLIGHTEST HINT FROM ANY U.S. GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, NOT FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT OR THE ARMY ABOUT THIS. CONGRESSMEN OF ALL IDEOLOGIES HAVE BEEN HERE, EVEN FROM THE EXTREME RIGHT -- I DO NOT THINK THERE ARE ANY EXTREME LEFTIST CONGRESSMEN IN THE UNITED STATES -- AS WELL AS SENATORS. MILITARY OFFICERS HAVE ALSO BEEN HERE. I HAVE HAD LONG TALKS WITH THEM. THEY HAVE NOT EVEN HINTED THAT THEY WANT TO CHANGE THE TREATIES OR THAT THEY WANT TO STAY BEYOND THE YEAR 2000. ALL OF THAT IS NORIEGA'S NONSENSE. NORIEGA WAS THE ONE WHO STARTED THAT CAMPAIGN. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANY TALK ABOUT THIS, NOT EVEN ABOUT THE BASES REMAINING BEYOND THE YEAR 2000. THERE HAS BEEN NONE OF THAT AT ALL.
DEV-MUC3-1169	CLANDESTINE, 16 MAR 90 -- THE GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FMLN DEEMS AS POSITIVE THE GOVERNMENT'S RECOGNITION OF THE FMLN'S GOOD-WILL GESTURES. HOWEVER, WE VIEW AS A NEGATIVE THAT IN THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE THERE IS NOT A CORRESPONDING ATTITUDE. IN THIS REGARD, WE INFORM: 1. THE GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TRIES TO UNDERMINE OUR GESTURE. THE FMLN HAS NEVER HAD A POLICY TO ATTACK OR HARM THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. OUR GESTURES ARE A CLEAR CONTRIBUTION TO STRENGTHENING THE SPACE OF OTHER POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES TO ALLOW FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE POLITICAL NEGOTIATION SOLUTION PROCESS AND IN THE EFFORT TO HUMANIZE THE CONFLICT. 2. THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES CONTINUE TO VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS, BOMB CIVILIAN POPULATED AREAS, SUBJECT THE COUNTRY TO A PERMANENT STATE OF SIEGE, BE IT LEGAL OR DE FACTO. IN A CONSTANT AND SYSTEMATIC MANNER, THE GOVERNMENT MAINTAINS A POLICY OF CAPTURING AND TORTURING LEADERS OF PEOPLE'S GROUPS; MAINTAINS SIEGES AND RAIDS; HARASSES THE COMMUNITIES OF REPATRIATES; AND SABOTAGES THE PROPERTY OF RESIDENTS IN AREAS UNDER THE FMLN CONTROL. IN THE MEANTIME, NO STEP HAS BEEN TAKEN TO INVESTIGATE AND PUNISH THE MURDER OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO AND THE MASSACRE OF FENASTRAS , WHILE THE TRIAL AGAINST THE MURDERERS OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS HAS STAGNATED AND THE SUSPECTS ARE PROMOTED OR SENT ABROAD. THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO APPOINT AS DEFENSE MINISTER THE PERSON WHO GAVE THE ORDER TO MURDER THE PRIESTS, AND IT ALLOWS THE REPORTED EXECUTIONER TO LIVE IN A LUXURY APARTMENT. 3. WE AGREE WITH THE PERMANENT, SERIOUS, IMPORTANT, AND RESERVED CHARACTER THAT THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS SHOULD HAVE. 4. THE GOVERNMENT IS MORALLY AND POLITICALLY COMPELLED TO IMPLEMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE GOODWILL GESTURES THAT WILL PERMIT THE EXERCISE OF CITIZEN'S FREEDOMS AND CEASE THE DAILY HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND ALL FORMS OF AGGRESSION AIMED AT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. 5. WE WARN THAT IT WOULD BE REGRETTABLE FOR THE PEOPLE'S PEACE AND DEMOCRACY HOPES THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES TRY TO HARDEN WARMONGERING POSITIONS, BELIEVING IN THE MIRAGE OF AN ALLEGED WEAKNESS OF THE FMLN. OBVIOUSLY, THIS MISTAKE WOULD ONLY LEAD TO A WORSENING OF THE WAR AND WOULD FURTHER DELAY THE POSSIBILITIES OF NEGOTIATIONS, DEMOCRATIZATION, AND PEACE FOR EL SALVADOR. FMLN GENERAL COMMAND COMMANDER SHAFIK JORGE HANDAL, COMMANDER EDUARDO SANCHO, COMMANDER SALVADOR SANCHEZ CEREN, COMMANDER FRANCISCO JOVEL, COMMANDER JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS EL SALVADOR, 15 MARCH 1990
DEV-MUC3-1170	BOGOTA, 16 MAR 90 -- PICHINCHA BATTALION TROOPS HAVE SEIZED LETTERS, WHICH WERE GOING TO BE USED FOR EXTORTION, AND LARGE AMOUNTS OF WAR MATERIEL IN CLASHES WITH THE 6TH FARC FRONT IN THE BORDER AREA OF THE DEPARTMENTS OF VALLE DEL CAUCA AND CAUCA. IN THE OPERATIONS THAT TOOK PLACE ON 15 MARCH IN THE JAGUAL AREA IN CORINTO MUNICIPALITY, IN NORTHERN CAUCA, 3RD BRIGADE TROOPS KILLED ALONSO CORTES, CONSIDERED THE FARC'S MOST IMPORTANT LEADER IN THE SOUTHWESTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. TWO OTHER GUERRILLAS WERE ALSO KILLED. IN THAT AREA THE PICHINCHA BATTALION TROOPS FOUND A COCAINE PROCESSING LABORATORY AND 35 PACKAGES OF MARIJUANA. WE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE FARC IS INVOLVED IN DRUG TRAFFICKING. AS YOU SAW, THE SEIZURE OF 35 PACKAGES OF MARIJUANA AND OF A COCAINE PROCESSING LABORATORY IN CALOTO, IN THIS SAME OPERATION, SHOWS US THAT WE ARE FACING A SUBVERSIVE GROUP THAT IS ALSO INVOLVED IN THE MARIJUANA BUSINESS ACTIVITY. ON ALONSO CORTES' BODY, THE TROOPS FOUND A LISTING OF PEOPLE WHO WERE SUBJECTED TO NOTING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO GIVE TO THE FARC. THEY ALSO FOUND A LETTER THAT CORTES NEVER SENT FOR A FOR HAVING IMPLICATED THE M-19 . IN THIS MILITARY OPERATION CALLED "LILIANA," THE ARMY SEIZED SHOTGUNS, PISTOLS, ONE SUB-MACHINE GUN, AND LARGE AMOUNTS OF AMMUNITION, IN ADDITION TO DYNAMITE AND CABLES FOR EXPLOSIVES, COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT, DENTAL EQUIPMENT, AND CLOTHING FOR THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF THE MILITARY FORCES.
DEV-MUC3-1171	MANAGUA , 16 MAR 90 -- IN SEPTEMBER 1970, I WAS IN JAIL WITH OTHER COMRADES. OUR JAILERS DID NOT ALLOW US TO READ THE NEWSPAPERS -- NOT EVEN THE ONES PUBLISHED BY THE SOMOZAS -- BUT WE FOUND WAYS TO GET A RADIO AND WERE ABLE TO LEARN OF SALVADOR ALLENDE'S ELECTION THROUGH THE PEOPLE'S VOTE. WE WERE JAIL IN 1973 WHEN WE LEARNED OF THE BRUTAL COUP AGAINST THE PEOPLE'S WILL AND DEMOCRACY. RADIO REPORTS SAID THAT PLANES WERE BOMBING LA MONEDA AND WE PICTURED PRESIDENT ALLENDE HEROICALLY RESISTING THERE. WE DID NOT LOSE OUR MORALE. WE BECAME INDIGNANT AND FULL OF COURAGE. WE THOUGHT AND FELT CERTAIN THAT THE CHILEAN PEOPLE WOULD GO ON WINNING BECAUSE IT WAS THEIR WILL TO BE FREE AND SOVEREIGN. SO MANY YEARS HAD TO PASS FOR US TO BE HERE WITH THE CHILEAN PEOPLE. AFTER THAT CAME THE VICTORY OF THE REVOLUTION IN NICARAGUA. THAT DAY, 19 JULY 1979, WHEN THE VICTORIOUS PEOPLE ENTERED MANAGUA, SALVADOR ALLENDE WAS THERE STRUGGLING SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE. I WANT TO OUTLINE SOME VIEWS, BUT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE CURRENT INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL PICTURE IS EXTREMELY COMPLEX. FIRST OF ALL, WE RESPECT POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL OPTIONS. WHEN WE WON, WE SANDINISTS THOUGHT THAT THE TIME HAD COME TO DEVELOP A DIFFERENT SYSTEM TO GIVE NICARAGUA WHAT HAD BEEN DENIED TO IT BY THE IMPERIALIST DOMINATION. SANDINO EPITOMIZED THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE'S ANTI-IMPERIALIST STRUGGLE, THE FIRST MANIFESTATIONS OF WHICH OCCURRED LAST CENTURY. SANDINO ADVOCATED NOT ONLY A STRUGGLE AGAINST NORTH AMERICAN INTERVENTION, BUT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHANGE. HE DID NOT PUT A LABEL ON HIS THOUGHTS, BUT WAS CONVINCED THAT TO BE A NICARAGUAN AND LATIN AMERICAN, ONE HAD TO BE ANTI-IMPERIALIST AND HAD TO ADVOCATE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATIONS IN FAVOR OF THE PEOPLE. THE SANDINIST FRONT PICKED UP SANDINO'S BANNERS AND ADOPTED HIS STILL UNFINISHED HISTORICAL PROGRAM. SO, AFTER VICTORY, WE THOUGHT THAT WE HAD TO THINK OF A DIFFERENT PROGRAM FOR NICARAGUA. WE REJECTED DOGMAS OR SCHEMES WITH REGARD TO THE METHOD OF STRUGGLE TO ACHIEVE VICTORY OR THE MODEL THAT WOULD BE VIABLE FOR NICARAGUA IN THE LATIN AMERICAN CONTEXT. WE BEGAN WITH THREE BASIC TENETS: A MULTIPARTY SYSTEM, A MIXED ECONOMY, AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE. EXERCISING THIS RIGHT, WE SAID: THIS IS THE PATH. AND THE UNITED STATES SAID: THAT IS NOT THE PATH. TIGHTLY CLINGING TO ITS IMPERIALISTIC POLICY, THE UNITED STATES DECIDED TO DESTROY THE NICARAGUAN REVOLUTION AND ORGANIZED A MILITARY, POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC ONSLAUGHT. YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THIS STORY AND ITS TRAGIC TOLL OF 60,000 VICTIMS. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEFEND NICARAGUA AND THE GAINS ATTAINED BY THE REVOLUTION, BECAUSE THIS DEFENSE WAS HEADED BY THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE WHO, ARMED WITH THEIR CONSCIENCE AND COURAGE, TOOK UP WEAPONS TO DEFEND THEIR HOMELAND'S SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY.
DEV-MUC3-1172	MANAGUA , 16 MAR 90 -- THE GOVERNMENT THAT TAKES OFFICE ON 25 APRIL CAN REST ASSURED, AS CAN MANY LATIN AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS, THAT THERE WILL NEVER AGAIN BE ANOTHER MILITARY COUP IN NICARAGUA. THE HUMBLE PEOPLE, THE PEASANTS, AND THE WORKERS CAN REST ASSURED THAT THE ARMY WILL SAFEGUARD THE FATHERLAND'S SOVEREIGNTY, IT WILL NOT TURN THE CANNONS AGAINST THE WORKERS. I NEVER SAID THAT THE FSLN WOULD PERPETUALLY REMAIN IN THE GOVERNMENT, BUT THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD PERPETUATE THEMSELVES IN POWER. THAT I DID SAY! OTHERS WILL SAY THAT THE SANDINISTS MADE MANY CONCESSIONS, BUT IF WE HELD ELECTIONS, IT WAS BECAUSE WE WERE CONVINCED THAT WE COULD LOSE, A NEW MODEL IN LATIN AMERICA THAT NOT ONLY GUARANTEES THE EXISTENCE OF DEMOCRACY, BUT ITS DEVELOPMENT AND DEEPENING. IT IS DEMOCRATIC TO CONSTANTLY QUESTION DEMOCRACY TO REFRESH, STRENGTHEN, AND DEEPEN DEMOCRACY. THE CLEANEST AND MOST OBSERVED ELECTORAL PROCESS IS THE ONE THAT WAS CARRIED OUT IN NICARAGUA. WE HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE. THE REPORTERS SAID THAT IF WE WON THEY WOULD LEAVE, BUT SINCE WE LOST THEY HAVE STAYED ON TO SEE IF WE WILL SURRENDER POWER ON 25 APRIL. ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT THE FSLN SUFFERED AN UPSET IN THE ELECTIONS, AS A POLITICAL FORCE THAT HAS BEEN THE VANGUARD OF THE PROCESS THAT LED THE COUNTRY TO DEMOCRACY, INDEPENDENCE, DIGNITY, AND SOVEREIGNTY, THE FSLN IS NOW CONSOLIDATING THE RESULTS OF DEMOCRACY. IT IS NOT TRUE THAT THE REVOLUTION HAS BEEN DEFEATED, BECAUSE IT HAS EMERGED FROM THE ELECTIONS STRONGER. I AM PREPARING TO ACT AS THE OPPOSITION ALONGSIDE THE PEOPLE WHEN I AM NO LONGER PRESIDENT ON 25 APRIL. I AM A DEPUTY, BUT I PREFER TO BE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS, THE FACTORIES, AND THE COUNTRYSIDE. I HAVE TOLD THE NICARAGUANS THAT WE MUST CONSOLIDATE THIS PROCESS, WHICH MEANS THE CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY IN NICARAGUA. WE MUST BE MORE CREATIVE AND IMAGINATIVE THAN EVER, BECAUSE WE WILL FACE NEW CHALLENGES THAT WILL BE ENRICHING TO US AS A REVOLUTION. TO BE A CLANDESTINE OPPOSITION IS NOT THE SAME AS TO RULE FROM ABOVE. WE WILL NOW GOVERN FROM BELOW, AND WE WILL DEFEND POPULAR AND NATIONAL INTERESTS. THE RETURN OF SOMOZISM IS NOT SOUGHT. THE ELECTORAL VICTORY DOES NOT MEAN A RETURN OF THE COUNTERREVOLUTION, THAT CONTINUES TO THREATEN NICARAGUA. IF THE COUNTERREVOLUTION IS NOT DISARMED, THE NEW GOVERNMENT WILL ALSO HAVE TO CONFRONT THE COUNTERREVOLUTION, AND WE WILL FIGHT AS WE NEVER DID BEFORE. THE UNITED STATES LIFTED THE EMBARGO AND OFFERED AID TO NICARAGUA. WE WILL NOT BE LIKE RIGHT-WING EXTREMISTS WHO SABOTAGE ECONOMIC EFFORTS. RESOURCES HAVE NOT BEEN OFFERED TO A CERTAIN PARTY, BUT TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE. NICARAGUA NOT ONLY DESERVES INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION, IT SHOULD BE INDEMNIFIED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE FELT THE SOLIDARITY OF PEOPLE THE WORLD OVER, WE HAVE FELT THE SOLIDARITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHO HAVE ALSO BEEN MURDERED BY THE COUNTERREVOLUTION IN OUR FATHERLAND. I HAVE HEARD OF EMOTIONAL EXAMPLES OF SOLIDARITY, SUCH AS BRYAN WILSON'S, WHO SAT IN FRONT OF A TRAIN THAT RAN OVER HIM, AND WHO TELLS ME HE FEELS PROUD TO BE ONE OF THE THOUSANDS OF AMPUTEES FROM THE WAR IN NICARAGUA. THE BLOOD OF CHILEANS, AMERICANS, AND EUROPEANS WAS SHED IN NICARAGUA. I MUST THANK THIS HEROIC AND EXEMPLARY CHILE FOR THE MANNER IN WHICH IT HAS DISPLAYED ITS FONDNESS FOR THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE THROUGH ME, AND I MUST TELL YOU THAT TODAY, MORE THAN EVER, THE SOLIDARITY OF PEOPLE WHO DEFEND THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM, SOVEREIGNTY, DEMOCRACY, AND INDEPENDENCE IS INDISPENSABLE. THE FUTURE, IT IS SAID, BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE, BECAUSE THE PRESENT AND THE PAST ALSO BELONG TO THEM. THE REVOLUTION SHOULD BE REFRESHED, IT SHOULD BE WATERED WITH FRESH RAIN; ONLY THEN WILL THE TREES TURN GREEN AND THE FLOWERS BLOOM, ONLY THEN WILL THE REVOLUTIONARY PROCESSES BE UNDERSTOOD. WE COULD TALK FOR HOURS AND HOURS, BUT THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO TALK. IT IS THE TIME TO ACT. THIS VISIT TO CHILE WILL BE UNFORGETTABLE FOR ME BECAUSE OF THE HAPPINESS, OPTIMISM, AND CONFIDENCE REFLECTED IN THE FACES AND IN THE EYES OF THE CHILEAN PEOPLE. THIS NIGHT WILL BE UNFORGETTABLE FOR ME. THEREFORE, I WISH TO PAY HOMAGE TO THOSE WHO WERE EXAMPLES OF LATIN AMERICAN DIGNITY AND ARE WITH US ALWAYS IN CHILE, NICARAGUA, AND LATIN AMERICA: SALVADOR ALLENDE AND PABLO NERUDA. LONG LIVE NICARAGUA!
DEV-MUC3-1173	SAN SALVADOR, 16 MAR 90 -- THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES CHARGED TODAY THAT A GROUP OF GUERRILLAS ATTACKED A CONTINGENT OF SOLDIERS IN THE TOWN OF VICTORIA, NORTHEASTERN CABANAS DEPARTMENT, FROM A SETTLEMENT FOR DISPLACED PERSONS. THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES. THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE HAS STATED THAT THE REBELS FIRED M-60 MACHINEGUNS AT A PATROL OF SOLDIERS PASSING BY THE SANTA MARTA SETTLEMENT, WHERE SOME 3,000 DISPLACED PERSONS LIVE. THE MILITARY REPORT SAID THAT THE INCIDENT TOOK PLACE ON 15 MARCH AND THE SOLDIERS DID NOT ANSWER THE FIRE. HOWEVER, THE CHRISTIAN COMMITTEE FOR DISPLACED SALVADORANS DENIED THAT THERE ARE ANY ARMED PERSONS IN THIS SETTLEMENT, WHERE THE PERSONS WHO RECENTLY CAME BACK FROM THE HONDURAN CAMP OF MESA GRANDE ARE LIVING. TOMASA RUIZ, SPOKESPERSON FOR CRIPDES, SAID THAT THE CHARGES "ARE A DIRECT THREAT" TO THE SECURITY OF THE DISPLACED PERSONS IN SANTA MARTA. "THIS DOES NOT MEAN," SHE ADDED, "THAT THERE ARE NO CONFRONTATIONS TAKING PLACE OUTSIDE THE CAMP, BUT THERE ARE NO ARMED PERSONS INSIDE THE CAMP." THE ARMED FORCES HAVE SAID THAT THE GUERRILLAS ARE HIDING AMONG THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN ORDER TO ATTACK THE SOLDIERS. ON 11 FEBRUARY, ONE ADULT AND FOUR MINORS WERE KILLED AND 16 OTHERS WERE WOUNDED WHEN A SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTER STRAFED A CAMP OF DISPLACED PERSONS IN CORRAL DE PIEDRAS, CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT. ON THAT OCCASION THE ARMY SAID THAT THE GUERRILLAS ATTACKED THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS FROM THE SETTLEMENT OF REFUGEES WHO RETURNED TO THE COUNTRY LATE LAST YEAR, AFTER HAVING LIVED NEARLY ONE DECADE IN THE HONDURAN CAMPS. IN ADDITION, THE ARMED FORCES SAID THAT THREE SOLDIERS HAD BEEN WOUNDED DURING FIGHTING WITH THE GUERRILLAS IN THE TOWN OF SAN JOSE GUAYABAL, IN THE CENTRAL CUSCATLAN DEPARTMENT. THESE CHARGES WERE MADE PUBLIC ON 16 MARCH WHEN THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT ANNOUNCED A SUSPENSION OF SABOTAGE ACTIONS ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENTS, AND THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS CENTER, AS WELL AS ATTACKS ON CIVILIAN OFFICIALS. THE ARMY ALSO MAINTAINED THAT THE REBELS BLEW UP FIVE ELECTRICITY POSTS IN SAN VICENTE AND MORAZAN DEPARTMENT IN THE CENTER AND NORTHEASTERN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. THE REBELS ALSO HARASSED SOLDIERS WHO WERE GUARDING AN ELECTRICITY STATION IN A TOWN OF SANTA ANA DEPARTMENT AND A MILITARY CHECKPOINT ON THE BRIDGE OVER THE ACELHUATE RIVER IN AGUILARES, NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR. ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY REPORT, THESE HARASSMENT ACTIONS BY THE REBELS DID NOT CAUSE ANY CASUALTIES.
DEV-MUC3-1174	SANTIAGO, 13 MAR 90 -- U.S. VICE PRESIDENT DAN QUAYLE TALKED WITH PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA DURING AN OFFICIAL LUNCH AND TOLD HIM THAT HE FULLY AGREES WITH THE NEED TO DEMOBILIZE AND DISARM THE CONTRAS BEFORE 25 APRIL TO GUARANTEE A NORMAL TRANSITION OF POWER TO THE NEW GOVERNMENT. DANIEL SAID IN A STATEMENT TO BARRICADA: "VICE PRESIDENT QUAYLE TOLD ME THEY ARE WORKING ON AN IDEA SO THAT THE CONTRAS ARE NOT AROUND BY 25 APRIL. HE STATED HIS POLITICAL WILLINGNESS TO DO THIS, AND I BELIEVE HIS POSITION WAS VERY CONSTRUCTIVE." WHEN ASKED WHAT STEPS WILL BE TAKEN TO CARRY THIS OUT, HE REPLIED: "WE -- AND NOT ONLY THE NICARAGUANS AND CENTRAL AMERICANS, BUT ALSO THE UNITED STATES -- MUST NOW PUT WORDS INTO DEEDS TO PUT THE POLITICAL WILL INTO ACTIONS THAT WILL ENABLE US TO DISARM AND DEMOBILIZE THE CONTRAS BEFORE THAT DATE." REFERRING TO CERTAIN ATTEMPTS BY UNO SECTORS TO ESTABLISH A SYMMETRY BETWEEN THE CONSTITUTIONAL ARMED FORCES OF NICARAGUA AND THE CONTRAS' TERRORIST FORCES, DANIEL POINTED OUT: "NO, NO, NO, NOBODY HAS PROPOSED THIS. NONE OF THE PRESIDENTS WITH WHOM I HAVE TALKED THINKS ALONG THESE LINES." ORTEGA INSISTED THAT THE CONVERSATION WITH THE U.S. VICE PRESIDENT HAD BEEN "FRANK, FRIENDLY, DIRECT, AND VERY RESPECTFUL," AND THAT QUAYLE "IS CERTAIN THAT THE TRANSFER OF POWER WILL BE CARRIED OUT ON 25 APRIL. HE ALSO STATED HIS WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE SO THAT NICARAGUA DOES NOT HAVE TO LIVE IN A FAR MORE CRITICAL SITUATION THAN THE ONE IT IS CURRENTLY FACING IN EVERY SECTOR." DANIEL CONSIDERED THE MEETING, WHICH OCCURRED DURING LUNCH, AS "VERY POSITIVE, AND I FIND HIM CONSTRUCTIVELY INCLINED TOWARD ALL THE EFFORTS THAT WE, THE NICARAGUANS, HAVE EXERTED, AND WHICH CULMINATED WITH THE 25 FEBRUARY ELECTIONS." THE PRESIDENT ALSO REFERRED TO CONVERSATIONS HELD DURING THE FLIGHT BETWEEN CARACAS AND SANTIAGO DE CHILE WITH THE PRESIDENTS OF SPAIN, VENEZUELA, COSTA RICA, AND HONDURAS, CONFIRMING: "WE ALL AGREE THAT THE CONTRAS SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY DISARMED AND DEMOBILIZED." ORTEGA TALKED BRIEFLY WITH QUAYLE YESTERDAY MORNING DURING THE TE DEUM OFFERED AT THE METROPOLITAN CATHEDRAL FOR THE PRESIDENTS WHO WERE INVITED TO THE INAUGURATION OF CHILEAN PRESIDENT PATRICIO AYLWIN. WHEN DANIEL ENTERED THE CATHEDRAL, THOSE ATTENDING THE TE DEUM APPLAUDED HIM WHILE HE GREETED THE HEADS OF STATE WHO WERE THERE. WHEN QUAYLE ENTERED, HE APPROACHED DANIEL AND GREETED HIM IN A FRIENDLY MANNER, WHILE THE THRILLED CROWD CONTINUED TO APPLAUD. PERSONS WHO OVERHEARD THE BRIEF CONVERSATION REPORTED TO BARRICADA THAT QUAYLE TOLD DANIEL THAT IF HE WISHED TO SEND A MESSAGE TO BUSH HE WOULD DELIVER IT, THEREBY AGREEING TO WAIT UNTIL AN APPROPRIATE TIME TO HOLD THEIR CONVERSATION. THIS MOMENT OCCURRED SEVERAL HOURS LATER DURING THE OFFICIAL LUNCH. DURING THE MORNING DANIEL ALSO MET WITH MEMBERS OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES OPPOSED TO THE OUTGOING PINOCHET GOVERNMENT. HE EXPLAINED TO THEM THE RESULTS OF THE NICARAGUAN ELECTIONS, WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS "A TACTICAL DEFEAT BUT A STRATEGIC VICTORY FOR THE FSLN." SHORTLY AFTERWARD THE PRESIDENT MET WITH CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADERS, INCLUDING PARTY PRESIDENT ANDRES ZALDIVAR. AT THIS MEETING THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS SAID THAT THE NICARAGUAN ELECTORAL PROCESS WAS CLEAN AND OPEN, AND THEY PRAISED THE FSLN'S FULFILLMENT OF ITS DEMOCRATIC OBLIGATIONS. THEY ALSO PRAISED PRESIDENT ORTEGA'S ATTITUDE AND THE WIDESPREAD INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION HE HAS OBTAINED. IN THE AFTERNOON, PRESIDENT ORTEGA SPOKE BRIEFLY TO NEWSMEN AFTER VISITING "LA MONEDA" PRESIDENTIAL PALACE TO OFFER HIS OFFICIAL GREETINGS TO CHILEAN PRESIDENT PATRICIO AYLWIN. "I HAVE TRANSMITTED THE GREETINGS OF THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE TO THE CHILEAN PEOPLE AND HAVE MADE REFERENCE TO THE LONG-STANDING FRIENDSHIP THAT UNITES THE TWO NATIONS," DANIEL TOLD NEWSMEN ON THE PATIO OF THE "LA MONEDA" PALACE, THE SAME PLACE WHERE PRESIDENT SALVADOR ALLENDE FELL FIGHTING FOR HIS PEOPLE ON 11 SEPTEMBER 1973. "IT IS AN HONOR FOR ME TO BE HERE, SHARING THIS HISTORICAL MOMENT WITH THE CHILEAN PEOPLE. I AM CONVINCED THAT WE WILL CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE PEOPLES OF THE CONTINENT TO BUILD AN INDEPENDENT, FREE, LATIN AMERICAN FATHERLAND WITH SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE AND WITH TRUE PEACE, SOVEREIGNTY, AND DEMOCRACY," ORTEGA TOLD THE JOURNALISTS, WHO RESPONDED WITH APPLAUSE.
DEV-MUC3-1175	SANTIAGO, 21 MAR 90 -- TWO INDIVIDUALS SHOT FORMER GOVERNMENT JUNTA MEMBER GUSTAVO LEIGH GUZMAN AT POINT BLANK RANGE THIS MORNING. GENERAL LEIGH WAS ATTACKED AT HIS OFFICE AT BARRIO ALTO. HIS CONDITION IS VERY SERIOUS. HE WAS HIT FIVE TIMES DURING THE ATTACK AT AROUND 1100 THIS MORNING. GEN. GUSTAVO LEIGH IS BEING TREATED AT THE MILITARY HOSPITAL. INTERIOR MINISTER ENRIQUE KRAUSS, LEGISLATORS, CHURCH OFFICIALS AND OTHER AUTHORITIES VISITED THE HOSPITAL TO CHECK ON LEIGH'S CONDITION. PRESIDENT PATRICIO AYLWIN SUSPENDED ALL AUDIENCES AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE SAVAGE ATTACK. MINISTER SECRETARY OF GOVERNMENT ENRIQUE CORREA SAID THE ATTACK WAS TREMENDOUSLY REGRETTABLE AND CONDEMNABLE. INTERIOR UNDER SECRETARY VELISARIO VELAZCO SAID THE GROUP RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACK WILL BE SENTENCED WITH MAXIMUM SEVERITY. CATHOLIC CHURCH AUTHORITIES, LEGISLATORS FROM ALL PARTY BLOCS, BUSINESSMEN, ENTREPRENEURS, WORKERS, AND THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL CONDEMNED THE ATTACK TERMING IT A SHOCK AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. DOCTOR FRANCISCO ALAMAN SAID FORMER AIR FORCE COMMANDER LEIGH IS FOR THE TIME BEING OUT OF IMMEDIATE DANGER OF DEATH. THE OTHER GENERAL WOUNDED IN THE ATTACK, RETIRED GENERAL ENRIQUE RUIZ, WAS HIT BY THREE BULLETS AND IS BEING TREATED AT THE AIR FORCE HOSPITAL. SO FAR THE MILITARY HOSPITAL HAS NOT RELEASED ANY OFFICIAL REPORT ON LEIGH'S CONDITION. THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT, AUTONOMOUS FACTION, HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK.
DEV-MUC3-1176	GUATEMALA CITY, 22 MAR 90 -- DANIEL SOLORZANO, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE RULING GUATEMALAN CHRISTIAN DEMOCRACY WAS SHOT AND KILLED ON 21 MARCH BY UNIDENTIFIED MEN, THE POLICE REPORTED TODAY. SOLORZANO, WHO WAS 45 AND THE MUNICIPAL MAYOR OF SAN PABLO , WAS FOUND SHOT IN THE CABUZ RIVER IN MALACATAN MUNICIPALITY, THE SOURCES SAID. NO ONE KNOWS THE MOTIVE FOR THE POLITICAL LEADER'S MURDER IN SAN MARCOS, A DEPARTMENT WHERE THE GUERRILLAS HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN RECENT DAYS. EARLY ON THE MORNING OF 21 MARCH, REBEL GROUPS DETONATED EIGHT BOMBS IN FRONT OF THE HOMES OF GOVERNMENT AND MUNICIPAL OFFICIALS IN THIS DEPARTMENT. TWO PEOPLE WERE INJURED.
DEV-MUC3-1177	BOGOTA, NO DATE -- JARAMILLO OSSA HAS SAID THAT FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS HE HAD ASKED THE GOVERNMENT FOR PROTECTION, THAT HIS LIFE WAS IN DANGER, AND THAT HE HELD THE GOVERNMENT DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HIM. THAT IS WHAT JARAMILLO OSSA SAID. DID YOU SAY FOR THE PAST 4 YEARS? THAT IS WHAT JARAMILLO OSSA SAID, THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS SAFETY DURING THE PAST 4 YEARS. HE ALSO SAID THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED FROM THEN ON WOULD ALSO BE BLAMED ON YOUR STATEMENT, AND THAT THE BEST SERVICE YOU COULD GIVE THE COUNTRY WOULD BE TO RESIGN. I ALREADY REPLIED TO A QUESTION ABOUT MY RESIGNATION. I CANNOT RESIGN BECAUSE I AM NOT GUILTY. BY RESIGNING I WOULD BE ADMITTING MY GUILT TO SOMETHING I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH. HOWEVER, I AM GLAD THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT THIS HAS BEEN OCCURRING FOR THE PAST 4 YEARS. I WAS A JOURNALIST FOUR YEARS AGO. MADE A MISTAKE A FEW DAYS AGO BY AGAIN LINKING THE UP WITH THE FARC? I PREFER NOT TO DISCUSS THIS TOPIC NOW. I DO NOT THINK THAT THIS IS THE BEST TIME TO DISCUSS THAT SUBJECT. AFTER THIS SITUATION HAS SETTLED, I WILL HAVE TO FILE A FORMAL STATEMENT AT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WHERE I HAVE BEEN SUMMONED BY THE UP. AS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, I AM OBLIGED TO APPEAR BEFORE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO EXPLAIN MY ACTIONS, BUT NOW IS NOT THE MOMENT TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING. OF COURSE, THE PRESIDENT IS VERY DISTRESSED, AS WE ALL ARE. WE BELIEVE THIS IS A TERRIBLE; THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN. IT IS EVIDENT THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEKING A GOAL OPPOSITE TO THAT OF THE GOVERNMENT ARE INVOLVED IN THIS. THE GOVERNMENT WANTS A FREE ELECTORAL PROCESS; IT IS COMMITTED TO THAT. TODAY, WHEN WE HAVE A COMPLETELY ORDERLY ELECTORAL PROCESS, IT WOULD BE ABSURD, ILLOGICAL, IRRATIONAL, AND SENSELESS FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PROMOTE ACTIONS THAT RUN COUNTER TO ITS GOAL OF ENSURING THAT ITS TERM ENDS IN PEACE AND THAT THE ELECTIONS WILL TAKE PLACE NORMALLY. THE UP HAS AGAIN CAST DOUBT OVER THE GOVERNMENT'S GUARANTEES FOR THE CANDIDATES AND THE PARTY. I BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS DONE EVERYTHING HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF CANDIDATES, NOT ONLY THE SAFETY OF UP MEMBERS, BUT OF ALL PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, REGARDLESS OF THEIR AFFILIATION. IN THEIR COMMUNIQUE, EVIDENCE OF THE FACT THAT DR JARAMILLO'S BODYGUARDS REACTED AND, I UNDERSTAND, BY KILLING ONE OF THE ASSASSINS, AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT I HAVE HEARD, AND ARRESTED ANOTHER ONE, WHICH HAS BEEN CONFIRMED, SHOWS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS INDEED OFFERING PROTECTION. THEREFORE, DR. JARAMILLO WAS INDEED ENJOYING GOVERNMENT PROTECTION JUST AS THE OTHER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ARE. WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THE ASSASSINS CARRY OUT SURPRISE ATTACKS. AT A GIVEN MOMENT, AN APPROACHING PERSON CAN CAN PULL OUT A WEAPON AND KILL WHOMEVER HE WANTS. THERE IS NO 100-PERCENT PREVENTION AGAINST THIS. THIS HOLDS TRUE NOT ONLY IN COLOMBIA BUT IN MANY COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. THE VERY COURSE OF THESE TERRIBLE EVENTS OF THIS MORNING AT THE AIPORT SHOW THAT DR JARAMILLO WAS INDEED PROTECTED. THE UP HAS JUST ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL FILE SUIT AGAINST YOU FOR THIS ASSASSINATION. THAT IS FINE. IF THE UP HAS ANY EVIDENCE THAT I AM INVOLVED IN DR. JARAMILLO'S ASSASSINATION, THEN IT MUST FILE SUIT, BECAUSE OTHERWISE, IT WOULD BE ACTING AS AN ACCOMPLICE TO THIS ASSASSINATION. I BELIEVE THAT SUITS MUST BE FILED BY THOSE WHO SUSPECT THAT A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, AND MYSELF PARTICULARLY, MAY BE INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION, TO ENSURE THAT THE INCIDENT IS INVESTIGATED. THEREFORE, I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GOOD NEWS AMID A SEA OF BAD NEWS THAT WE HAVE HEARD TODAY. ONLY RESPONSIBILITY FOR PHYSICAL SAFETY, BUT THERE IS ALSO POLITICAL RESPONSIBILITY. YOU ARE BEING ACCUSED OF POLITICAL IRRESPONSIBILITY AND OF NOT RESPONSIBILE FOR PHYSICAL SAFETY.
DEV-MUC3-1178	BOGOTA, 22 MAR 90 -- BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA, THE 36-YEAR-OLD PATRIOTIC UNION PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, HAS DIED FROM GUNSHOT WOUNDS, ANGELINO GARZON, SPOKESMAN FOR THAT POLITICAL ORGANIZATION, HAS REPORTED.
DEV-MUC3-1179	BOGOTA, 22 MAR 90 -- THE COLOMBIAN TEACHERS FEDERATION, FECODE, HAS JUST ANNOUNCED IT WILL HOLD A NATIONWIDE 48-HOUR STRIKE TO PROTEST THE ASSASSINATION OF BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION . THE UP COORDINATING BOARD IN URABA HAS ALSO ORDERED THAT A STRIKE BY HELD IN THAT REGION. THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL WILL BE MEETING AT THE NARINO PALACE IN BOGOTA IN APPROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES. IT WILL BE CHAIRED BY PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO. PROTESTS AND DISORDER HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN SOME AREAS OF BOGOTA. A BUS WAS SET ON FIRE NEAR THE UP HEADQUARTERS. THERE HAVE ALSO PROTESTS AT THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY AND NEAR THE CENTRAL POLICE HOSPITAL WHERE JARAMILLO OSSA WAS TAKEN AND DIED.
DEV-MUC3-1180	BOGOTA, 22 MAR 90 -- RADIO CADENA NACIONAL HAS LEARNED THAT DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL OSCAR BOTERO RESTREPO HAS ORDERED THE INDEFINITE CONFINEMENT OF NATIONAL POLICE AND MILITARY FORCES TO THEIR BARRACKS. THEY ARE TO STAY THERE UNTIL IT IS CLEAR THAT THE PUBLIC ORDER SITUATION RESULTING FROM THE ASSASSINATION OF BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA, PATRIOTIC UNION PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, IS UNDER CONTROL. MEANWHILE, A NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING IS TAKING PLACE AT THE NARINO PRESIDENTIAL PALACE. THE PARTICIPANTS ARE DISCUSSING THE INCIDENTS THAT DISRUPTED THE DAILY LIVES OF ALL COLOMBIANS TODAY WHEN A TERRORIST KILLED UP PRESIDENT BERNARDO JARAMILLO AT THE EL DORADO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO AND GOVERNMENT MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS SIMMONDS HAVE BEEN IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE POLICE AUTHORITIES AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY, DAS, IN AN EFFORT TO LEARN ALL THE DETAILS FOLLOWING THE ATTACK ON JARAMILLO. THE OFFICES OF THE DAS. TO AVOID CONFUSING REPORTS AND MISINTERPRETATIONS, ALL REPORTS HAVE BEEN RELEASED THROUGH THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT MINISTRY, WHICH IS HEADED BY DR. CARLOS LEMOS SIMMONDS.
DEV-MUC3-1181	SAN SALVADOR, 22 MAR 90 -- OTTO SORTO MILLA, THE SON-IN-LAW OF GENERAL RAFAEL VILLAMARIONA, CHIEF OF THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE, WAS WOUNDED IN AN ATTACK IN SAN SALVADOR TODAY AND IS IN "SERIOUS CONDITION," ACCORDING TO MILITARY SPOKESMEN AND DOCTORS. THE SOURCES POINTED OUT THAT SORTO MILLA, 25, WAS MACHINEGUNNED FROM A MOVING VEHICLE WHILE LEAVING HIS HOME, LOCATED IN THE LUXURIOUS SAN FRANCISCO NEIGHBORHOOD IN SOUTHWEST SAN SALVADOR. DOCTORS TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT GEN. VILLAMARIONA'S SON-IN-LAW IS "IN SERIOUS CONDITION" AT A PRIVATE HOSPITAL, WHERE HE WAS ADMITTED AT 1030 , BUT THEY DID NOT SPECIFY WHERE THE BULLET WOUNDS WERE OR THE NUMBER OF BULLETS THAT HIT HIM. MILITARY SPOKESMEN SAID THAT SORTO MILLA HAD BULLET WOUNDS IN SEVERAL PARTS OF THE BODY, BUT THEY REFUSED TO PROVIDE MORE DETAILS AS LONG AS THE POLICE ARE CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS TO CAPTURE THE ASSAILANTS. GEN. VILLAMARIONA, CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE HARD-LINE MILITARY CHIEFS OF THE ARMED FORCES, WAS APPOINTED TO HIS PRESENT POST IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR REPLACING GENERAL RAFAEL BUSTILLO, WHO WAS APPOINTED MILITARY ATTACHE IN ISRAEL. THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE PLAYED A KEY ROLE DURING THE LAST GUERRILLA MILITARY OFFENSIVE IN NOVEMBER 1989, AND IT WAS ACCUSED BY OPPOSITION GROUPS, HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS, AND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH OF INDISCRIMINATELY BOMBING POOR NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE CAPITAL TO DISLODGE REPORTED GUERRILLA REDOUBTS. THE ATTACK ON SORTO MILLA TOOK PLACE A WEEK AFTER THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT SUSPENDED ITS ATTACKS ON CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CREATION OF CONDITIONS FOR THE RESUMPTION OF THE DIALOGUE WITH PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT. OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE NOT DISCLOSED WHO THEY BELIEVE CARRIED OUT THE ATTACK OR PROVIDED ANY BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON SORTO MILLA.
DEV-MUC3-1182	BOGOTA, NO DATE -- AMID ALL THE CONFUSION AND ALARM THAT TODAY PREVAILS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, WHAT WOULD DR. LLOREDA DO TO RESTORE PUBLIC TRANQUILITY? WHAT IS THE IMMEDIATE AND MOST URGENT THING TO DO? JUAN, I BELIEVE THAT SECURITY IS NO LONGER AN ACADEMIC ISSUE; IT HAS BECOME AN ANGUISHED NEED FOR COLOMBIA. THIS WILL PROBABLY MEAN THAT WE WILL HAVE TO MAKE MANY SACRIFICES IF WE WANT TO PUT A STOP TO VIOLENCE WITHIN A FEW YEARS. IN FACT, WE WILL HAVE TO SACRIFICE SOME OF THE BROAD AND GENEROUS FREEDOM WE HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED IN THIS COUNTRY. GIVEN THESE DEPLORABLE ACTIONS, THE SECURITY ISSUE HAS BECOME A PRIORITY, BECAUSE ONE CANNOT LIVE IN A SOCIETY IN WHICH ITS MEMBERS ARE CONTINUOUSLY THREATENED. THIS NOT ONLY REFERS TO DR. JARAMILLO OSSA'S DEATH, BUT ALSO TO OTHER DEATHS THAT SOMETIMES DO NOT APPEAR WHERE THEY SHOULD, MEANING THE FRONT PAGE OF THE NEWSPAPERS. A WEEK OR TWO AGO THE POLICE SAID THAT WE HAVE HAD AN AVERAGE OF 54 VIOLENT DEATHS PER DAY SO FAR THIS YEAR. IF THIS CONTINUES, WE WILL HAVE MORE THAN 12,000 MURDERS IN COLOMBIA BY THE TIME PRESIDENT BARCO TURNS OVER POWER ON 7 AUGUST. I BELIEVE, AND I THINK YOU SHARE THE SAME VIEWPOINT, THAT WE HAVE A WORLD RECORD FOR INSECURITY AND VIOLENCE. THEREFORE, WE CANNOT TAKE THE RISK OF ALLOWING THE PROCESS OF MORAL COLLAPSE AND THE STATE OF INSECURITY THAT PREVAILS IN THE COUNTRY TO CONTINUE. WE MUST STRENGTHEN THE STATE SO THAT IT CAN SUCCESSFULLY COUNTER VIOLENCE. THE PLEBISCITE AND THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY I HAVE BEEN PROPOSING INCLUDES THE NEED FOR THE STATE TO HAVE EFFICIENT INSTRUMENTS TO COUNTER VIOLENT ACTIONS. THIS IS NOT, LIKE I SAID IN THE BEGINNING, AN ACADEMIC ISSUE; AND IT IS NOT A PROPOSAL PRESENTED BY IDEALISTIC YOUTHS. IT IS THE EXPRESSION OF A NATION THAT COULD DISAPPEAR OR LOSE ITS FREEDOMS AND DEMOCRACY, IF WE DO NOT ACT DECISIVELY AND RESOLUTELY. THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM BETWEEN POLITICAL PARTIES. YESTERDAY I PRESENTED MY GOVERNMENT PLATFORM AND I ISSUED A PROPOSAL TO DR. GAVIRIA -- REGARDLESS OF THE 27 MAY ELECTORAL RESULTS, WE MUST REACH A PATRIOTIC AGREEMENT. WE CAN NOW DO IT IN HOMAGE TO BERNARDO JARAMILLO SO THAT THE IDEA OF A PLEBISCITE IS SPONSORED. THUS, WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE A THOROUGH INSTITUTIONAL REORGANIZATION. WE MUST SIT DOWN AND THINK ABOUT COLOMBIA, RATHER THAN ELECTORAL LEADERS AND ORGANIZATIONS. THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN OFFER SOLUTIONS TO FUTURE GENERATIONS, BECAUSE THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE ARE NOW LOOKING TO THEIR FUTURE WITH UNCERTAINTY AND FEAR. THANK YOU, DR. LLOREDA, YOU ARE VERY KIND. THANK YOU.
DEV-MUC3-1183	PANAMA CITY , 22 MAR 90 -- PANAMANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER JULIO LINARES ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD GRANTED SAFE-CONDUCTS TO FIVE FORMER OFFICIALS OF THE DEPOSED REGIME, HEADED BY GENERAL MANUAL ANTONIO NORIEGA. THE FIVE FORMER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE PRESENTLY AT THE ECUADORAN EMBASSY. ACCORDING TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT, FORMER PUBLIC WORKS MINISTER RENE BULTRON, FORMER LABOR MINISTER CESAR MARTANS, FORMER MORTGAGE BANK MANAGER JULIO SHAIK, FORMER TOURISM INSTITUTE DIRECTOR BERNARDO DOMINGUEZ, AND FORMER HYRAULIC RESOURCES AND ELECTRIFICATION INSTITUTE DIRECTOR OVIGILDO HERRERA, ARE THE FORMER OFFICIALS WHO WILL BE ABLE TO TRAVEL TO ECUADOR WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. LINARES ADDED THAT THE DECISION TO GRANT A SAFE-CONDUCT TO FORMER DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONARY PARTY LEGISLATOR LUIS "LUCHO" GOMEZ -- PRESENTLY AT THE CUBAN EMBASSY -- HAS BEEN REVOKED BECAUSE HE FACES CHARGES OF "KIDNAPPING AND PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE AGAINST THE PANAMANIAN CITIZEN HERNAN ARIAS." THE PANAMANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER ALSO REJECTED THE POSSIBILITY OF BREAKING RELATIONS WITH MEXICO OR PERU. ACCORDING TO HIS EXPLANATION, THE SITUATION WITH CUBA IS DIFFERENT. TODAY, PANAMA GAVE CUBAN AMBASSADOR LAZARO MORA FIVE DAYS TO QUIT THE COUNTRY "BECAUSE OF THE UNJUSTIFIED ATTACKS BY THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT." FORMER PANAMA NATIONAL BANK MANAGER RAFAEL AROSEMENA HAS TAKEN REFUGE AT THE MEXICAN EMBASSY. AROSEMENA IS CHARGED WITH ALLOWING A FORMER COMMAND STAFF MEMBER OF THE ELIMINATED PANAMA DEFENSE FORCES TO CASH CHECKS MADE OUT TO THE BEARER FOR $12 MILLION. THE FORMER FDP MAYORS HERACLIDIS SUCRE MEDINA AND GONZALO GONZALEZ CONTINUE TO STAY AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA. THEY ARE CHARGED WITH SEVERAL CRIMES.
DEV-MUC3-1184	BOGOTA, 22 MAR 90 -- TENSION PREVAILED THIS EVENING IN THE CAPITAL AFTER THE BODY OF PATRIOTIC UNION CANDIDATE BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE OVAL ROOM IN THE NATIONAL CONGRESS, WHERE HE WILL LIE IN STATE UNTIL HIS FUNERAL ON 24 MARCH. BOGOTA MAYOR ANDRES PASTRANA ARANGO DECREED A DRY LAW AT NOON, AND SUSPENDED CLASSES IN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC ELEMENTARY AND HIGH SCHOOLS TOMORROW, 23 MARCH. THE PRESIDENT ATTENDED A SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING AT NATINO PALACE AND THE MILITARY COMMANDERS TALKED WITH JOURNALISTS WHEN LEAVING THE PREMISES. DEFENSE MINISTER OSCAR BOTERO SAID THAT THE MEDELLIN CARTEL PLANNED AND CARRIED OUT THE ASSASSINATION UPON INSTRUCTIONS FROM PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, WHO MADE A DOWN PAYMENT OF 300,000 PESOS TO ANDRES ARTURO GUTIERREZ, THE ASSASSIN HIRED TO PERPETRATE THE CRIME. THE ASSASSIN, A 16-YEAR-OLD YOUTH, IS RECOVERING FROM HIS WOUNDS AND, IN A PRELIMINARY DECLARATION TO THE AUTHORITIES, HE CONFIRMED WHO ORDERED THE ASSASSINATION. MOREOVER, DAS DETECTIVE EDISON SANCHEZ MENDIETA, WHO WAS WOUNDED THIS MORNING AT THE AIRPORT TERMINAL, WAS RELEASED THIS AFTERNOON. REFERRING TO THE WAY IN WHICH THE WEAPON WAS SMUGGLED INTO THE AIRPORT, THE AUTHORITIES SAID THAT THIS ISSUE IS BEING THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED BY SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS -- BECAUSE IT COULD HAVE BEEN ASSEMBLED INSIDE THE PREMISES OR SMUGGLED IN WITH THE COMPLICITY OF A MAINTENANCE WORKER. RIOTS, CLASHES, AND THE BURNING OF TIRES AND FIVE BUSES WAS REPORTED IN SEVERAL HIGHER EDUCATION CENTERS OF BOGOTA, SUCH AS THE FREE UNIVERSITY, THE PEDAGOGICAL UNIVERSITY, THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY; AND IN NEIGHBORHOODS SUCH AS POLICARPA SALAVARRIETA, GARCES NAVAS, AND SOACHA. THESE ACTIONS RESULTED IN THE WOUNDING OF A POLICEMAN, WHOSE CONDITION IS STILL CRITICAL. TEACHERS WHO ARE MEMBERS OF FECODE HAVE ORDERED A TWO-DAY STRIKE STARTING TOMORROW. BANANA FARM WORKERS IN URABA, WHERE THE ASSASSINATED LEADER WORKED AS A LABOR LAWYER, REACTED SIMILARLY. TRANSPORTATION ACTIVITIES HAVE NOTICEABLY DECREASED IN THE CAPITAL SINCE THE MAYOR URGED THE CITIZENRY TO GO HOME EARLY IN THE EVENING. THE ASSASSINATED CANDIDATE'S BODY IS CURRENTLY LYING IN STATE IN THE OVAL ROOM OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS.
DEV-MUC3-1185	BOGOTA, 23 MAR 90 -- ACCORDING TO A BOGOTA METROPOLITAN POLICE PROVISIONAL REPORT, PUBLIC ORDER DISTURBANCES, RESULTING FROM THE MURDER OF PATRIOTIC UNION CANDIDATE BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA, HAVE RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF ONE 10TH INFANTRY BRIGADE SOLDIER, THE INJURING OF TWO POLICEMEN, THE ARREST OF OVER 120 PEOPLE, AND THE DESTRUCTION OF FIVE PUBLIC BUSES. OFFICIAL SPOKESMEN OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT DURING DISTURBANCES IN THE POLICARPA NEIGHBORHOOD, 10TH INFANTRY BRIGADE SOLDIER ARTURO BERNAL WAS SHOT TO DEATH. MEANWHILE, POLICEMEN GABRIEL HORACIO GARAY AND HENRY MORENO RAMIREZ WERE INJURED IN OTHER SECTORS OF BOGOTA. THE POLICEMEN, WHO SUFFERED VARIOUS INJURIES, WERE TAKEN TO A POLICE HOSPITAL. ALSO, DURING CLASHES AT POLICARPA, BOZA, AND IZU NEIGHBORHOODS AND DOWNTOWN BOGOTA, FIVE PUBLIC BUSES WERE BURNED CAUSING LOSSES IN THE MILLIONS. THE POLICE SPOKESMEN ALSO TOLD THIS RADIO STATION THAT AT LEAST 120 PEOPLE WERE DETAINED DURING THE NIGHT AND EARLY THIS MORNING DURING THE VARIOUS DISTURBANCES. HOWEVER, THE SPOKESMEN STATED, THE PUBLIC ORDER SITUATION IS UNDER CONTROL IN THE SPECIAL DISTRICT AREA, WHERE STRICT SECURITY MEASURES, A DRY LAW, SCHOOL CLOSURES, THE CONFINEMENT OF TROOPS TO THEIR BARRACKS, AND OTHER MEASURES HAVE BEEN ADOPTED.
DEV-MUC3-1186	MEDELLIN, 23 MAR 90 -- DIEGO MONTANA CUELLAR, PRESIDENT OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION , HAS RECEIVED A LETTER SIGNED BY PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, IN WHICH HE EMPHATICALLY DENIES ANY PARTICIPATION IN THE ASSASSINATION OF BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA. THE LETTER, WHICH CARRIES ESCOBAR GAVIRIA'S SIGNATURE AND FINGERPRINT, WAS ALSO SENT TO THE MEDELLIN MEDIA. IN HIS LETTER TO THE UP, ESCOBAR GAVIRIA STATED: I ALWAYS LIKED, ADMIRED, AND RESPECTED BERNARDO JARAMILLO. ESCOBAR GAVIRIA DISCLOSED THAT HE MET SEVERAL TIMES TO INTERCEDE WITH GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA TO ENSURE THAT JARAMILLO OSSA'S LIFE WOULD BE RESPECTED. ESCOBAR GAVIRIA ADDED: THIS CAN BE CONFIRMED BY MANY MEMBERS OF JARAMILLO OSSA'S POLITICAL MOVEMENT AND EVEN BY SOME OF HIS DAS BODYGUARDS WHO WERE WITNESSES AT THOSE MEETINGS. IN HIS LETTER TO MONTANA CUELLAR, ESCOBAR GAVIRIA SAID HE WAS AMAZED BY HOW EASILY AND QUICKLY THE GOVERNMENT HAS FOUND SOMEONE TO BLAME. STATE SECURITY AGENCY SPOKESMEN SAID ON 22 MARCH THAT THEY HAVE PROOF LINKING ESCOBAR GAVIRIA TO THE ASSASSINATION. THE ASSOCIATED PRESS HAS ALSO RECEIVED TELEPHONE CALLS IN WHICH AN ALLEGED SPOKESMEN OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF JARAMILLO OSSA. IN HIS LETTER TO THE UP, ESCOBAR GAVIRIA DISAVOWS THOSE CALLS, STATING: WHY SHOULD I ATTACK SOMEONE WHO WAS FIRMLY OPPOSED TO COLOMBIA SURRENDERING TO THE UNITED STATES?
DEV-MUC3-1187	LIMA, 23 MAR 90 -- IN VIEW OF THE CONTINUING WAVE OF CRIMES AND TERRORIST ATTACKS, THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT TODAY DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN LIMA AND THE NEIGHBORING PORT OF CALLAO TO SAFEGUARD THE ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR 8 APRIL THIS YEAR. THE INTERIOR MINISTRY HAS ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE ANNOUNCING THAT POLICE FORCES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN "ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN FROM TAKING LEAVE" TO PROTECT POLITICAL CANDIDATES AND CITIZENS IN GENERAL.
DEV-MUC3-1188	LIMA, 16 MAR 90 -- IT WAS REPORTED TODAY THAT MEMBERS OF THE PEASANT DEFENSE PATROL KILLED, WITH CLUBS AND MACHETES, THREE PEASANTS ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED WITH TERRORISTS AND KIDNAPPED 17 OTHERS IN A TOWN OF THE ANDEAN PROVINCE OF AYACUCHO, 576 KM SOUTHEAST OF LIMA. WITNESSES TOLD THE POLICE THAT AT LEAST 300 MILITIAMEN FROM THE VICHOS AND CONDORAY DISTRICTS, 17 KM FROM AYACUCHO, ATTACKED THE SANTA BARBARA VILLAGE EARLY ON 15 MARCH AND OVERPOWERED THE RESIDENTS WITH MACHETES AND CLUBS. WITNESSES SAID THAT THE MILITIA MEMBERS KILLED BROTHERS EFRAIN, ISAAC, AND MAXIMO PRADO, ON CHARGES OF BEING LINKED WITH SHINING PATH TERRORISTS, AND KIDNAPPED 17 ALLEGED SHINING PATH TERRORISTS WHO WERE TAKEN TO AN UNKNOWN PLACE. ACCORDING TO THE POLICE AT LEAST 40 "MEMBERS OF THE PEASANT DEFENSE PATROL" FROM VICHOS AND CONDORAY DIED IN A CLASH WITH TERRORISTS IN JANUARY. THE TERRORISTS THEN HEADED FOR THE NEIGHBORING TOWN OF SANTA BARBARA, WHERE PEASANTS ALLEGEDLY HELPED THEM. THE SOURCE SAID THAT "IF THE CHARGE MADE BY THE PEASANTS IS PROVEN TO BE TRUE, THE REASON FOR THE ATTACK COULD BE IN RETALIATION FOR THE GREAT NUMBER OF PEASANT DEFENSE PATROL MEMBERS KILLED TWO MONTHS AGO." THE SO-CALLED "PEASANT DEFENSE PATROLS" WERE CREATED BY THE ARMY FOUR YEARS AGO TO STRUGGLE AGAINST SHINING PATH TERRORISTS IN DISTANT PLACES WHICH LACK SECURITY FORCES. THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE APPARENTLY DIED IN A CLASH BETWEEN A POLICE PATROL AND A COLUMN OF TERRORISTS IN THE INTERIOR OF THE ANDEAN PROVINCE OF TARMA, 350 KM EAST OF LIMA. THE SOURCE SAID THE FIREFIGHT EARLY YESTERDAY LASTED SEVERAL HOURS AND THAT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE DIED IN THE CLASH DUE TO THE POOR COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS. SENATOR ENRIQUE BERNALEZ, WHO SPECIALIZES IN POLITICAL VIOLENCE, TODAY REPORTED THAT TERRORISM HAS CLAIMED THE LIVES OF AT LEAST 607 PERUVIAN SO FAR THIS YEAR, INCLUDING CIVILIANS AND MILITARY.
DEV-MUC3-1189	MANAGUA , 22 MAR 90 -- RESIDENTS OF THE COUNTRY'S NORTHERN REGION HAVE REPORTED NEW, MASS INFILTRATIONS OF CONTRAS FROM HONDURAS WHO PENETRATE DEEPLY INTO THE MOUNTAINS TO CONTINUE SOWING TERROR AMONG THE AREA'S INHABITANTS. ACCORDING TO MARVIN FLORES, POLITICAL SECRETARY OF THE SANDINIST FRONT , PEASANTS HAVE REPORTED THAT CONTRAS ARE INFILTRATING THROUGH JICARO AND MURRA AND THAT THEY STEAL, KIDNAP, AND MURDER ANYONE WHO DOES NOT COOPERATE WITH THEIR VANDALISM. HE ADDED THAT ANOTHER OBJECTIVE OF THE CONTRA GROUPS IS TO ATTACK POSITIONS OF THE SANDINIST PEOPLE'S ARMY AS PART OF THE PLAN NOT TO SURRENDER THEIR WEAPONS WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR THEM TO DEMOBILIZE AS STIPULATED IN THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS. THE INHABITANTS OF JICARO AND MURRA AND THE PEOPLE'S MILITIAS HAVE STEPPED UP THE REVOLUTIONARY SURVEILLANCE IN VIEW OF THE PRESENCE OF CONTRA GROUPS LED BY REBEL LEADERS DIMAS, OSCAR, AND GREEN.
DEV-MUC3-1190	LIMA, 23 MAR 90 -- A CAR FULL OF DYNAMITE EXPLODED IN FRONT OF THE ECONOMY MINISTRY IN LIMA TODAY, KILLING ONE PERSON AND INJURING FIVE OTHERS. THE POLICE REPORTED THAT SEVERAL OTHER EXPLOSIONS WERE HEARD THROUGHOUT THE CITY. THE SHOCK WAVE OF THE "CAR BOMB" SHATTERED THE WINDOWS ON MANY OF THE 12 FLOORS OF THE ECONOMY MINISTRY AND NEIGHBORING BUILDINGS, ACCORDING TO EYEWITNESSES. THE NATIONAL POLICE REPORTED THAT THE PERSON WHO DIED HAS NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED, WHILE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE INJURED HAD BEEN SELLING TRINKETS AROUND THE BUILDING. ACCORDING TO INITIAL REPORTS, POLICE OFFICERS GUARDING THE ECONOMY MINISTRY WERE NOT INJURED.
DEV-MUC3-1191	LIMA, 16 MAR 90 -- THE MAOIST SHINING PATH TERRORIST ORGANIZATION AND THE TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT ARE STAGING ATTACKS IN AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE PEOPLE BOYCOTT THE 8 APRIL PERUVIAN ELECTIONS. A BOMB EXPLODED EARLY THIS MORNING NEAR THE HOUSE OF HEALTH MINISTER PAUL CARO GAMARRA. CARO'S WIFE SAID THAT THE HOUSE, WHICH IS IN THE PORT OF EL CALLAO, LACKS POLICE PROTECTION. THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE CENTER-RIGHTIST DEMOCRATIC FRONT , WHOSE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IS THE WRITER MARIO VARGAS LLOSA, WAS BOMBED LAST NIGHT. THE MRTA CLAIMED THE ATTACK THROUGH LEAFLETS LEFT AT THE SCENE. THE MRTA ALSO PLANTED EXPLOSIVES AND LEFT LEAFLETS BESIDE FIVE FREDEMO PLACARDS. FORTY MEMBERS OF FREDEMO WERE AT THE HEADQUARTERS, WHICH IS ON AN IMPORTANT LIMA AVENUE, WHEN THE ATTACK OCCURRED. NOBODY WAS INJURED. DAVID CIFUENTES, A DEPUTY CANDIDATE OF THE RULING AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE TODAY SAID THAT THERE IS A TERRORIST PLOT TO KILL THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES. ON 14 MARCH CIFUENTES ESCAPED UNHARMED FROM AN ATTACK ON THE CAR IN WHICH HE WAS TRAVELLING. HIS BODYGUARD DIED IN THE ATTACK WHICH OCCURRED 40 KM FROM THE CITY OF CAJAMARCA. THE TERRORISTS PLACED BIG STONES AT A CURVE IN THE ROAD WHICH CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO RUN OFF THE ROAD. THE ATTACKERS THEN OPENED FIRE ON THE CAR. CIFUENTES FELL OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND BROKE HIS ARM IN TWO PLACES, AND IS NOW IN HOSPITAL. SHINING PATH MEMBERS RECENTLY MURDERED 19 PEOPLE, INCLUDING 10 CHILDREN, IN A SMALL VILLAGE NEAR HUANCAYO CITY, 415 KM SOUTH OF LIMA. THIS ACT CLEARLY SHOWS THAT THE MAOISTS ARE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE KILLING AND DESTROYING. SOME 300 PEOPLE WERE MURDERED BY THE SHINING PATH DURING THE BOYCOTT OF THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS ON 12 NOVEMBER 1989. THE ATTACKS PERPETRATED BY THE MRTA LAST NIGHT BELIES THE ALLEGED ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY WILL CEASE TO USE VIOLENCE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WAS PUBLISHED BY A LOCAL NEWSPAPER TWO DAYS AGO. UNITED LEFT DEPUTY GUSTAVO ESPINOSA, IN A STATEMENT TO THE DAILY ONDA, SAID THAT IF THE MRTA IS TRULY SEEKING A POLITICAL WAY TO TURN IN THEIR WEAPONS "THEY WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE PACIFICATION OF THE COUNTRY." HOWEVER, ESPINOSA SAID THAT ONE CANNOT CONSIDER AN END TO THE VIOLENCE UNTIL THERE IS MORE PROOF OF THEIR ANNOUNCEMENT. DURING THE PAST 10 YEARS, THE SHINING PATH AND THE MRTA HAVE PERPETRATED MORE THAN 16,000 ATTACKS WHICH HAVE CAUSED DAMAGE ESTIMATED AT $10,000. THIS ESTIMATE WAS PREPARED BY THE CONGRESSIONAL COMMISSION IN CHARGE OF ASSESSING THE EFFECTS AND CAUSES OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN PERU. DURING PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA'S TERM OF OFFICE THE TERRORISTS HAVE PERPETRATED 10,621 ATTACKS, WHICH REPRESENTS AN AVERAGE OF MORE THAN SIX ATTACKS PER DAY DURING HIS FIVE YEARS IN POWER. FATAL VICTIMS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE AMOUNT TO APPROXIMATELY 19,000, OF WHICH 700 HAVE DIED DURING 1990.
DEV-MUC3-1192	CLANDESTINE, 22 MAR 90 -- IN PREVIOUS BROADCASTS WE REPORTED HONDURAN TROOP INCURSIONS INTO SALVADORAN TERRITORY. WE HAVE RECEIVED NEW REPORTS OF SUCH INCURSIONS. HONDURAN TROOPS ENTERED 2 KM INSIDE SALVADORAN TERRITORY, IN ZANCUDO VILLAGE, IN THE AREA OF SABANETAS CANTON, PERQUIN JURISDICTION, AT 1200 ON 19 MARCH. THEY TOOK 22-YEAR-OLD GILBERTO MOLASCO, SON OF PATRICIO RODRIGUEZ, AND 17-YEAR-OLD ANDRES ARGUETA, SON OF EMIMESIO ARGUETA. THEY WERE TAKEN FROM THEIR HOMES AND THEIR WHEREABOUTS ARE UNKNOWN. ON 17 MARCH, THE TROOPS ARRIVED IN PALO BLANCO VILLAGE AND THEY SEARCHED THE HOUSE OF LEONOR VELIZ, THREATING TO CAPTURE HER SON, CRISTIANO BENITEZ. THEY BEAT HIM UP, ACCUSING HIM OF BEING A GUERRILLA, AND THEY STOLE THEIR DOCUMENTS AND MONEY. THEY ALSO TOLD THEM NOT TO REPORT THE ACTION TO THE RED CROSS, THREATING TO KILL THEM IF THEY DID SO. THE RESIDENTS OF THESE BORDER VILLAGES ISSUE AN APPEAL TO THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FATE OF THE TWO YOUTHS CAPTURED BY HONDURAN ARMY TROOPS.
DEV-MUC3-1193	LIMA, 25 MAR 90 -- THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT THE "PATRIOTIC LIBERATION FRONT" BOMBED THREE IMPORTANT PUBLIC BUILDINGS IN LIMA TODAY, CAUSING A LOT OF PROPERTY DAMAGE BUT NO CASUALTIES. A POLICE SOURCE REPORTED THAT GROUPS FROM THIS NEW TERRORIST MOVEMENT ATTACKED THE CITY HALL OF SAN JUAN DE MIRAFLORES, ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF LIMA; AN ELECTROLIMA OFFICE; AND AN ENTELPERU OFFICE IN THE MIRAFLORES AND SURCO DISTRICTS OF LIMA. THE SOURCE ADDED: "THIS NEW TERRORIST ORGANIZATION WANTS TO INTIMIDATE THE PEOPLE TO PREVENT THEM FROM EXERCISING THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE ON ELECTION DAY ." IN THESE ELECTIONS THE PEOPLE WILL ELECT THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC, TWO VICE PRESIDENTS, 180 DEPUTIES, AND 60 SENATORS. IT IS BELIEVED THAT AT LEAST 10 MILLION PERUVIANS WILL VOTE. UP TO NOW THE POLICE HAVE ATTRIBUTED THE MOST SERIOUS ATTACKS AND CRIMES TO THE MAOIST "SHINING PATH" GROUP AND THE MARXIST "TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT" . THE "SHINING PATH" AND THE "MRTA" ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS OF AT LEAST 700 PEOPLE THIS YEAR, INCLUDING A DOZEN CANDIDATES FOR CONGRESSIONAL SEATS AND REGIONAL ASSEMBLIES AND SOME THIRTY MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES.
DEV-MUC3-1194	CARACAS , 11 MAR 90 -- ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL GN REPORTS, VENEZUELA, WHERE BANKING IS LOSELY CONTROLLED AND NO LAWS AGAINST MONEY LAUNDERING EXIST, A SYSTEM OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL INVESTIGATIONS IS TO BE ESTABLISHED. GN COMMANDER GENERAL MANUEL IBEDACA ROMERO AGREED TO TALK ABOUT THE TOPIC DURING A RECENT INTERVIEW WITH EL NACIONAL. GENERAL, MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT VENEZUELA'S ALLEGED VULNERABILTY TO THE INTERNATIONAL DRUG TRAFFICKING CARTELS. IS THIS TRUE? IS THERE A DANGER THAT VENEZUELA COULD BECOME AN OPERATIONAL BASE FOR THE COCAINE MAFIA? IS IT TRUE THAT HEAVY INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN DETECTED NEAR THE BORDER AND OTHER AREAS OF THE COUNTRY, WITH MONEY OF WHICH NO ONE KNOWS THE SOURCE? WHAT IS BEING DONE TO CONTROL THIS FLOW OF CAPITAL? I SHARE THIS CONCERN. IT IS VERY SIMPLE: WHEN YOU ARE IN A BUILDING OR A HOUSE AND THERE ARE PROBLEMS IN YOUR NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE, THIS OF COURSE DIRECTLY AFFECTS YOU BECAUSE OF THE UNREST, BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE AN UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION WHERE FOR EXAMPLE, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO TESTIFY. IBEDACA THUS BEGINS HIS EXPLANATIONS WITH A SIMPLE, EASY-TO-UNDERSTAND DOMESTIC ANALOGY. HE ADMITS THAT VENEZUELA "IS IN A SITUATION THAT SHOULD REALLY CATCH OUR ATTENTION, BECAUSE VENEZUELA BORDERS COLOMBIA AND WE KNOW THAT COCA IS PRODUCED MAINLY IN BOLIVIA, PERU, ECUADOR, AND IS PROCESSED IN COLOMBIA. COLOMBIA IS AMERICA'S GREAT COCAINE LABORATORY. DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE RECENTLY SUFFERED HARD SETBACKS THROUGH RECENT ACTIONS BY THE COLOMBIAN ARMY AND NATIONAL POLICE IN WHICH THE HEADS OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND GREAT AMOUNTS OF MONEY AND COCAINE AND A NUMBER OF AIRPLANES HAVE BEEN SEIZED. TO TRANSPORT WHAT IS LEFT, THEY WILL, OF COURSE, HAVE TO LOOK FOR A BETTER PLACE AND THIS IS WHERE WE HAVE SEVERAL VULNERABILITIES." LIKE WHAT? THE EXTENSIVE BORDER, THE PLAINS NEAR IT WITH CLANDESTINE LANDING STRIPS; THE PROXIMITY TO EASY-TO-USE PORTS AND AIRPORTS. THROUGH THE ANTIDRUG TRAFFICKING SERVICES AND TOGETHER WITH THE DISIP AND THE METROPOLITAN POLICE, WE HAVE A PLAN AND WE HAVE TAKEN DEFINITE ACTIONS TO FIGHT IT. AWARE OF THIS, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A SYSTEM OF INVESTMENT CONTROLS IN THESE STATES NEAR COLOMBIA. WE ARE RECEIVING REPORTS OF PROPERTY REGISTRATIONS, BUT WE NEED TO TAKE MORE EFFECTIVE MEASURES, BECAUSE WE NEED GREATER CONTROL AND SUPERVISION IN THIS AREA, ESPECIALLY COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS. IN 1986, THREE YEARS AFTER THE DRUG LAW WENT INTO EFFECT, THE GN'S ANTIDRUG DIVISION MADE A RECORD CONFISCATION OF 29,698 KILOS OF MARIJUANA , A FIGURE THAT DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 1988, AND INCREASED IN 1989. SINCE IT WAS FOUNDED BY GENERAL GERMAN SEPULVEDA SIERRA, THIS OFFICE HAS BEEN IN CHARGE OF COORDINATING AND PLANNING ACTIONS THAT THE GN DEVELOPS AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, EVEN THOUGH IT IS LIMITED BY THE DRUG LAW AS AN ADJUNCT TO THE TRIBUNALS. IN OTHER WORDS, THE FILES MUST BE TURNED OVER TO THE JUDICIAL TECHNICAL POLICE . IT IS CURRENTLY CALLED THE DIRECTORATE OF THE SERVICES AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING AND IS DIRECTED BY BRIGADIER GENERAL RAMON GUILLEN DAVILA, WHO ALSO AGREED TO TALK TO EL NACIONAL. THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS HAS BEEN A JOB OF THE GN DURING ALL OF ITS EXISTENCE. I HAVE BEEN IN IT SINCE I WAS A SUBLIEUTENANT. NOW IT IS CALLED THE "MODERN CRIME" AND ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT WARS TO FIGHT. PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THAT WAR, THE BIG COLOMBIAN TRAFFICKERS HAVE PROPOSED TO THEIR COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENT FORMULAS TO ACHIEVE PEACE AND RETIRE FROM THE DRUG BUSINESS. ARE THESE PROPOSALS FROM THE DRUG CARTELS SINCERE? WE ASKED THE GENERAL. I THINK THAT IT IS ONLY A STRATEGY TO GAIN TIME AND SEEK THEIR OWN SOLUTIONS. IT IS NOT STRANGE THAT THEY ARE PRETENDING TO TURN VENEZUELA INTO AN "OPERATIONAL BASE." THERE IS DEMOCRACY AND LIBERTY OF MOVEMENT AND INVESTMENT HERE. IN JUST SAN ANTONIO DEL TACHIRA, THERE ARE 76 EXCHANGE HOUSES AND ONLY ONE MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW. WHEN WE HAVE PRESSURED THE PERACAL TAX REGISTRY, WE GOT COMPLAINTS FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE. THE VENEZUELAN AIR AND HIGHWAY SYSTEM IS VERY FAVORABLE TO THEM. NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES CONNECT WITH EUROPE THROUGH VENEZUELA. A LOT OF MERCHANDISE GOES THROUGH IN TRANSIT, AND WHEN THEY SEIZE A SHIPMENT, WHAT THEY SAY IS THAT THE AIRPLANE "CAME FROM VENEZUELA."
DEV-MUC3-1195	LIMA, 27 MAR 90 -- THE ATTACKS ON FIVE OFFICES OF THE DEMOCRATIC FRONT , WHICH IS HEADED BY MARIO VARGAS LLOSA, ON THE OFFICE OF THE RULING AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE, APRA, AND AGAINST ONE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE, TWO BANKS, ONE STORE, AND ONE MOVIE THEATER, SHOW THAT TERRORISM IN PERU CONTINUES TO BE USED IN AN ATTEMPT TO BOYCOTT THE 8 APRIL ELECTIONS. ONE GIRL WAS WOUNDED DURING THE EXPLOSIONS THAT OCCURRED IN LIMA YESTERDAY, AND FOUR INDIVIDUALS WERE ARRESTED WHILE LOOTING TWO SHOE STORES AND A MARKET AND URGING PEOPLE TO JOIN THEM. THE ATTACKS SERIOUSLY DAMAGED THE OFFICES OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES, ESPECIALLY THAT OF THE FREDEMO, BUT NO ONE WAS INJURED. THE PAGINA LIBRE NEWSPAPER TODAY REPORTED THAT SEVEN ALLEGED MEMBERS OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY LEFT WERE ARRESTED IN THE CITY OF TRUJILLO, 570 KM NORTH OF LIMA. THE MIR IS A FACTION OF THE PRO-GUEVARA TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT . THE MAOIST SHINING PATH TERRORIST ORGANIZATION HAS CALLED FOR "AN ARMED STRIKE" -- A STRIKE UNDER THREAT OF DEATH -- IN LIMA TOMORROW. THIS IS THE THIRD ARMED STRIKE TO BE CALLED BY THIS ORGANIZATION SO FAR THIS MONTH. A 48-HOUR ARMED STRIKE WAS CALLED IN AYACUCHO, THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE SHINING PATH ORGANIZATION AND THE OTHER ONE IN HUANTA. PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA YESTERDAY DELIVERED 170 PATROL CARS TO THE NATIONAL POLICE. HE URGED THE POLICE TO RESOLUTELY FACE THE INCREASING WAVE OF TERRORISM AND TO MAKE USE OF ALL AVAILABLE RESOURCES. THE NATIONAL POLICE YESTERDAY COMMISSIONED A SQUAD OF 16 MOTORCYCLES TO PATROL THE CITY AND TO GO DIRECTLY TO THE SITES OF ATTACKS. IT IS EXPECTED THAT SUBVERSIVES WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ATTACKS IN A WAVE OF TERROR BEFORE THE ELECTIONS AND THIS IS WHY THE POLICE AND MILITARY FORCES HAVE BEEN PUT ON ALERT. ABOUT 100,000 POLICEMEN HAVE BEEN PUT ON ALERT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY FOLLOWING THE MURDER LAST WEEK OF FOUR CANDIDATES FOR DEPUTIES, AN APRA LEADER, AND THE MANAGERS OF SEVERAL BUSINESSES IN LIMA, AND OTHER CITIES. LIMA AND CALLAO HAVE BEEN PLACED IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY, WHICH MEANS THAT INDIVIDUAL GUARANTEES HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED. YESTERDAY AYACUCHO WAS LEFT IN DARKNESS AFTER A SHINING PATH ATTACK. AT LEAST THREE PEOPLE WERE KILLED, SEVERAL WERE WOUNDED, AND VARIOUS ARRESTS WERE MADE BY THE POLICE. YESTERDAY WAS THE MOST VIOLENT DAY IN AYACUCHO SINCE LAST NOVEMBER WHEN MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS WERE HELD. THE ELECTIONS WERE THEN ANNULLED BECAUSE OF THE HIGH NUMBER OF NULL AND BLANK VOTES. LAST WEEK IN HUANCAYO, 415 KM SOUTHEAST OF LIMA, AN APRA CANDIDATE FOR DEPUTY WAS MURDERED. YESTERDAY AN INDIVIDUAL WAS WOUNDED WHEN A CAR BOMB EXPLODED CAUSING EXTENSIVE MATERIAL DAMAGE. YESTERDAY IN CHICLAYO, IN NORTHERN PERU, A BOMB WAS THROWN AT THE HOUSE OF FREDEMO CANDIDATE FOR DEPUTY MIGUEL ANGEL BARTRA, WHO WAS NOT IN THE HOUSE AT THE TIME. IN LA LIBERTAD DEPARTMENT A TERRORIST GROUP TOOK OVER THE GUADALUPITO TOWN EARLY YESTERDAY MORNING IN AN EFFORT TO FIND THE LOCAL APRA SECRETARY GENERAL AND THE TOWN'S MAYOR. WHEN THE TERRORISTS COULD NOT FIND THEM, THEY BLEW UP THE OFFICES OF THE MUNICIPALITY AND THE POWER STATION CAUSING AN OUTAGE IN THE ZONE. THE STRIKES AFFECTING 100,000 WORKERS IN THE COUNTRY CONTINUE AND THE STRIKERS HAVE REJECTED THE "LABOR TRUCE" UNTIL THE ELECTIONS ARE OVER THAT HAD BEEN REQUESTED BY INTERIOR MINISTER AGUSTIN MANTILLA. MANTILLA SAID THAT THE STRIKES "ARE BORDERING ON THE SEDITIOUS AND THE CRIMINAL." IN THE LAST 10 YEARS POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN PERU HAS CAUSED 19,000 DEATHS, OF WHICH 700 HAVE OCCURRED SO FAR THIS YEAR.
DEV-MUC3-1196	PANAMA CITY , 29 MAR 90 -- THERE WAS AN EXCHANGE OF GUNFIRE THIS MORNING AT PUERTO OBALDIA, NEAR THE COLOMBIAN BORDER, WHICH LEFT TWO PERSONS DEAD AND ONE MISSING. ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY REPORTS, ONE OF THE PERSONS KILLED WAS A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC FORCES, BUT HE HAS NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED. THE OTHER PERSON KILLED WAS A COLOMBIAN.
DEV-MUC3-1197	BOGOTA, 29 MAR 90 -- THE REFORMIST SECTOR OF THE LEFTIST PATRIOTIC UNION TODAY RESIGNED FROM THE PARTY'S NATIONAL COORDINATING BOARD, CREATING AN UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS IN ITS FIVE YEARS OF POLITICAL LIFE. DURING THE SECOND DAY OF ITS PLENUM, TWELVE OF ITS 20 MEMBERS, INCLUDING UP PRESIDENT DIEGO MONTANA CUELLAR, RESIGNED FROM THE NATIONAL COORDINATING BOARD, WHICH ALSO INCLUDES ACTIVISTS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF COLOMBIA . ACCORDING TO SOURCES CLOSE TO THE UP, THE REFORMIST FACTION RESIGNED FROM THE COORDINATING BOARD BECAUSE IT BELIEVES THAT WHAT IS NEEDED IN COLOMBIA IS A BROAD SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT, SUCH AS THAT ADVOCATED BY UP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA, WHO WAS ASSASSINATED ON 22 MARCH. THE LEFTIST SOURCES CONSULTED BY EFE INDICATED TODAY THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF PARTICIPATING IN THE 27 MAY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, AT LEAST WITH A JOINT UP AND PCC CANDIDATE, IS GROWING MORE DISTANT. WHILE THE UP'S REFORMIST FACTION REJECTS THE ARMED PATH AS A MEANS TO ACHIEVE POWER, THE SECTOR KNOWN AS THE RADICALS, IN OTHER WORDS, THE EIGHT MEMBERS WHO DID NOT RESIGN FROM THE COORDINATING BOARD, AGREE ON USING DIFFERENT FORMS OF STRUGGLE, INCLUDING GUERRILLA STRUGGLE. THE EIGHT MEMBERS WHO DID NOT RESIGN BELONG TO THE PCC. IN ADDITION TO MONTANA, LEADERS ANGELINO GARZON, GUILLERMO BANGUERO, ALBERTO ROJAS PUYO, JULIO SANTANA, AND LUIS EMIRO VALENCIA WERE AMONG THOSE WHO RESIGNED. AT THE SAME TIME, 12 MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE, ANOTHER SECTION OF THE PARTY, ALSO RESIGNED. THEY ARE ALSO FROM THE REFORMIST FACTION. THE FRICTION WITH THE REFORMISTS OR PERESTROYKA SUPPORTERS BEGAN ON 28 MARCH, THE FIRST DAY OF SESSIONS OF THE PLENUM, WHEN ANGELINO GARZON CHARGED THAT THE PCC HAD INTERCEPTED JARAMILLO OSSA'S LETTERS. ANOTHER REASON FOR THE DIVISION WITHIN THE COLOMBIAN LEFT WAS THE NOT VERY FAVORABLE RESULTS IN THE 11 MARCH LEGISLATIVE AND MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS, WHEN THE UP AND THE PCC LOST SEVERAL SEATS IN THE COLOMBIAN CONGRESS. UP TO 22 MARCH, THE DAY WHEN JARAMILLO WAS ASSASSINATED, HE WAS THE SINGLE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THE UP AND THE PCC, BUT AFTER HIS DEATH, BOTH PARTIES AGREED TO HOLD A PLENUM TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS.
DEV-MUC3-1198	MOSCOW , 27 MAR 90 -- OBVIOUS PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN SOLVING THE REGIONAL CONFLICT IN CENTRAL AMERICA. VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ WILL MEDIATE A MEETING IN CARACAS BETWEEN SALVADORAN REBELS AND A GOVERNMENT DELEGATION. CONFIDENTIAL NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN GUATEMALAN GUERRILLAS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION COMMISSION WILL ALSO BE HELD IN THE NORWEGIAN CAPITAL, OSLO. LISTEN WHAT OUR COMMENTATOR LEONID LEVCHEKO HAS TO SAY: THESE TWO MEETINGS HAVE ONE POINT IN COMMON: BOTH HAVE BEEN MADE POSSIBLE THANKS TO THE INITIATIVE AND THE MEDIATION OF THE MOST DIVERSE CIRCLES, WHICH ARE INTERESTED IN PUTTING OUT THE FIRE IN CENTRAL AMERICA. THE CARACAS MEETING COINCIDES WITH THE START TODAY OF THE OFFICIAL VISIT BY SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI. VENEZUELAN CHIEF OF STATE CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, WHO WELCOMED CRISTIANI, HAS ALREADY HELD TALKS WITH THE SALVADORAN REBELS DELEGATION. THE VENEZUELAN CHIEF OF STATE WILL ACT AS MEDIATOR IN THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS WHEN THEY SIT AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE. THE OSLO MEETING WAS CONCEIVED AT THE INITIATIVE OF THE LUTHERAN AND CATHOLIC CHURCHES. THIS IS A BIG ADVANCE IF ONE CONSIDERS THAT THE FIRST AND LAST DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS TOOK PLACE IN OCTOBER 1987 IN SPAIN. THEY WERE THEN SUSPENDED AND NEVER RESUMED. BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY TO ADVANCE TOWARD NATIONAL RECONCILIATION IN ALL THE COUNTRIES INVOLVED IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN CONFLICT. BEFORE THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED IN 1967 BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, MANY INTERNATIONAL FORCES, WHICH HINDERED A SOLUTION, WERE INVOLVED IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN CONFLICT. THE MILITARY CHIEFS OF EL SALVADOR AND GUATEMALA ALSO REJECTED THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS, ASSUMING THAT THEY COULD DEFEAT THE REBEL MOVEMENT. IN FACT, DURING 10 YEARS OF CIVIL WAR MORE THAN 70,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN EL SALVADOR AND IN NEARLY 30 YEARS OF CONFLICT IN GUATEMALA MORE THAN 100,000 HAVE BEEN KILLED. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE FRATRICIDAL WAR IS ABSURD BOTH IN EL SALVADOR AND IN GUATEMALA. IT IS TIME THAT, FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLE OF NICARAGUA, OTHER COUNTRIES CONTRIBUTE TO RESTORE PEACE IN THE AREA. THIS IS WHY THE REPORTS COMING FROM CARACAS AND OSLO HAVE BEEN GREETED WITH GREAT INTEREST. IT IS CLEAR THAT A JUST SOLUTION IS POSSIBLE IN CENTRAL AMERICA IF ONLY THE PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW ARE STRICTLY FOLLOWED AND THE COUNTRIES' SOVEREIGNTY IS RESPECTED BY NOT MEDDLING IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF OTHER STATES. THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF THE SOVIET VIEW ON CENTRAL AMERICA.
DEV-MUC3-1199	NO CITY, NO DATE -- BOGOTA DOMESTIC SERVICE IN SPANISH AT 0230 GMT BEGINS TO BROADCAST LIVE OR RECORDED A SPEECH BY PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS FROM THE NARINO PALACE IN BOGOTA. RECEPTION IS FAIR TO POOR. BARCO BEGINS HIS ADDRESS BY EXPRESSING HIS CONCERN OVER THE DISNFORMATION CAMPAIGN SURROUNDING THE RECENT EVENTS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE. HE GOES ON TO CITE THE VARIOUS ITEMS BEING PUBLISHED BY THE COUNTRY'S MEDIA CONCERNING SECRET DEALINGS WITH DRUG TRAFFICKERS, A RELAXATION OF ACTIONS AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, AND OTHER STORIES WHICH HE INSISTS ARE NOT TRUE. HE BLAMES NARCOTERRORISM FOR THE VIOLENCE AND CONFUSION WARNS THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO BLAME THE GOVERNMENT. BARCO NOTES THAT THE GOVERNMENT RESPECTS THE MEDIA AND SUGGESTS THAT PUBLIC OPINION IS BEING MANIPULATED. HE THEN TOUCHES ON THE CONTROVERSY REGARDING THE KIDNAPPING OF THE SON OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY. BARCO SAYS: "THE GOVERNMENT, IN THE CASE OF THE KIDNAPPING OF DR. MONTOYA'S SON, AS ON OTHER UNFORTUNATE OCCASIONS, INCLUDING THE CASES OF DR. ANDRES PASTRANA AND DR. ALVARO GOMEZ, AND EVEN CASES IN WHICH MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN KDNAPPED BY SUBVERSIVES, HAS CONSIDERED AS APPROPRIATE AND VALUABLE THE EFFORTS MADE BY THOSE WHO PERFORMED HUMANITARIAN DUTIES AND SHOWED GOOD WILL FOR THEIR RELEASE." HE ADDS THAT NEITHER THE SECURITY COUNCIL NOR THE PRESIDENT CAN BE PREVENTED FROM ASCERTAINING INFORMATION WHICH COULD LEAD TO THE RELEASE OF HOSTAGES. BARCO SAYS THAT THE STRUGGLE AGAINST NARCOTERRORISM HAS NOT BEEN EASY. HE ADDS THAT KEEPING THE HOPES OF THE NATION ALIVE, RATHER THAN ENHANCING THE COUNTRY'S IMAGE, IS THE GOAL. HE ADDS THAT THE COUNTRY WILL NOT SURVIVE WITH ITS PROBLEMS, NOTING HIS UPCOMING EUROPEAN TRIP TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE DANGERS OF DRUG TRAFFICKING AND TO REAFFIRM THE COUNTRY'S GOOD NAME. IN ENDING HIS ADDRESS, BARCO URGES CALM AND WARNS AGAINST DIVISION, ADDING THAT THIS IS THE GOAL OF THE ENEMIES OF THE FATHERLAND. HE URGES EVERYONE TO DEFEND THEIR DEMOCRACY. BARCO ENDS HIS ADDRESS AT 0250 GMT. FURTHER AS WARRANTED.
DEV-MUC3-1200	BOGOTA, 31 MAR 90 -- 1. ON 28 MARCH 1990, THE ARMY AND THE NATIONAL POLICE ELITE CORPS CARRIED OUT MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE HIGHER PARTS OF ENVIGADO MUNICIPALITY. 2. IN SAID OPERATIONS, THE ELITE CORPS ARRESTED COLOMBIAN CITIZENS FREDDY LOPEZ OSPINA AND JOSE CRISTANTO RETAVISTA ARZON, WHO REMAIN MISSING. 3. IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS IN MEDELLIN, IT HAS BEEN THE CUSTOM OF THE ELITE CORPS TO ARREST PEOPLE AND TAKE THEM TO THE CARLOS HOLGUIN POLICE ACADEMY, WHERE THEY ARE TORTURED AND EXECUTED BY MEMBERS OF THE BOGOTA DIJIN , WHO ARE IN THE CAPITAL OF ANTIOQUIA. 4. WE HAVE DENOUNCED THESE EVENTS PUBLICLY ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, BUT PRESIDENT BARCO HAS RESPONDED IN STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS THAT THOSE MEMBERS OF THE ELITE CORPS ARE DEFENDERS OF DEMOCRACY. 5. THE COMMANDER OF THE ELITE CORPS IN ANTIOQUIA, AND COLONEL PELAEZ, CHIEF OF THE BOGOTA DIJIN, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER OF ALL OUR COMRADES AND FOR THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE TWO AFOREMENTIONED CITIZENS. 6. IN PREVIOUS COMMUNIQUES, WE PUBLICLY REQUESTED THE CREATION OF SEPARATE PRISONS AND THE PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT OF A BRANCH OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IN SUCH PRISONS, BUT THE GOVERNMENT, AN ACCOMPLICE, HAS BEEN SILENT WITH REGARD TO OUR PROPOSALS. 7. IF THE CITIZENS WHO WERE ARRESTED IN ENVIGADO ARE NOT PRESENTED TO THEIR RESPECTIVE FAMILIES, IN REPRISAL WE WILL PLACE A BOMB CONTAINING 5,000 KG OF DYNAMITE IN ONE OF THE MAIN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE BOGOTA OLIGARCHY. 8. FOR EACH COLOMBIAN WHO IS TURNED OVER TO THE UNITED STATES, WE WILL PLACE A 5,000-KG BOMB IN THE CAPITAL OF THE REPUBLIC. 9. WE WILL EXECUTE PROGOVERNMENT JUDGES, TRAITOROUS POLITICIANS, TORTURERS, AND THE MAIN MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY. THE EXTRADITABLES, 30 MARCH 1990
DEV-MUC3-1201	SAN SALVADOR, 2 APR 90 -- OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT FIVE POLICEMEN AND A CIVILIAN WERE KILLED, AND AT LEAST 24 SOLDIERS INJURED WHEN A VEHICLE LOADED WITH EXPLOSIVES EXPLODED ON 2 APRIL NEAR A POLICE PRECINCT LOCATED ON THE SOUTHWESTERN OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR. THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE CONFIRMED THAT THE TERRORIST ATTACK OCCURRED AT 0615 ON MONDAY IN SANTA TECLA, 12 KM FROM THE CAPITAL. THE OFFICIAL REPORT REVEALS THAT A COMPANY OF POLICEMEN FROM THE TECHNICAL POLICE INSTRUCTION CENTER, AN AGENCY OF THE NATIONAL POLICE, WAS EXERCISING NEAR THE PRECINCT WHEN A POWERFUL EXPLOSIVE CHARGE IN A PICK-UP TRUCK WENT OFF AS THE POLICEMAN WENT BY. A COPREFA SPOKESMAN HAS SUGGESTED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS PROBABLY ACTIVATED BY REMOTE CONTROL BY A GUERRILLA UNIT.
DEV-MUC3-1202	CLANDESTINE, 2 APR 90 -- PRESIDENTS DANIEL ORTEGA SAAVEDRA, OSCAR ARIAS SANCHEZ, RAFAEL LEONARDO CALLEJAS, MARCO VINICIO CEREZO AREVELO, ALFREDO CRISTIANI: IN EL SALVADOR A SERIOUS DIALOGUE-NEGOTIATION PROCESS HAS BEGUN THANKS TO THE MEDIATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS THROUGH ITS SECRETARY GENERAL MR. JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR. THIS IMPLIES THAT ANY PEACE FORMULA MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THIS NEGOTIATION PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT IT IS BASED ON OUR PARTICULAR REALITY AND THE GUARANTEES OFFERED BY THIS INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION. WE BELIEVE THAT THE NEGOTIATION'S MAIN OBJECTIVE SHOULD BE THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIZATION, BECAUSE WHILE PEACEFUL CENTRAL AMERICAN AND WORLD DEVELOPMENTS ARE MARKED BY A CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY, EL SALVADOR IS QUITE FAR FROM EXPERIENCING THIS. THE ARMY HOLDS SOCIETY'S REAL POWER. THIS PREVENTS JUSTICE BEING APPLIED IN THE HORRENDOUS ASSASSINATIONS OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO, JESUIT PRIESTS, FENASTRAS MEMBERS, AND DR. HECTOR OQUELI. UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS, IMPUNITY CONTINUES TO BE INSTITUTIONALIZED AND IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ENFORCE RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. DAILY LIFE IS MARKED BY REPRESSION AGAINST THE POPULAR MOVEMENT AN FREQUENT MURDERS, WHILE ARENA APPLIES PRESSURES AND FORCES, BY VARIOUS MEANS, THE RESTRICTION OF INFORMATION TO THE MEDIA BY LIMITING FREEDOM OF SPEECH. IT IS THEREFORE EVIDENT THAT EL SALVADOR IS THE COUNTRY THAT HAS FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THE MAIN GOALS OF ESQUIPULAS II -- THE ACHIEVEMENT OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATION, DEMOCRATIZATION, AND A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION. THIS SITUATION, WHICH IS ACCOMPANIED BY A PERMANENT STATE OF SIEGE IS WORSENED BY GREAT RESTRICTIONS ON THE POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OF CIVILIAN SOCIETY. IT SUFFICES TO MENTION THE CASE OF THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM: IN NICARAGUA, A COUNTRY WITH HALF OF OUR COUNTRY'S POPULATION, THE SUPREME ELECTORAL COUNCIL REGISTERED 1.9 MILLION CITIZENS IN ONLY FOUR SUNDAYS; IN EL SALVADOR, IN EIGHT YEARS, THE ELECTORAL REGISTRY REGISTERED 1.6 MILLION CITIZENS FOR THE RECENT ELECTIONS AND ONLY 1 MILLION ACTUALLY VOTED.
DEV-MUC3-1203	CLANDESTINE, 2 APR 90 -- IN CONTRAST, EL SALVADOR, WHICH HAS THE SECOND LARGEST POPULATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA, HAS THE SMALLEST PARLIAMENT WITH ONLY 60 DEPUTIES. THE SOCIAL CONFLICT IS WORSENED BY A WAR THAT NO ONE HAS WON. THE TIME HAS COME TO LET CIVILIAN SOCIETY WIN. TO ACHIEVE THAT WE REQUIRE: -- THE PURGING, RESTRUCTURING, AND REDUCTION OF THE ARMY AND MOVEMENT TOWARD A CIVILIAN SOCIETY, AN ABSOLUTELY DEMILITARIZED SOCIETY. -- THE END OF IMPUNITY THROUGH THE TRIAL AND PUNISHMENT OF THE MASTERMINDS AND PERPETRATORS OF THE ASSASSINATION OF MSGR ROMERO, FENASTRAS MEMBERS, JESUIT PRIESTS, AND DR. OQUELI. THESE TRIALS ARE THE FOUNDATION THAT WILL ENSURE THAT REFORM OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS CREDIBLE. -- GUARANTEES OF THE FRAMEWORK OF DEMOCRATIC LIBERTIES. -- VIA A PLESBICITE IN THE 1991 ELECTIONS, THAT THE NEXT ASSEMBLY IMPLEMENT AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION, SUCH AS THE EXPANSION OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY AND THE CREATION OF A CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE DEMILITARIZATION OF SOCIETY. -- REFORM OF THE ELECTORAL SYTEM TO REGISTER, BY MAY THIS YEAR AT THE LATEST, NEARLY 3 MILLION ELIGIBLE SALVADORAN VOTERS TO ALLOW THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THE 1991 ELECTIONS. -- THE CARRYING OUT OF THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS WITHOUT A MILITARY PRESENCE AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS AT LEAST SIX MONTHS BEFORE AND UNTIL THE INSTALLATION OF THE NEW ASSEMBLY. THE FMLN IS WILLING TO REACH ACCORDS ON ALL THESE ISSUES AND TO IMPLEMENT SIMULTANEOUS STEPS FROM A DE-INTENSIFICATION OF THE WAR AND AN END OF HOSTILITIES TO ACCORDS TO END THE ARMED CONFLICT AND THE REINCORPORATION OF OUR FORCES INTO POLITICAL LIFE IN KEEPING WITH AND PARALLEL TO THE AFOREMENTIONED MEASURES TAKING PLACE. WE EXPRESS OUR WILLINGNESS TO FULLY SUPPORT A NATIONAL REGISTRATIO DRIVE TO GIVE ALL ELIGIBLE SALVADORAN VOTERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE AND CONTRIBUTE TOWARD ENSURING THAT THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS, AS WAS THE CASE IN NICARAGUA, WILL HELP ESTABLISH THE BASES FOR LASTING PEACE. PRESIDENTS: THE FMLN'S OBJECTIVES ARE DEMOCRATIZATION, RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, ESTABLISHMENT OF A GENUINE LEGAL STATE, DEMILITARIZATION, AND ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICY AS THE ONLY MEANS TO ENSURE THAT OUR PEOPLE WILL PEACEFULLY MOVE UP TO BETTER LEVELS OF WELL-BEING AND DEVELOPMENT. IN THIS REGARD, WE BELIEVE THAT YOUR BEST CONTRIBUTION WOULD BE TO HELP PROMOTE DEMOCRATIZATION IN EL SALVADOR AND TO ADVOCATE A NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS THAT IS BEGUN AT THE UNITED NATIONS. FMLN GENERAL COMMAND: COMMANDERS SALVADOR SANCHEZ CEREN, FRANCISCO JOVEL, SHAFICK JORGE HANDAL, EDUARDO SANCHO, AND JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS.
DEV-MUC3-1204	BOGOTA, 31 MAR 90 -- KIDNAPPING IS ONE OF COLOMBIA'S MOST PROFITABLE INDUSTRIES TO THE EXTENT THAT, ACCORDING TO POLICE STATISTICS, FOUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED EVERY DAY SO FAR IN 1990, A FIGURE DOUBLE THAT OF THE SAME PERIOD IN 1989. THE JUDICIAL POLICE AND INVESTIGATIONS DIRECTORATE THIS WEEK REPORTED THAT 326 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED FOR EXTORTION PURPOSES SO FAR THIS YEAR. DIJIN SAID THAT THE NUMBER OF KIDNAPPINGS IN THIS PERIOD DOUBLED THE NUMBER OF KIDNAPPINGS DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN 1989. ACCORDING TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY , IN 1989, CATTLEMEN PAID 2 BILLION PESOS TO KIDNAPPERS AND BLACKMAILERS WHO THREATENED CAPTURING OR ASSASSINATING THEM IF THEY FAILED TO PAY. ACCORDING TO DAS, GUERRILLAS OR CRIMINALS STOLE 10,000 HEAD OF CATTLE IN 1989 AND HAVE STOLEN 1,500 OF THE ANIMALS SO FAR IN 1990. SOURCES CONSULTED BY EFE, BOTH POLICE SOURCES AND THOSE WHO STUDY THE COLOMBIAN REALITY, HAVE POINTED OUT THAT GUERRILLAS PARTICIPATE IN 20 TO 30 PERCENT OF THE KIDNAPPING BUSINESS AND COMMON CRIMINALS IN 70 TO 80 PERCENT. THESE PERCENTAGES OF PARTICIPATION IN THE INDUSTRY OF KIDNAPPING ARE ONLY ESTIMATES NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CHECK BECAUSE IN MANY CASES GUERRILLAS KIDNAP PEOPLE TO FINANCE THEIR ACTIVITIES AND DO NOT CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT. IN ADDITION, MANY PEOPLE ARE KIDNAPPED BY COMMON CRIMINALS, BUT THE CRIME IS REPORTED AS BEING PERPETRATED BY GUERRILLAS IN AN ATTEMPT TO COVER UP THE MALEFACTOR'S ACTIONS. ACCORDING TO THE DAS, CORDOBA, IN THE COUNTRY'S NORTHEAST, IS THE DEPARTMENT MOST AFFECTED BY THIS KIND OF CRIME. OTHER HARD HIT DEPARTMENTS ARE ANTIOQUIA IN THE NORTHWEST, SANTANDER IN THE NORTHEAST, AND CAUCA IN THE SOUTHWEST. ACCORDING TO THE DAS REPORT, THE SITUATION HAS BECOME SO UNTENABLE THAT ITS SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESTORE SOCIAL BALANCE IN CORDOBA ON A MID-TERM BASIS BECAUSE THE POPULATION HAS ACCUSTOMED ITSELF TO COEXISTING WITH THESE IRREGULARITIES OR REPULSING THEM WITH MECHANISMS OTHER THAN THOSE STIPULATED BY LAW. MECHANISMS OTHER THAN THOSE STIPULATED BY LAW REFERRED TO BY THE DAS ARE USUALLY CATTLEMEN ORGANIZING THEMSELVES INTO SELF-DEFENSE PARAMILITARY GROUPS OR DEATH SQUADS. THESE PARAMILITARY GROUPS DEFEND THEIR PROPERTIES OR MOUNT RAIDS AGAINST PEASANTS CONSIDERED ACCOMPLICES OR INFORMANTS OF LEFTIST GUERRILLAS OR COMMON CRIMINALS WHO BLACKMAIL THEM. ACCORDING TO THE DAS, ONE OF THE CAUSES OF THIS SITUATION IS SOCIAL DISRUPTION AND THE PRECARIOUS ECONOMIC SITUATION OF THE COMMUNITIES LOCATED IN MUNICIPALITIES AND LOCALITIES THAT LACK THE MOST BASIC SERVICES, A REALITY THAT IS MOST GLARING IN CORDOBA. FIVE GUERRILLA GROUPS ARE ACTIVE IN COLOMBIA. THE MOST BELLIGERENT AND THE ONE THAT HAS USED KIDNAPPING TO THE FULLEST EXTENT IS THE PRO-CASTRO NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY . THE OTHER GROUPS ARE THE COMMUNIST REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA , THE MAOIST PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY , THE INDIGENIST QUINTIN LAME, AND THE TROTSKYIST REVOLUTIONARY WORKERS' PARTY .
DEV-MUC3-1205	MADRID , 2 APR 90 -- THE GUATEMALAN VICE PRESIDENT ARRIVED IN MADRID THIS AFTERNOON. ON HIS ARRIVAL HE SPOKE TO OUR CORRESPONDENT, HECTOR ARENAS, AT BARAJAS AIRPORT. GUATEMALAN VICE PRESIDENT ROBERTO CARPIO WHO IS NOW IN SPAIN SAID THAT HIS GOVERNMENT SUPORTS THE CONCILIATION COUNCIL MEETING TAKING PLACE IN OSLO, WHERE TALKS ARE BEING HELD WITH THE GUATEMALAN GUERRILLAS TO PUT AN END TO THE CLIMATE OF VIOLENCE WHICH THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING FOR YEARS; SCORES OF PEOPLE ARE DEAD OR MISSING. ACCORDING TO VICE PRESIDENT CARPIO THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION TODAY IN NO WAY JUSTIFIES TERRORIST ACTIONS OR ARMED MOVEMENTS. ...THIS IS GOOD PROGRESS AND IN THIS CONNECTION TO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR COUNTRIES HAVE CHANGED. IT IS NOT THE GUATEMALA OF FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO, WHEN THERE WERE AUTOCRATIC AND MILITARY REGIMES. TODAY WE ARE IN A PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIZATION AND IN THIS CONNECTION WE ALL OUGHT TO INVOLVE OURSELVES IN IT. THEREFORE, I THINK, THIS IS THE BEGINING OF SOMETHING WHICH COULD END THE ARMED STRUGGLE IN GUATEMALA, AS IT SHOULD ALSO END THROUGHOUT ALL CENTRAL AMERICA.
DEV-MUC3-1206	BOGOTA, 3 APR 90 -- DURING THE SEARCHES TODAY IN MEDELLIN, THE CAPITAL OF ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, THE AUTHORITIES DISCOVERED WHAT THEY HAVE TERMED AS A VERY IMPORTANT COMMUNICATIONS CENTER OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL. AS PART OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE OPERATIONS, IN RESPONSE TO THE ATTACKS AGAINST ARMY MEMBERS IN MEDELLIN, THE AUTHORITIES TODAY DISMANTLED A COMMUNICATIONS CENTER BELONGING TO THE MEDELLIN CARTEL. IN A RESIDENCE LOCATED IN EL POBLADO NEIGHBORHOOD, THE AUTHORITIES FOUND 15 PORTABLE COMMUNICATION RADIOS; TWO CORDLESS TELEPHONES; TWO MAGNETIC ANTENNAS FOR RADIOS; THREE ICOM RECEIVERS; SEVEN BATTERIES; 12 ANTENNAS FOR PORTABLE RADIOS; FIVE VOLTAGE REGULATORS; AND FOUR ADAPTERS. ACCORDING TO THE POLICE REPORT, DOCUMENTS LINKING SEVERAL PEOPLE WITH THE ASSASSINATIONS OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN SARMIENTO, BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA, AND OF COLONEL VALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO WERE FOUND AT THE MEDELLIN CARTEL COMMUNICATIONS CENTER, AS WELL AS DOCUMENTS ABOUT THE PERPETRATORS OF THE ATTACK ON THE DAS HEADQUARTERS IN BOGOTA, AND AGAINST THE AVIANCA HK1803 PLANE. POLICE SOURCES REPORTED THAT NO ARRESTS WERE MADE.
DEV-MUC3-1207	SAN SALVADOR, 3 APR 90 -- WHAT IS THE POSITION OF THE ARMED FORCES CONCERNING THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT IN NICARAGUA AND THE UPCOMING DIALOGUE TO BE HELD IN GENEVA BETWEEN THE REBELS AND THE GOVERNMENT? WILL THE ARMED FORCES SEEK SUPPORT FOR THE DIALOGUE AND A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT? LAST WEEK THE ARMED FORCES RELEASED A PUBLIC MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE EXPLAINING THEIR STAND AND MENTIONING THREE BASIC POINTS: FIRST, THE ARMED FORCES SUPPORT A DIALOGUE THAT SEEKS PEACE IN THE COUNTRY THROUGH MECHANISMS OF UNDERSTANDING AND AGREEMENT. SECOND, THE ARMED FORCES EXPRESS THEIR LOYALTY TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC IN THESE EFFORTS AND OTHER EFFORTS HE MAY UNDERTAKE TO FIND THE PEACE WE ALL CHERISH IN THIS COUNTRY. THIRD, WE POSSESS THE MORAL CONVICTION AND THE OBEDIENCE -- AS ORDERED BY THE CONSTITUTION -- AS WELL AS THE HUMANISTIC AWARENESS TO PROMOTE AND PROTECT THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF ALL SALVADORANS. THOSE ARE THE BASIC POINTS INCLUDED IN OUR MESSAGE TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE THAT WE ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK. AS FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT BEING HELD IN NICARAGUA, THE ARMED FORCES WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THE EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN BY OUR GOVERNMENT TO FIND THE MECHANISMS THAT WILL LEAD US TO PEACE IN THE REGION. THAT IS WHY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS OUR FULL SUPPORT IN THIS ENDEAVOUR FOR FINDING PEACE AND DEMOCRACY THROUGHOUT CENTRAL AMERICA. CONCERNING THE DIALOGUE IN GENEVA, I BELIEVE THAT TOMORROW THERE WILL BE A BRIEFING WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF DELEGATES FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN TOGETHER WITH THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL, WHO WILL ANNOUNCE THE MECHANISMS TO BE FOLLOWED IN THIS DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN. WHAT DO THE ARMED FORCES THINK ABOUT THE EIGHT BOMBS THAT WERE DETONATED YESTERDAY AND KILLED SIX SOLDIERS AND ONE CIVILIAN? WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS NOW, SINCE IT IS EVIDENT THAT EXPLOSIVES ARE AGAIN BEING USED AGAINST THE PEOPLE? WE, THE ARMED FORCES, FEEL THAT THESE EVENTS ARE CARRIED OUT BY THE TERRORISTS WITHIN THE FMLN WHO DO NOT BELIEVE DIALOGUE IS A MECHANISM FOR ACHIEIVING PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY. THESE INDIVIDUALS BELIEVE THAT VIOLENCE IS WHAT WILL LEAD THEM TO POWER.
DEV-MUC3-1208	SAN SALVADOR, 3 APR 90 -- THEY ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTEXT IN HISTORY. THEY HAD CLEARLY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WOULD NOT USE CAR BOMBS FROM NOW ON, BUT THEY USED ONE YESTERDAY NEVERTHELESS. THIS ACTION IS CONDEMNABLE FROM EVERY VIEWPOINT BECAUSE THE MEMBERS, RATHER THE ALUMNI, OF CETIPOL WHO WERE VICTIMS OF THIS ATTACK WERE UNARMED. THEY WERE SIMPLY DOING SOME PHYSICAL EXERCISES. IT IS ALSO DEPLORABLE THAT A BAKER WAS KILLED AND THAT A 12-YEAR-OLD YOUTH GOING TO SCHOOL WAS INJURED. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE EVENTS DO NOT CONTRIBUTE AT ALL TO THE CREATION OF THE APPROPRIATE ATMOSPHERE FOR SEEKING PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY. THIS AND MANY OTHER ACTS OF VIOLENCE WHICH HAVE RECENTLY OCCURRED CONTRADICT THE IMAGE THAT THE FMLN HAD PREVIOUSLY TRIED TO CREATE WITH ITS DECISION NOT TO CONTINUE SABOTAGING THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS SECTORS, AS WELL AS BUSINESSES. ALL THESE ACTIONS HAVE CONTINUED TO OCCUR. WE WANT TO BELIEVE THAT THESE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT BY TERRORISTS WHO ARE OUT OF THE FMLN LEADERS' CONTROL, BECAUSE, AS I SAID, THIS DOES NOT HELP AT ALL TO CREATE THE APPROPRIATE ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH TO SEEK PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY. COLONEL, REFERRING TO THE STATE OF SIEGE, WILL THE ARMED FORCES INSIST ON KEEPING IT OR NOT? THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY PRESIDENT COMMENTED ON THIS YESTERDAY. THIS IS A POLITICAL DECISION ANYWAY, AND IT IS ADOPTED BY THE ASSEMBLY -- SOMETIMES UPON REQUEST FROM... THE DEFENSE MINISTRY, YOU SAID. WE, AS AN ARMED CORPS AND WITH THE INTENTION OF HELPING CREATE THE APPROPRIATE ATMOSPHERE FOR PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY, WILL MAKE NO REQUEST TO EXTEND THE STATE OF EMERGENCY AND . DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE ARMED FORCES DECIDED THIS BECAUSE THE SITUATION OF VIOLENCE HAS DISAPPEARED? TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT CURRENT VIOLENT ACTIONS MIGHT COME FROM GROUPS OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF FMLN LEADERS, WE BELIEVE THAT THE COUNTRY'S SITUATION IS NOT NORMAL ENOUGH TO SAY THAT THERE IS NO VIOLENCE. HOWEVER, AS A CONTRIBUTION TO THAT PROPITIOUS ATMOSPHERE FOR THE DIALOGUE, I BELIEVE THAT IT IS ADVISABLE TO LIFT IT. I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS: WHAT IS THE ARMED FORCES' POSITION REGARDING ? AS FOR THE FIRST QUESTION, YOU ARE REFERRING TO STATEMENTS BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC. I BELIEVE THAT IN DUE TIME HE WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN THOSE STATEMENTS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE NEWSMAN DISTORTED HIS WORDS, BUT THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THE RESPECTIVE CLARIFICATION. I WILL, HOWEVER, STATE THAT ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED BY THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE NATIONAL POLICE AS TO WHETHER AT ANY TIME COLONEL BENAVIDES HAS LEFT THE HANDS OF THE NATIONAL POLICE, HE CLEARLY SAID THAT AT NO TIME HAS BENAVIDES DONE THIS. HE IS UNDER THE ORDERS OF THE 4TH PENAL JUDGE, AND AT NO TIME HAS THE 4TH PENAL JUDGE AUTHORIZED COL. BENAVIDES TO LEAVE THE CONFINES OF THE JAIL. THE PERSON WHO MADE THE ACCUSATIONS SHOULD PRESENT SOME EVIDENCE, A PHOTOGRAPH FOR EXAMPLE. OTHERWISE, THIS IS ALL MERE SPECULATION. THAT IS A VERY DELICATE CASE, AND SPECULATIONS CAST A NEGATIVE IMAGE ON THE ARMED FORCES AND THE COUNTRY ITSELF, AND EVEN ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN OUR COUNTRY. CONCERNING WHAT COULD HAPPEN IN THE TRIAL OF THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS, THE JUSTICE AUTHORITIES WILL DETERMINE WHAT WILL BE DONE. WE WILL RESPECT THAT DECISION.
DEV-MUC3-1209	PANAMA CITY , 4 APR 90 -- APPROXIMATELY 800 HEAVILY ARMED COLOMBIANS WITHOUT IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENTS WERE DISCOVERED CONDUCTING ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES AT THE BORDER BETWEEN PANAMA AND COLOMBIA, ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT AND JUSTICE MINISTER RICARDO ARIAS CALDERON. THERE ARE COLOMBIANS WITHOUT IDENTIFICATION AT THE BORDER. THERE ARE REPORTS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES. THERE WAS AN ATTACK IN PUERTO OBALDIA, IN WHICH A NATIONAL POLICEMAN WAS KILLED BY SOME COLOMBIAN NATIONALS. THIS IS BEING INVESTIGATED. THE COLOMBIAN NATIONALS HAVE NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BOTH INCIDENTS ARE LINKED. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AND THE GOVERNMENT AND JUSTICE MINISTRY WILL TAKE THE PROPER MEASURES AT THE PROPER TIME. DO YOU KNOW WHAT TYPE OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES THEY ARE CONDUCTING THERE NOW? THEY ARE PROBABLY CONDUCTING CONTRABAND- RELATED ACTIVITIES.
DEV-MUC3-1210	SAN SALVADOR, 30 MAR 90 -- INTERNATIONAL NEWS DISPATCHES HAVE REPORTED ON PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S REMARKS ABOUT WHY THE NEFARIOUS DEATH SQUADS HAVE APPEARED AND STILL THRIVE IN THE COUNTRY. CRISTIANI'S REMARKS, MADE IN CARACAS, HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF CONCERN FOR LOCAL AND FOREIGN OBSERVERS BECAUSE HE USES A STRANGE AND TWISTED LOGIC TO ANALYZE THE SALVADORAN SOCIAL REALITY. HE HAS SAID THAT THE DEATH SQUADS APPEARED IN RESPONSE TO THE FORMATION OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT . EVEN WORSE, HE SAID THAT THESE SQUADS WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN OUR COUNTRY AS LONG AS THE FMLN CONTINUES TO CARRY OUT POLITICAL AND MILITARY ACTIVITIES. CRISTIANI'S REMARKS HAVE CALLED THE ATTENTION OF UDN, WHICH CANNOT HELP BUT REJECT AND REFUTE ASSERTIONS DESIGNED TO CONFUSE THE LOCAL AND FOREIGN PUBLIC OPINION ON THE TRUE CAUSES OF VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY AND THE FMLN'S APPEARANCE AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE NATIONAL SCENARIO. FIRST, CRISTIANI'S ASSERTIONS REPRESENT MORAL SUPPORT FOR THE GROUPS AND BANDS OF ASSASSINS WHO, EMBEDDED IN AND PROTECTED BY THE STRUCTURES OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC POWER, HAVE ASSASSINATED WITH IMPUNITY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF LOWLY SALVADORANS. SECOND, CRISTIANI MISTAKES THE CASE FOR THE EFFECT BY SAYING THAT "VIOLENCE ENGENDERS VIOLENCE" AND THAT, THEREFORE, THERE WILL BE DEATH SQUADS AS LONG AS THERE ARE GUERRILLAS. THE TRUTH IS THAT THE DEATH SQUADS WERE ACTIVE EVEN BEFORE THE FMLN WAS ORGANIZED. HAS CRISTIANI PERHAPS FORGOTTEN THE ASSASSINATIONS PERPETRATED BY THE WHITE HAND , THE WHITE WAR UNION , AND OTHER GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN SPREADING TERROR FOR MANY YEARS? THIRD, VIOLENCE AND HOSTILITY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PRESENT IN EL SALVADOR SINCE THE SPANISH INVASION AND CONQUEST AND WORKERS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FAVORITE VICTIMS. WE HEREBY STATE THIS, FULLY COGNIZANT OF THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY. THE VIOLENCE OF THE PEOPLE HAS RESPONDED, AS A LAST DITCH RESORT, TO THE GENERALIZED VIOLENCE OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND STATE. LET US KEEP IN MIND OUR FOREBEARS' RESISTANCE TO THE SPANISH INVADERS; THE PEASANTS' AND INDIANS' PERSISTENT REBELLION AGAINST THE SOCIAL INJUSTICE OF COLONIAL TIMES; THE HEROIC ACTIONS AND THE PATRIOTIC ATTEMPTS THAT CULMINATED IN INDEPENDENCE; ANASTASIO AQUINO'S REBELLION; THE PEASANTS' AND INDIANS' RESISTANCE TO WORKING FOR THE NEW LANDOWNERS WHO DISPOSSESSED THEM OF THEIR COMMON LANDS DURING THE 1881 AGRARIAN REFORM; THE REBELLION OF WORKERS AND PEASANTS IN 1932; THE HISTORIC ACTION AGAINST DICTATOR MARTINEZ IN 1944; THE RANK AND FILE STRUGGLE AGAINST TYRANT LEMUS; THE PEOPLE'S STRUGGLE AGAINST THE ELECTORAL IMPOSITION IN THE 1970'S; AND THE UNYIELDING STRUGGLE OF AN ENTIRE PEOPLE FOR DEMOCRACY AND PEACE WITH SOCIAL JUSTICE, WHICH IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY.
DEV-MUC3-1211	CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- COMMANDER, THE FIGHTERS, EVEN SALVADORAN CITIZENS IN GENERAL, DO NOT UNDERSTAND CERTAIN ATTITUDES OF THE FMLN OR SOME OF THE COMMUNIQUES ISSUED BY THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND. WE SPENT EIGHT OR NINE YEARS FIGHTING THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE. WE REMEMBER THE ASSASSINATION OF HERBERT ANAYA SANABRIA. HOWEVER, WHEN DUARTE DIED, A COMMUNIQUE WAS ISSUED DECLARING A TRUCE SO THAT THE FUNERAL COULD TAKE PLACE PEACEFULLY. HOW SHOULD WE VIEW ALL OF THESE APPARENT CHANGES OF POSITION BY THE FMLN? AS FOR JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, WE HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT ADDITION TO BEING A POLITICAL FORCE, THE FMLN HAS HUMAN SENSITIVITY. WE THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR US TO TAKE THIS HUMANE ACTION BY DECLARING A TRUCE SO THAT MR. DUARTE COULD BE BURIED. WE ALSO HAVE TO MENTION THAT THE PDC AND ALL OF THE LEFTIST FORCES OF THE COUNTRY CAN CONTRIBUTE TOWARD THE DEPOLARIZATION OF SOCIETY. THE TRUCE WAS A GESTURE, IT WAS TO MAKE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SEE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO DEPOLARIZE SOCIETY AND THAT EACH OF US CAN MAKE A CONTRIBUTION. THAT IS WHY WE INSIST THAT ONE MUST NOT RETURN TO ONE'S ELECTORAL OR POLITICAL HEGEMONIC PLANS, BECAUSE THAT WOULD OBSTRUCT THE UNITY OF THE PEOPLE, WHICH IS NEEDED TO ISOLATE THE FASCISTS. COMMANDER, THERE WAS A DISCUSSION AT THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY WHEN DUARTE DIED BECAUSE THE PDC LEGISLATORS MOTIONED TO NAME HIM THE FATHER OF DEMOCRACY IN EL SALVADOR. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, WHO WAS IN POWER FOR ALMOST 10 YEARS, AND ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON? WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO POLITICIANS? WE BELIEVE THAT DUARTE WAS A FIGHTER FOR DEMOCRACY. HE HAD HIS OWN BELIEFS, HE HAD HIS OWN PERSONALITY, AND HE REALLY HAD CHARISMA; WE CANNOT DENY THAT. OF COURSE, WE CANNOT COMPARE HIM TO A CRIMINAL WHO IS BEING SOUGHT BY JUSTICE. I WOULD SAY THAT D'AUBUISSON IS A FUGITIVE FROM JUSTICE, WHO HAS SOUGHT SHELTER FROM HIS IMMUNITY AS A DEPUTY. HIS IMMUNITY AS A DEPUTY DOES NOT PRECLUDE HIS CRIMES. THERE IS NO COMPARISON BETWEEN DUARTE AND WHO IS WELL-KNOWN, BUT IS VIOLENT AND UNPOPULAR. TO END THE FIRST PART OF THE INTERVIEW, ARE YOU OPTIMISTIC ABOUT A POSSIBLE CONCERTED EFFORT BY POPULAR AND DEMOCRATIC FORCES IN THE COUNTRY OR DO YOU BELIEVE THAT EACH WILL GO HIS OWN WAY. ARE YOU OPTIMISTIC ABOUT A CONCERTED EFFORT? A CONCERTED EFFORT IN A POLITICAL STRUGGLE OF ALL THE FORCES IN THE COUNTRY SHOULD NOT ONLY BE SEEN AS A POSSIBILITY, BUT MUST BE SEEN AS A POLITICAL NECESSITY FOR THE UNITY OF ALL POPULAR AND NATIONAL SECTORS, BECAUSE THIS WOULD BE THE ONLY FORMULA TO REBUILD THE COUNTRY, TO REUNITE THE COUNTRY, AND TO RECONCILE THE COUNTRY. THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE WITH A CONCERTED POLITICAL EFFORT. I BELIEVE THERE WILL BE OPPORTUNITIES OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS FOR CONCERTED POLITICAL EFFORTS, WHICH WILL REALLY GIVE NEW HOPE TO THE LARGE MAJORITY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. WE MUST NOT FORGET ABOUT THE LARGE MAJORITY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE SPEAK ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN GROUPS OF THE COUNTRY AND NOT ON BEHALF OF THE MAJORITIES.
DEV-MUC3-1212	BOGOTA, 5 APR 90 -- AUTHORITIES REPORTED TODAY THAT LIBERAL SENATOR FEDERICO ESTRADA VELEZ, 54, ONE OF THE MAIN LEADERS OF THE RULING LIBERAL PARTY, WAS RELEASED TODAY IN MEDELLIN BY THE DRUG TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATION KNOWN AS THE EXTRADITABLES. SENATOR ESTRADA VELEZ WAS KIDNAPPED ON 27 MARCH NEAR HIS HOME BY THE EXTRADITABLES, THE MEDELLIN CARTEL'S ARMED WING.
DEV-MUC3-1213	SAN SALVADOR, 6 APR 90 -- FIVE SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AND FIVE WERE WOUNDED DURING A FIERCE GUERRILLA ATTACK THIS MORNING IN THE CITY OF SUCHITOTO, CUZCATLAN DEPARTMENT, IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY, MILITARY SPOKESPERSONS HAVE REPORTED. THE SOURCES INDICATED THAT THE REBEL ATTACK BY RIFLE FIRE BEGAN AT 0120 TODAY AND LASTED FOR FOUR HOURS. AFTER THIS, THE ARMY WAS IN CONTROL OF THE SITUATION. THE NUMBER OF REBEL CASUALTIES IS NOT KNOWN. THE FIGHTING BEGAN WHEN FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GUERRILLAS ATTACKED THE LAS GUARAS BRIDGE GUARD POST IN THE CITY OF SUCHITOTO, 44 KM FROM SAN SALVADOR. THE MILITARY SOURCES SAID THAT EARLY THIS MORNING THE ARMY WAS IN CONTROL OF THE SITUATION. HOWEVER, ARTILLERY UNITS ARE CONDUCTING A COMBING OPERATION IN AN EFFORT TO CAPTURE THE REBELS. GUERRILLAS ACTIVITIES HAVE INCREASED OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS AFTER THE FMLN SIGNED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT LAST WEDNESDAY IN GENEVA TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE TO RESOLVE THE 10-YEAR CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY. FMLN GUERRILLAS ATTACKED ARMED FORCES POSITIONS IN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE CAPITAL FOR MORE THAN A HALF HOUR YESTERDAY, RESULTING IN TWO REBELS BEING KILLED AND ONE WOUNDED, ACCORDING TO MILITARY REPORTS. THE FMLN HAS ALSO INTENSIFIED ITS SABOTAGE OF ELECTRICITY PYLONS, ABOVE ALL IN THE CAPITAL. THIS WEEK THE FMLN REBELS BROUGHT DOWN AT LEAST 20 ELECTRICITY PYLONS, CAUSING POWER OUTAGES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.
DEV-MUC3-1214	BOGOTA, 6 APR 90 -- THE CRIMINAL DRUG MAFIAS OPERATING IN COLOMBIA ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THEY WILL INCREASE THEIR TERRORIST ATTACKS ON "THE INDUSTRIAL AND POLITICAL OLIGARCHY" IN RESPONSE TO THE ALLEGED DISAPPEARANCE OF SEVERAL OF THEIR ACCOMPLICES. IN A COMMUNIQUE SENT BY TELEFAX TO SEVERAL NEWS MEDIA, "THE EXTRADITABLES," SPOKESMEN FOR THE MAFIAS, SAID THAT THEIR "WAR" WILL BE CARRIED OUT HENCEFORTH BECAUSE OF THE "DISAPPEARANCE, TORTURE, AND ASSASSINATION" OF SEVERAL DRUG TRAFFICKERS AT THE HANDS OF THE DIRECTORATE OF JUDICIAL POLICE AND INVESTIGATIONS . ACCORDING TO THE CRIMINALS, WHO AGAIN DESCRIBED THEMSELVES AS A "POLITICAL-MILITARY" ORGANIZATION, "THE PROBLEM OF THE EXTRADITION HAS BEEN RELEGATED TO A SECONDARY STATUS, SINCE OUR MAIN MOTIVE FOR THE WAR WILL BE THE TORTURE, ASSASSINATION, AND DISAPPEARANCE OF OUR COMRADES." A FEW DAYS AGO, IN A SIMILAR MESSAGE, THE CRIMINALS SAID THAT THEY WOULD PLACE 5-TON DYNAMITE BOMBS IN "NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE BOGOTA OLIGARCHY," IN REPRISAL FOR OFFENSIVE ACTIONS BY THE AUTHORITIES. YESTERDAY, A CAR-BOMB WITH 800 KG OF DYNAMITE WAS LEFT BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN AN EXCLUSIVE SECTOR OF THE CAPITAL. HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR A DEFECT IN THE DETONATOR, IT WOULD HAVE KILLED AT LEAST 5,000 PEOPLE. ACCORDING TO THE CRIMINALS, THE RESURGENCE OF TERRORIST ATTACKS IS DUE TO THE "DISAPPEARANCE" LATE LAST MONTH OF JOSE RETAVISTA GARZON, FREDDY LOPEZ OSPINA, AND BROTHERS OMAR AND GUILLERMO PEREA RIVERA, WHO REPORTEDLY WERE ARRESTED BY THE POLICE IN THE NORTHWESTERN TOWN OF ENVIGADO. HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO AN INVESTIGATION CARRIED OUT YESTERDAY BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, THESE PERSONS ARE NOT CONFINED IN ANY GARRISON OF THE ELITE FORCE, A POLICE ANTITERRORIST CORPS. "THE EXTRADITABLES" NOTED THAT "THE GOOD FAITH OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IN NO WAY SATISFIES OUR DEMANDS, BECAUSE THE MISSING COMPANIONS WERE TAKEN OUT OF THE SCHOOL AND EXECUTED BY ORDER OF DIJIN DIRECTOR OSCAR PELAEZ CARMONA, WHOM THEY ACCUSE OF "MASTERMINDING" SEVERAL MASSACRES. THE DRUG TRAFFICKING MAFIA ALSO SAID THAT THE KILLINGS OF POLICEMEN HAD BEEN SUSPENDED AND THAT THEY HAD NEVER PARTICIPATED IN "TORTURE," BUT, THEY ADDED, "WE WILL INTENSIFY OUR STRUGGLE AGAINST THE INDUSTRIAL AND POLITICAL OLIGARCHY, WHICH IS AN ACCOMPLICE TO THE ASSASSINATIONS." THE WAR AGAINST THE DRUG MAFIAS IN COLOMBIA, WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE EXPERIENCED A VIOLENT RESURGENCE, BEGAN LAST AUGUST AFTER MERCENARIES AT THE SERVICE OF THE CRIMINAL GROUPS ASSASSINATED IN THE SPACE OF A FEW HOURS A MAGISTRATE, A POLICE COLONEL, AND PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LUIS CARLOS GALAN.
DEV-MUC3-1215	CLANDESTINE, 6 APR 90 -- IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT ON 6 APRIL AT 0230, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GUERRILLAS ATTACKED POSITIONS THAT WERE BEING GUARDED BY UNITS OF THE LIGHTNING BATTALION OF MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 5 IN LAS GUARAS BRIDGE, LOCATED ON THE HIGHWAY THAT RUNS FROM SAN MARTIN TO SUCHITOTO, AND IN SAN PEDRO PERULAPAN, CUSCATLAN DEPARTMENT. THE FMLN GUERRILLAS ATTACKED FOUR POSITIONS WITH RIFLE FIRE AND ROCKET LAUNCHERS. AFTER 40 MINUTES OF ATTACKS, WE HAD TAKEN OVER THREE POSITIONS AND FORCED THE FOURTH ONE TO FLEE. IN THIS ATTACK, WE INFLICTED 13 CASUALTIES ON THE ENEMY. THE CASUALTIES WERE INFLICTED IN THE AREA OF SUCHITOTO, WHILE THE WAR MATERIEL WGS SEIZED IN SAN PEDRO PERULAPAN IN CUSCATLAN DEPARTMENT. WE INFLICTED 13 CASUALTIES IN THE AREA OF SUCHITOTO, INCLUDING A SUB-SERGEANT AND A WOUNDED CORPORAL. IN THE AREA OF THE LAS GUARAS BRIDGE, WE SEIZED FIVE M-16 RIFLES, ONE M-79 ROCKET LAUNCHER, 8,200 CARTRIDGES, 38 GRENADES FOR M-79 ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 11 KNAPSACKS, AND OTHER WAR MATERIEL. WE ALSO REPORT THAT COMRADE WILLIAM HEROICALLY FELL IN COMBAT, STRUGGLING TO TEAR DOWN THE FASCIST WALL AND URGING THE FATHERLAND TO UNITE FOR DEMOCRACY.
DEV-MUC3-1216	PARIS , 5 APRIL 90 -- COLOMBIAN LEADER VIRGILIO BARCO BRIEFED FRENCH PRESIDENT FRANCOIS MITTERRAND HERE WEDNESDAY ON THE EFFORTS MADE BY BOGOTA TO FIGHT THE COUNTRY'S POWERFUL COCAINE TRAFFICKERS. MR. BARCO TOLD REPORTERS AFTER THE MEETING AT THE ELYSEE PALACE THAT THE FRENCH LEADER, WHO VISITED BOGOTA IN OCTOBER 1989, HAD SAID ONCE AGAIN THAT HE WAS "VERY INTERESTED" IN THE DRUG PROBLEM. FRENCH SOURCES SAID THE COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT HAD INFORMED MR. MITTERRAND OF THE EFFORTS TAKEN BY HIS GOVERNMENT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND DESCRIBED THEM AS ENCOURAGING. MR. BARCO WAS QUOTED AS SAYING THAT HE WAS PARTICULARLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT CONTROLLING IMPORTS OF CHEMICALS NEEDED BY TRAFFICKERS TO MAKE COCAINE. ASKED ABOUT BRINGING MEMBERS OF A POWERFUL GROUP OF DRUG BARONS KNOWN AS THE "THE EXTRADITABLES" TO TRIAL, MR. BARCO SAID IT WOULD "DEPEND ON EACH INDIVIDUAL CASE." THE TWO PRESIDENTS ALSO DISCUSSED THE COFFEE MARKET, FRENCH SOURCES SAID. COFFEE IS COLOMBIA'S MAIN LEGAL CASH CROP, AND PRICES HAVE PLUNGED IN THE PAST YEAR WITH THE COLLAPSE OF A MARKET AGREEMENT BETWEEN PRODUCER AND CONSUMER COUNTRIES. MR. BARCO VISITED STRASBOURG, EASTERN FRANCE, EARLIER WEDNESDAY WHERE HE ADDRESSED THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY PARLIAMENT AND APPEALED FOR EASIER ACCESS TO EUROPEAN MARKETS FOR COLOMBIAN GOODS. IN AN ADDRESS TO THE BODY, MR. BARCO ASKED THE EEC TO REDUCE CUSTOMS DUTIES ON COFFEE. MR. BARCO, WHO HANDED OUT PACKETS OF COLOMBIAN COFFEE TO EURO-MPS , ALSO ASKED THE COMMUNITY TO LIFT TARIFFS ON FLOWERS, AND QUOTAS ON THE QUANTITY OF BANANAS EXPORTED TO THE 12 EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY NATIONS. EARLY IN THE SPEECH, ECOLOGIST MPS HELD UP SIGNS LISTING VICTIMS OF ALLEGED COLOMBIAN ARMY "ASSASSINATIONS." THE PRESIDENT OF PARLIAMENT, SPAIN'S ENRIQUE BARON CRESPO, SPOKE OF "CONCERN IN THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT OVER THE MANY INSTANCES OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE WHICH HAVE CAUSED DEATHS IN COLOMBIA." MR. BARCO ADMITTED "CERTAIN GROUPS HAVE MANAGED TO CONTAMINATE SOME ELEMENTS OF THE STATE FORCES" BUT SAID "THE GOVERNMENT HAD SEPARATED ITSELF FROM SUSPECT OFFICIALS," OR THAT THEY WERE AT LEAST UNDER INVESTIGATION. MR. BARCO IS TO VISIT BELGIUM AND BRITAIN FOLLOWING HIS STAY HERE.
DEV-MUC3-1217	LIMA, 7 APR 90 -- THE "SHINING PATH" TERRORIST ORGANIZATION IS KEEPING THREE PERUVIAN CITIES UNDER PRESSURE WITH THREE "ARMED STRIKES"-- STRIKES ENFORCED BY DEATH THREATS--THAT BEGAN TODAY IN AN EFFORT TO FORCE A BOYCOTT OF TOMORROW'S GENERAL ELECTIONS. AYACUCHO, THE CAPITAL OF THE SOUTHERN DEPARTMENT OF AYACUCHO, IS UNDER A STATE OF MILITARY EMERGENCY. THERE IS NEITHER ELECTRICITY NOR WATER IN THE CITY, AND EVERY ACTIVITY HAS BEEN SUSPENDED AS A RESULT OF THE THREE-DAY "ARMED STRIKE" CALLED AS OF TODAY. THERE IS NO TRANSPORTATION EITHER, STORES ARE CLOSED, AND THE STREEETS ARE PATROLLED BY THE ARMY AND THE MILITARY POLICE. ROADS LINKING AYACUCHO WITH THE DEPARTMENTAL PROVINCES OF CANGALLADO AND LA MAR WERE BLOCKED BY SHINING PATH TERRORISTS WITH STONES AND TREE TRUNKS. THE 55-KM ROAD LINKING AYACUCHO WITH THE CITY OF HUANTA IS GUARDED BY 4,000 MEMBERS OF THE "PEASANT PATROLS," WHICH ARE OPPOSED TO THE "SHINING PATH." THERE ARE A FEW VANS ON THE ROAD, UNDER MILITARY SURVEILLANCE. "SHINING PATH" TERRORISTS HAVE DESTROYED A SUSPENSION BRIDGE LINKING AYACUCHO WITH THE PROVINCE OF JULCAMARCA, WHICH WAS THUS FORCED INTO ISOLATION. CANDIDATES FOR DEPUTY FROM AYACUCHO DEPARTMENT FOR THE RULING APRA , THE VARGAS LLOSA-LED DEMOCRATIC FRONT , AND THE UNITED LEFT, AS WELL AS FOREIGN AND LOCAL JOURNALISTS WHO WILL COVERING THE ELECTION IN THAT AREA ARE ALL LODGED IN A HOTEL IN AYACUCHO. "SHINING PATH" HAS THREATENED TO BLOW UP THE HOTEL, WHICH IS HEAVILY GUARDED BY THE POLICE. MEANWHILE, THE PEOPLE OF AYACUCHO ARE CHECKING THE VOTER LISTS TO FIND OUT WHERE EACH VOTER WILL HAVE TO CAST HIS VOTE TOMORROW. THE SHINING PATH ALSO CALLED FOR AN "ARMED STRIKE" FROM TODAY UNTIL MONDAY IN HUARAZ, CAPITAL OF THE ANCASH DEPARTMENT, BORDERING LIMA DEPARTMENT TO THE NORTH. THE CITY WAS PARALYZED AND IN THE DARK FOLLOWING THE DESTRUCTION OF A HIGH-TENSION PYLON SIX KM FROM THE CITY. AS THE RESULT OF THAT ATTACK, FIVE PROVINCES OF ANCASH WERE LEFT WITHOUT ELECTRICITY. THE SHINING PATH TERRORISTS HURLED EXPLOSIVES AT A MARKET IN HUARAZ, INJURING 15 PEOPLE. THE HUARAZ-LIMA ROAD WAS BLOCKED FOR 15 HOURS WHEN SHINING PATH GUERRILLAS SET TWO TRUCKS LOADED WITH MINERALS ON FIRE. ANCASH DEPARTMENT LIES OUTSIDE THE AREA UNDER THE STATE OF EMERGENCY THAT ENCOMPASSES HALF OF PERU, INCLUDING THE METROPOLITAN LIMA AREA. HUANCAYO, 415 KM SOUTHEAST OF LIMA, IS COMPLETELY PARALYZED BY THE "ARMED STRIKE" IMPOSED BY THE SHINING PATH. ALL ACTIVITIES-- BANKS, COMMERCE, MARKETS, PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION--HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED. SINCE FRIDAY THERE HAVE BEEN EIGHT BOMBINGS OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FACILITIES. A CAR WAS DESTROYED BY A BOMB. THE CITY'S ELECTRICITY SUPPLY HAS BEEN CUT, FOLLOWING THE DESTRUCTION OF THREE HIGH-TENSION PYLONS. ALSO AFFECTED WAS THE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY IN THE ENTIRE MANTARO RIVER VALLEY, WHERE THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST HYDROELECTRIC PLANT IS LOCATED. THIS PLANT SUPPLIES 80 PERCENT OF PERU'S ELECTRICITY. SINCE LAST YEAR, SHINING PATH TERRORISTS HAVE BEEN EXTENDING THEIR ACTIVITIES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF AYACUCHO TO THE STRATEGIC DEPARTMENT OF JUNIN, BORDERING THE DEPARTMENT OF LIMA. JUNIN PROVIDES MOST OF LIMA'S FOOD.

DEV-MUC3-1222	SAN SALVADOR, 10 APR 90 -- COLONEL INOCENTE MONTANO, SALVADORAN DEPUTY SECURITY MINISTER, TODAY ADMITTED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE SEIZURE OF AN ARMS SHIPMENT IN HONDURAS ON 7 APRIL MAY MEAN THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS ARE PLANNING A NEW MILITARY OFFENSIVE. ACCORDING TO MONTANO, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT MAY LAUNCH THE OFFENSIVE BEFORE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT- ELECT VIOLETA CHAMORRO ASSUMES OFFICE ON 25 APRIL. "WE MUST NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE SALVADORAN TERRORISTS MIGHT PROMOTE TERRORIST ACTIONS BEFORE THE SANDINISTS RELINQUISH POWER IN ORDER TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF ANTAGONISM AGAINST THE NEW GOVERNMENT IN MANAGUA AND DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY HAVE STRENGTH," THE MILITARY OFFICER SAID. ACCORDING TO THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, THE ARMS SHIPMENT SEIZED BY HONDURAN AUTHORITIES ON SATURDAY CONSISTS OF 24 AK-47 RIFLES, 24 HANDLES AND 76 CLIPS FOR THOSE WEAPONS, 80 ROLLS OF "SLOW FUSE" WEIGHING OVER 2 KG EACH, AND A "LARGE QUANTITY OF MATERIALS TO MANUFACTURE EXPLOSIVES." THE MILITARY MATERIAL WAS BEING CARRIED IN A TRUCK BY SALVADORANS VICTOR EMILIO DUBON AND FELICIANO GARCIA, WHO "WERE PART OF LOGISTICS UNIT," OF THE FMLN, ACCORDING TO A PRESS COMMUNIQUE RELEASED BY THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE TODAY. COPREFA ADDED THAT THIS FMLN "LOGISTICS UNIT" WAS IN CHARGE OF "THE ARMS SMUGGLING TO EL SALVADOR." ON 8 APRIL, ANOTHER "LARGE QUANTIITY OF MEDICINE AND SURGICAL SUPPLIES" WAS SEIZED IN THE HONDURAN DEPARTMENT OF COPAN, WHERE THE ARMS CARGO HAD BEEN DISCOVERED THE DAY BEFORE, COPREFA REPORTED. "THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES AGAIN CALL ON CITIZENS TO REPORT ALL SORTS OF SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITIES THAT MAY BE CARRIED OUT IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THUS AVERT POSSIBLE TERRORIST ACTIONS BY THE FMLN," COPREFA SAID IN A COMMNIQUE RELEASED TONIGHT. THE CHARGES REGARDING THE SEIZURE OF WEAPONS AND MEDICINE HAVE BEEN RAISED AT A TIME WHEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN ARE PREPARING TO RESUME THE PROCESS OF DIALOGUE UNDER UN SPONSORSHIP, PROBABLY EARLY NEXT MONTH. THE DEPUTY SECURITY MINISTER NOTED THAT THE DIALOGUE PROCESS IS "ONGOING" BUT ADDED THAT SITUATIONS LIKE THIS "HINDER THE NEGOTIATIONS." MONTANO MADE THE STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS DURING THE FUNERAL OF OTTO SORTO MILLA, SON-IN-LAW OF THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE CHIEF WHO DIED YESTERDAY, 17 DAYS AFTER AN ATTACK IN WHICH HE WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED AND FOR WHICH THE GUERRILLAS CLAIMED CREDIT.
DEV-MUC3-1223	BOGOTA, 13 APR 90 -- A SLIGHT TREMOR MEASURING THREE ON THE INTERNATIONAL SCALE OF ONE TO 12 ROCKED SOUTHWEST COLOMBIA AT 1027 LOCAL WITHOUT CAUSING ANY DAMAGE OR VICTIMS, THE OCCIDENTE OBSERVATORY IN THE CITY OF CALI, 500 KM FROM BOGOTA, HAS REPORTED. THE QUAKE WAS HARDLY FELT, BUT FIRST AID ORGANIZATIONS IN CALI REPORTED THAT THEY HAD RECEIVED TELEPHONE CALLS FROM PEOPLE WHO DID FEEL IT AND WHO VOICED THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THE RISKS THAT COULD BE RUN IN CHURCHES, WHICH ARE FILLED WITH PARISHIONERS ATTENDING GOOD FRIDAY MASSES. THE QUAKE WAS ALSO SLIGHTLY FELT IN TOWNS LIKE TULUA, BUGA, BUENAVVENTURA, PASTO, PEREIRA, AND POPAYAN, A CITY WHICH WAS DESTROYED BY AN EARTHQUAKE ON MAUNDY THURSDAY IN 1983 KILLING APPROXIMATELY 200 PEOPLE AND INJURING OVER 500.
DEV-MUC3-1224	SAN SALVADOR, 14 APR 90 -- SALVADORAN MILITARY SPOKESMEN REVEALED TODAY THAT A REBEL CELL, IN WHICH TWO HONDURAN WOMEN ARE MEMBERS, CLANDESTINELY INTRODUCED INTO THE COUNTRY, THROUGH HONDURAS, SEVERAL PISTOLS, THOUSANDS OF ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION, SOVIET RIFLES, MEDICINE, AND EXPLOSIVES FOR THE GUERRILLAS. IN THE FIRST REPORT, THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE SAID DEFINITIVELY THAT "THE WEAPONS CAME FROM NICARAGUA, THROUGH HONDURAS, DESTINED FOR TERRORISTS IN EL SALVADOR." THE SECOND MILITARY REPORT ON THIS MATTER SAID THAT "THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION RESULTS HAVE NOW MADE STEPPED-UP GUN-RUNNING FROM THAT COUNTRY A SHORT TERM POSSIBILITY, NOT ONLY FOR OUR COUNTRY BUT FOR OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN REGION. IN A COMMUNIQUE, THE SALVADORAN DEFENSE MINISTRY SAID THAT THE ARMS AND MEDICINE WERE INTRODUCED INTO EL SALVADOR IN 19 TRIPS OVER A YEAR'S TIME FROM SAN PEDRO SULA . THE MILITARY SOURCE SAID THAT THE REBEL CELL, CONSISTING OF SALVADORANS TITO OLIVIO DUBON AND FELICIANO GARCIA SORTO AND HONDURAN WOMEN ADILIA AND AMINTA DUBON RAMIREZ, "HAD THE MISSION" OF SECRETLY TRANSPORTING ARMS AND MEDICINE INTO THE COUNTRY. ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY COMMUNIQUE, 155 AK-47 RIFLES, 45 PISTOLS, 60,000 ROUNDS FOR VARIOUS CALIBER RIFLES, 126 GRENADES FOR RPG-7'S, MEDICINE, AND MATERIALS FOR MAKING EXPLOSIVES WERE CLANDESTINELY BROUGHT INTO EL SALVADOR BETWEEN APRIL 1989 AND 7 APRIL 1990. TITO DUBON AND GARCIA SORTO WERE ARRESTED ON 7 APRIL IN COLOLACA MUNICIPALITY, IN HONDURAS' LEMPIRA DEPARTMENT, WHILE TRYING TO INTRODUCE THE ARMS SHIPMENT INTO THE COUNTRY INSIDE THE SECRET COMPARTMENTS OF A TRUCK. ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY INFORMATION, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT CELL USED TWO DIFFERENT ROUTES FOR THE TRIPS, DEPARTING FROM THE CITY OF SAN PEDRO SULA. "ON ROUTE 1, 12 TRIPS WERE MADE BETWEEN JUNE 1989 AND 7 APRIL 1990. ROUTE 2 WAS USED FOR THREE TRIPS BETWEEN APRIL AND MAY 1989 TO A PLACE LOCATED IN MERCEDES, OCOTEPEQUE DEPARTMENT, WHERE THE FMLN TERRORISTS PICKED UP THE WEAPONS AND OTHER WAR MATERIEL," THE DEFENSE MINISTRY REPORTED. THE REPORT DOES NOT SPECIFY THE ROUTE USED FOR THE REMAINING FOUR TRIPS, IN WHICH THE SAME FOUR PEOPLE TOOK PART. THE TWO HONDURAN WOMEN, NOW UNDER DETENTION, GAVE THE SALVADORANS FALSE DOCUMENTATION TO PASS AS HONDURANS, ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY INVESTIGATIONS.
DEV-MUC3-1225	HAVANA , 5 APR 90 -- VARIOUS INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS HAVE MADE POSSIBLE THE MEETING IN OSLO, NORWAY'S CAPITAL. AT THE END OF MARCH, A GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY ARMY DELEGATION, REPRESENTING ITS GENERAL COMMAND, MET WITH A NATIONAL RECONCILIATION COMMISSION DELEGATION, ACCREDITED TO SUPPORT THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMY TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE VERY GRAVE CRISIS THAT IS AFFECTING THE COUNTRY IN GENERAL. IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THE POLITICAL WILL AND BROAD INITIATIVE REPEATEDLY DISPLAYED BY THE URNG GENERAL COMMAND, WHICH SEEKS A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICT WITH THEIR PARTICIPATION, HAS RECEIVED WIDESPREAD WELCOME AMONG THE POPULATION AND HAS CAUSED GREAT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL REPERCUSSIONS RESULTING IN THE APPROVAL AND SUPPORT OF A BROAD AND REPRESENTATIVE SEGMENT OF GUATEMALAN POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SECTORS. AS MAY BE RECALLED, IT HAS BEEN THE MILITARY AND GOVERNMENT WHO HAVE OBSTINATELY REFUSED TO TALK TO THE GUATEMALAN ARMED INSURGENTS. THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE WEAKNESSES, ISOLATION, AND CONTRADICTIONS WITHIN THE ARMY AND THE RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THE ARMY'S SECTOR MOST RELUCTANT TO TALK WITH THE GUERRILLAS IS BENT ON RESOLVING GUATEMALA'S ARMED CONFLICT BY WAY OF THE MILITARY, NOTWITHSTANDING THAT IT CONTRADICTORILY REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR EXISTENCE. IT IS THIS SECTOR THAT THE TROOPS AND SOME OFFICERS -- NOT PRECISELY THE SELF-NAMED MOUNTAIN OFFICERS -- BLAME FOR THE HARD SETBACKS AND SEVERE BLOWS INFLICTED BY THE GUERRILLA FORCES, THE FAILURE OF THE COUNTERINSURGENCY STRATEGY, AND THE ARMY BEING BOGGED DOWN. FOR THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, THE SITUATION IS SOMETHING LIKE AN ALLEY, THE WAY OUT OF WHICH COULD BE SEEN IF DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL HECTOR GRAMAJO OPTED TO FOLLOW AND RESPECT THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF THE OSLO AGREEMENTS. IN THE CASE OF GUATEMALA, HOWEVER, IT IS NOT JUST SIMPLY ENDING AN UNDECLARED WAR THAT HAS LASTED NEARLY 30 YEARS. IN THE OPINION OF THE GUATEMALAN REVOLUTIONARIES, THE HELP OF ALL WHO FAVOR DEMOCRACY AND PEACE IS NEEDED TO LAY DOWN THE BASIS FOR A GREAT NATIONAL ACCORD THAT WILL ENSURE FOR GUATEMALA A SERIOUS PROCESS OF DIALOGUE AND TALKS SO AS TO RESOLVE THE HISTORIC AND ROOT STRUCTURAL CAUSES THAT HAVE GENERATED THE DOMESTIC ARMED CONFLICT, WHICH STILL REMAINS INTACT. THESE JUSTIFY AND GIVE VALIDITY TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROJECT, AND THE PATRIOTIC AND POPULAR STRUGGLE BY THE ARMED GUATEMALAN REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT. COMPLIANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BASIC AGREEMENT TO SEEK PEACE THROUGH POLITICAL MEANS, SIGNED IN THE NORWEGIAN CAPITAL ON 30 APRIL, DEPENDS THEN ON THE WILL AND POLITICAL ATTITUDE OF THE SIDES IN THE CONFLICT. THE GUATEMALAN REVOLUTIONARIES ARE PRECISELY THE ONES WHO HAVE SHOWN THE MOST WILLINGNESS AND WILL, AND WHO HAVE MADE THE MOST EFFORTS IN FAVOR OF PEACE IN GUATEMALA. THEIR WIDESPREAD POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES AND THEIR MEANINGFUL ADVANCES IN THE BATTLEFIELD PERMIT THE INSURGENTS TO SIT DOWN AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE WITH ENOUGH RESOURCES AND CONDITIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE OSLO AGREEMENTS ARE RESPECTED AND COMPLIED WITH; THAT GUATEMALA ENTERS INTO A TRUE PROCESS OF DEMOCRACY IN ITS INSTITUTIONS AND STRUCTURES, WITH BROAD NATIONAL SUPPORT AND INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY; AND THAT PEACE IS REESTABLISHED -- AN HONORABLE PEACE WITH DIGNITY THAT GUARANTEES SOCIAL JUSTICE AND INDEPENDENCE, PROGRESS, AND WELLBEING.
DEV-MUC3-1226	SANTIAGO, 7 APR 90 -- THROUGH HIS SPOKESMAN, U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH HAS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WILL VISIT CHILE IN SEPTEMBER. THIS VERY IMPORTANT POLITICAL EVENT DEMONSTRATES THE EXTENT OF THE CHANGE THAT HAS OCCURRED IN THE COUNTRY SINCE THE 14 DECEMBER 1989 ELECTIONS. THE ISOLATION HAS BEEN BROKEN AFTER A 16-YEAR PERIOD, AND IMPORTANT WORLD PERSONALITIES ARE BEGINNING TO VISIT US. ITALY HAS CONSIDERED CHILE TO BE ONE OF ITS FIRST PRIORITIES FOR ECONOMIC AID AND TRADE. RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR COUNTRY AND BULGARIA WERE RESUMED ON FRIDAY AFTER 16 YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP. PREVIOUSLY, OTHER SOCIALIST COUNTRIES TOOK THE SAME PATH, AND IT WAS ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO THAT THE MEXICAN PRESIDENT VISITED OUR CAPITAL TO CONFIRM THAT LINKS HAD BEEN RESUMED BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS. IN GENERAL PINOCHET'S OPINION, CHILE WAS AT WAR FOR THE 16 YEARS OF THE DICTATORSHIP. CURIOUSLY, THE ALLEGED ALLIED CAMP, THE WESTERN COUNTRIES THROUGH THEIR CHIEFS OF STATE, REFUSED TO TALK WITH HIM OR EXTEND HIM INVITATIONS. FURTHERMORE, IT WAS CONSIDERED DISGRACEFUL TO HAVE ANY LINKS WITH THE REIGNING REGIME THAT HAD VIOLATED EVERY TYPE OF HUMAN RIGHT ACCORDING TO 16 SENTENCES HANDED DOWN BY THE UNITED NATIONS. FOR THE UNITED STATES, RELATIONS WITH CHILE WERE ANNOYING AND THAT COUNTRY MADE IT KNOWN. THE DICTATORSHIP'S COMMANDOS TRAVELLED TO WASHINGTON TO KILL ORLANDO LETELIER. FOR THIS OPERATION THEY VIOLATED BORDERS AND LAWS WITH FALSE PASSPORTS TO CONDUCT THIS TERRORIST ACT THAT IS STILL CONSIDERED A BLACK MARK AGAINST CHILEAN JUSTICE. NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF CHILEAN-U.S. RELATIONS HAVE THINGS BEEN SO LOW AS DURING THE PAST 16 YEARS. ONLY IN LIGHT OF THIS BACKGROUND DATA CAN THE IMPORTANCE OF GEORGE BUSH'S VISIT BE EVALUATED. ALL THIS MARKS THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA WITH THE RE-INSTATEMENT OF OUR NATION IN THE PLACE THAT IT HAS ALWAYS HISTORICALLY OCCUPIED, THE RECOVERY OF OUR INFLUENCE, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS COUNTRY'S FUTURE COMMITMENTS. BUSH'S VISIT IS THE MOST VISIBLE DEMONSTRATION THAT "THE WARS" HAVE ENDED AND THAT INTERNATIONAL POLICIES ARE TODAY BUILT ON THE BASIS OF UNDERSTANDING AND COOPERATION.
DEV-MUC3-1227	PORT-AU-PRINCE , 19 APR 90 -- A DELEGATION FROM LA FANMI SE LA VI IS GOING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON STREET URCHINS BEING HELD 23-30 APRIL IN BUENOS AIRES, CAPITAL OF ARGENTINA. THE REVEREND FATHER JEAN BERTRAND ARISTIDE, WHO LEADS THIS LITTLE SOCIETY, WILL LEAVE HAITI ON 20 APRIL. HE WILL BE HEADING THE HAITIAN DELEGATION TO THIS CONFERENCE. FATHER ARISTIDE SAID HE IS LEAVING WITH MUCH CHAGRIN IN HIS HEART BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE THE UNDERCOVER DETECTIVES STILL ARMED BUT THE JUDICIARY HAS AS YET TO SHOW THAT CHANGE IS BLOWING OVER THE COUNTRY. FATHER ARISTIDE POINTED THE FINGER AT MRS. ERTHA PASCAL TROUILLOT, WHO MUST SHOULDER HER RESPONSIBILITY BEFORE THE ENTIRE WORLD, WHICH THINKS THE HAITIAN ARMY IS UNDER THE ORDERS OF THE NATION'S PRESIDENT, LIKE THE HEAD OF THE ARMY DECLARED ON 13 MARCH 1990. FATHER ARISTIDE FEELS ONE CANNOT COUNT ON THE HAITIAN ARMY TO PROVIDE SECURITY DURING THE ELECTIONS. FATHER ARISTIDE SAYS THAT, EVEN THOUGH A PART OF THE ARMY IS HONEST, THE TREND TODAY DICTATES ORGANIZED VIGILANCE BRIGADES IN ADDITION TO THE HONEST PART OF THE ARMY, IF WE DO NOT WANT A REPEAT OF 29 NOVEMBER 1987. FATHER ARISTIDE SAYS YES TO ELECTIONS BUT FIRST, JUSTICE. IF NOT, THE OAS AND THE UNITED NATIONS CAN GO AHEAD AND COME TO HAITI, BUT IT WILL BE LIKE WASHING ONE'S HANDS AND PATTING THEM ON THE DUSTY GROUND TO DRY THEM. REGARDING THE WAY THE POPULATION IS PROVIDING ITS OWN JUSTICE BY BURNING PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, FATHER ARISTIDE SAID THAT THE POPULATION ACTS THIS WAY BECAUSE THE JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES DO NOT DO THEIR DUTY; AND THAT IF THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE DOES NOT DECIDE TO HURRY UP, THEY MIGHT AS WELL SHUT IT DOWN AND RE-OPEN IT WITH BRAND NEW PEOPLE. REGARDING THE RUMORS CIRCULATING TO THE EFFECT THAT FATHER ARISTIDE IS PLANNING TO RUN IN THE FUTURE ELECTIONS IN HAITI, FATHER ARISTIDE DECLARED: ARISTIDE HAS NEVER BEEN POWER-MAD. NOR HAS HE EVER HANKERED TO BE PRESIDENT. FATHER ARISTIDE SAID, FURTHER, AND WE QUOTE: I HAVE CHOSEN TO REMAIN AT THE SIDE OF THE MASSES. I WILL DO WHAT THE MASSES ASK ME TO DO, AS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE. LAST, FATHER ARISTIDE ASKED THE HONEST MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES TO GO OVER AND STAND AT THE SIDE OF THE MASSES. BY SO DOING, THEY WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS PEOPLE WHO WORKED TO SET HAITI ON THE ROAD TO DEMOCRACY. THUS, FATHER ARISTIDE HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE THIS MORNING, TO ANNOUNCE THAT HE WAS GOING ON A TRIP TO REPRESENT LA FANMI SE LA VI AT THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON STREET URCHINS THAT IS BEING HELD IN ARGENTINA.
DEV-MUC3-1228	BUENOS AIRES, 21 APR 90 -- DEFENSE MINISTER HUMBERTO ROMERO SAID TODAY THAT ARGENTINA HAS "SUSPENDED AND FROZEN" THE "CONDOR" MISSILE PROJECT. HE ALSO DENIED INTERNATIONAL PRESS REPORTS THAT THE MISSILE WAS BEING BUILT IN SECRET WITH IRAQ FOR POTENTIAL USE AGAINST ISRAEL. DURING A MEETING WITH REPORTERS THIS AFTERNOON, ROMERO SAID: "THE PROJECT WAS SUSPENDED BECAUSE OF A POLITICAL DECISION, AND ALSO BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE FUNDS TO FINANCE THIS TECHNICAL PROJECT." THIS IS HOW THE MINISTER IMPLICITLY ALLUDED TO THE REPEATED PRESS REPORTS FROM EUROPE, THE UNITED STATES, AND THE MIDDLE EAST ABOUT ARGENTINE PARTICIPATION IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF ONE OF THE STAGES OF THE IRAQI MISSILE SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT SPECIFICALLY MENTION IRAQ, ISRAEL, OR THE REPORT ON THE MISSILE, ROMERO SAID: "WE WANT TO PUT THIS TO REST IN THE FACE OF PUBLICATIONS THAT APPEAR IN THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS EVERY SO OFTEN." HE ADDED: "WE ALWAYS SAID THE PROJECT NEVER REPRESENTED ANY RISK OR DANGER FOR ANYONE, BUT AT ANY RATE THE PROJECT WAS SUSPENDED, IT IS FROZEN." THIS WEEK IRAQI PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSSEIN SAID HIS COUNTRY CAN WAGE A TOTAL WAR AGAINST ISRAEL THROUGH THE USE OF MEDIUM-RANGE STRATEGIC MISSILES THAT CAN REPORTEDLY CARRY CHEMICAL WEAPONS. HUSSEIN ALSO SAID ANY ISRAELI EFFORT TO BOMB THE IRAQI MISSILE MANAUFACTURING PLANTS WOULD BE FUTILE BECAUSE "OUR MISSILES ARE MADE IN PARTS IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE WORLD." ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN MENTIONED AS THE MANUFACTURER, IN COOPERATION WITH EGYPT AND IRAQ, OF MEDIUM-RANGE -- ABOUT 800 KM -- BALLISTIC MISSILES. EACH TIME ARGENTINA HAS CATEGORICALLY DENIED THIS. THE ARGENTINE AIR FORCE SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED THE "CONDOR I" AND "CONDOR II" PROJECTS. IT HAS BEEN ASSURED THAT THESE ARE FOR PUTTING A DOMESTIC SATELLITE IN ORBIT. THE LAST MISSILE TEST WAS MADE JULY L989 AT THE CHAMICAL AIRSPACE BASE, LA RIOJA PROVINCE, WHERE A STAGE OF THE "CONDOR" MISSILE TRAVELLED MORE THAT 160 KM.
DEV-MUC3-1229	BOGOTA, 23 APR 90 -- INVESTIGATIONS UNDER WAY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN FRUITLESS REGARDING THE ALLEGED PRESENCE OF SPANISH, BRITISH, ISRAELI, OR ITALIAN TERRORISTS IN COLOMBIA, FOLLOWING THE FOILED ATTACK ON SEVEN GENERALS, EIGHT COLONELS, AND OTHER TOP COMMANDERS OF THE ARMY AND NATIONAL POLICE IN MEDELLIN. MEANWHILE, GENERAL MIGUEL ALFREDO MAZA MARQUEZ, DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY, IDENTIFIED EUGENIO EXENDESTE, AN IDEOLOGIST OF THE BASQUE FATHERLAND AND LIBERTY SEPARATIST ORGANIZATION, AS THE LINK BETWEEN THE MEDELLIN CARTEL AND THE SPANISH TERRORISTS. POLICE OPERATIONS DIRECTOR GENERAL OCTAVIO VARGAS SILVA SAID THAT ALL SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS ARE ON MAXIMUM ALERT. HE NOTED THAT THE SECRET ORGANIZATIONS HAVE COMPOSITE SKETCHES OF THE SUSPECTED ETA MEMBERS AND THE TWO COLOMBIANS WHO COORDINATED ALL THE STEPS TO CARRY OUT THE ATTACK THAT WAS INTENDED TO KILL MANY CIVILIANS AS A RESULT OF A ROCKET ATTACK ON A GASOLINE TRUCK THAT CARRIED 3,000 GALLONS OF FLIGHT FUEL.
DEV-MUC3-1230	MADRID , 23 APR 90 -- PRIME MINISTER FELIPE GONZALEZ BELIEVES THAT THE LATEST BASQUE FATHERLAND LIBERTY ATTACKS SIGNIFY THE RECOGNITION OF AN EXTRAORDINARY WEAKNESS OF THE TERRORISTS. PRIME MINISTER GONZALEZ SAID THAT THIS MORNING'S ATTACK IN MADRID AND LAST THURSDAY'S IN SEVILLE WERE REPUGNANT AND COMPARED THE TERRORISTS TO THE COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS. FELIPE GONZALEZ MADE THESE STATEMENTS AT THE END OF A MEETING WITH THE BOLIVAN PRESIDENT, JAIME PAZ ZAMORA.
DEV-MUC3-1231	SAN SALVADOR, 25 APR 90 -- 1. THE ATTITUDE OF CERTAIN BAD ARMED FORCES MEMBERS SHOULD NOT BE USED TO CREATE A NEGATIVE IMAGE OF THE ARMED FORCES IN GENERAL. QUITE THE CONTRARY, IT IS APPROPRIATE TO PURGE THE RANKS AND GET RID OF THOSE BAD MEMBERS, SO THAT THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO HARM THE REMAINING MEMBERS. 2. THIS PUBLIC STATEMENT ABOUT THE NEED FOR A PURGE IS SIMPLY THE REPLY TO A HISTORICAL REQUIREMENT, BECAUSE WHOEVER REPORTS THE ISSUE DOES NOT CAUSE THE DAMAGE. 3. IN REFERENCE TO THOSE WHO CARRIED OUT THE ORDER TO ASSASSINATE THE JESUITS, THEY WERE ACTUALLY DOING THAT -- CARRYING OUT ORDERS. I HAVE ONLY SAID IN PUBLIC WHAT THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING AND EXPRESSING IN A LOW VOICE. 4. THEREFORE, A NATIONAL COMMENTARY DOES NOT ENDANGER THE COUNTRY OR THE ARMED FORCES. THOSE WHO DECIDED TO ADOPT A DECISION, WHOSE SUBSEQUENT CONSEQUENCES THEY SHOULD HAVE ASSESSED, ARE THE ONES WHO ENDANGERED THE U.S. MILITARY AID AND -- IN THE PROCESS -- WITTINGLY OR UNWITTINGLY PLAYED INTO THE FMLN'S HANDS. 5. WE SUPPOSE THAT THERE IS INFORMATION ON THE ISSUE AND THAT IT IS EXCLUSIVELY IN THE HANDS OF CERTAIN GROUPS WHICH, FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER, HAVE FAILED TO TURN IT OVER TO THE APPROPRIATE PERSONS. 6. JUST AS THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND A VAST MAJORITY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE EXPECTED, A FULL INVESTIGATION AND SOLUTION OF THIS CRIME WHICH SHOOK THE WORLD, ALL GOOD SALVADORANS TRUST THAT JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL AND THAT THOSE WHO VIOLATED THE LAW WILL ANSWER FOR THE CRIME THEY HAVE PERPETRATED.

DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL OSCAR BOTERO RESTREPO SAID THAT THE ATTACK WAS THE WORK OF THE EXTRADITABLES, THE ARMED WING OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, ONE OF THE BIGGEST DRUG PROCESSING AND DRUG TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS IN THE WORLD. MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA'S SECOND LARGEST CITY, IS THE HOME OF THE CARTEL AND OF ITS ARMED WING--THE EXTRADITABLES--WHICH DESCRIBED THEMSELVES IN MARCH AS A POLITICAL-MILITARY ORGANIZATION AND DECLARED WAR ON THE COLOMBIAN STATE. THE EXTRADITABLES ANNOUNCED AT THE TIME THAT THEY WERE RELEGATING THEIR STRUGGLE TO PREVENT THE EXTRADITION OF COLOMBIANS TO THE UNITED STATES TO SECOND PLACE AND THAT THEIR TOP PRIORITY WOULD BE TO FIGHT THE STATE, THE OLIGARCHY AND THE MEMBERS OF THE POLICE WHO KIDNAP, TORTURE AND MURDER THE MEMBERS OF THEIR ORGANIZATION AND THEIR FAMILIES. YESTERDAY'S ATTACK WAS THE SECOND TO BE CARRIED OUT AGAINST COLOMBIA'S SPECIAL ANTIDRUG AND COUNTERINSURGENCY ELITE POLICE CORPS. ON 11 MARCH ANOTHER CAR BOMB LOADED WITH OVER 100 KG OF DYNAMITE WAS EXPLODED AGAINST A POLICE VEHICLE ON THE FREEWAY SOUTH OF MEDELLIN. EIGHT POLICEMEN AND NINE CIVILIANS WERE KILLED IN THE EXPLOSION.
DEV-MUC3-1237	BOGOTA, 26 APR 90 -- GOVERNMENT MINISTER HORACIO SERPA URIBE, WHO HAS JUST LEFT THE NATIONAL SOCIAL WELFARE INSTITUTE, HAS DENOUNCED CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ' ASSASSINATION. HE ADDED THAT NO THOUGHT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO SUSPENDING THE ELECTIONS IN THE WAKE OF THIS DEVELOPMENT, AND ADDED THAT THE COUNTRY MUST NOT BE LEFT IN VIOLENT HANDS. THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER COMMENTED FURTHER ON THE TOP M-19 LEADER'S ASSASSINATION: THE OCCURRENCE OF SUCH SAD AND CRIMINAL DEVELOPMENTS IS TRULY A DISGRACE. IT HAS SADDENED EVERYBODY VERY MUCH. I FEEL THAT THIS WAS NOT ONLY AN ATTACK AGAINST FORMER CANDIDATE PIZARRO BUT AN ATTACK AGAINST THE COUNTRY, DEMOCRACY, AND THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. I FEEL THAT WE MUST RESPOND TO AGGRESSIVENESS AND CRIME WITH FEELINGS OF CONCILIATION AND PEACE. HAS ANY THOUGHT BEEN GIVEN TO SUSPENDING THE ELECTIONS AFTER THIS ASSASSINATION, BEARING IN MIND THAT PIZARRO WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CANDIDATES? HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CANDIDATES. THE GOVERNMENT ALWAYS THOUGHT SO. IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT HIGHLY REGARDS THE PEACEMKING PROCESS IT HAS BEEN CARRYING OUT WITH THE M-19, IN WHICH PIZARRO WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A KEY PLAYER. WE HAVE ADOPTED SOME DECISIONS IN THIS REGARD. I AM GOING TO MEET WITH THE HEAD OF STATE AND ALL OF US WILL BE CLOSELY WATCHING THE SAD DEVELOPMENTS WHICH COLOMBIA IS EXPERIENCING WITH A DESIRE TO MEET THE NEED FOR TRANQUILLITY AND COEXISTENCE WHICH, UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE NOT HAD THUS FAR. MR. MINISTER, WHAT DOES THE FACT THAT TWO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN ASSASSINATED IN LESS THAN 40 DAYS REPRESENT TO THE GOVERNMENT? HOW DOES THE GOVERNMENT LOOK BEFORE THE NATION AND THE WORLD? WELL, I REPEAT, THIS IS A VERY SAD CIRCUMSTANCE. THIS IS EXTREMELY WORRISOME, OF COURSE. LIKE ALL COLOMBIANS, WE ARE TROUBLED OVER THE FACT THAT WE ARE CONSTANTLY BEING FLOODED WITH CRIME AND BLOODSHED. THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING THE IMPOSSIBLE TO PROTECT ALL CITIZENS AND TO GUARANTEE THE ELECTIONS AND THE NORMAL DEVELOPMENT OF COLOMBIANS' LIVES. HOWEVER, THERE ARE DELUDED MINDS AND THERE ARE CRIMINALS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN DAMAGING THE COUNTRY. THIS IS AN ATTACK AGAINST COLOMBIA, AGAINST THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE. MR. MINISTER, HAVE YOU AT ANY TIME THOUGHT OF ADOPTING SPECIAL MEASURES? WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE PUBLIC ORDER SITUATION IN COLOMBIA AT THIS TIME? WHAT REPORTS DO YOU HAVE? NO, THERE IS CALM IN GENERAL. THE GOVERNMENT IS VERY WORRIED, OF COURSE. WE ARE GOING TO MEET NOW TO DISCUSS THIS TERRIBLE CASE. HOWEVER, DO YOU NOT THINK THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO GO ON CAMPAIGNING IN PUBLIC AT THIS MOMENT? I WOULD NOT DARE MAKE ANY ASSERTION IN THIS REGARD. WHAT I FEEL IS THAT WE MUST NOT YIELD A SINGLE CENTIMETER TO THE VIOLENT PEOPLE AND THE CRIMINALS. SERPA MADE THESE STATEMENTS A FEW MINUTES AGO AS HE LEFT THE NATIONAL SOCIAL WELFARE INSTITUTE, WHERE AN AUTOPSY IS BEING PERFORMED AT THIS MOMENT ON PIZARRO'S BODY.
DEV-MUC3-1238	SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE -- THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THIS IS THE GOVERNMENT'S CLARIFICATION, WHICH REPRESENTS THE GOVERNMENT'S STAND. DAVID RIVAS OF AFP. MR. PRESIDENT, YOUR REPLIES TO PREVIOUS QUESTIONS HAVE ALREADY ANSWERED MY FIRST QUESTION. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU SOMETHING, HOWEVER. NOW THAT THE DIALOGUE PROCESS IS ABOUT TO START, THE TWO SIDES HAVE APPARENTLY HARDENED THEIR POSITIONS. THE FMLN COMMANDERS HAVE SAID THAT, TO END THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR, THERE MUST BE A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS OF INJUSTICE AND LACK OF DEMOCRACY. THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE, IN TURN, SAID RECENTLY THAT THE FMLN MUST RETURN TO CIVILIAN LIFE AND THAT THERE IS NO NEED TO NEGOTIATE. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT WILL BE NEGOTIATED AND WHAT WILL BE DONE TO END THE WAR THROUGH A DIALOGUE WITH THE FMLN. I AM SURPRISED BY THE REMARKS THAT YOU ARE ATTRIBUTING TO DR. SANTAMARIA, BECAUSE HE IS VERY WELL INFORMED ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED SO FAR. HE IS VERY MUCH AWARE THAT THERE IS POINT TWO OF THE GENEVA AGREEMENT, WHICH NOTES THAT POLITICAL AGREEMENTS MUST BE REACHED IN ORDER TO PUT AN END TO ARMED CONFRONTATION AND THE VIOLENCE THAT IS AFFECTING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. SUBSEQUENTLY, THERE WILL BE A PROCESS FOR DISARMAMENT AND DEMOBILIZATION, REFERRED TO AS THE TOTAL SUSPENSION OF HOSTILITIES IN THE AGREEMENT. I BELIEVE THAT IT IS A MATTER OF REACHING AGREEMENTS. WE, AS A GOVERNMENT, ARE INVOLVED IN THIS BECAUSE WE SEE THE SUFFERING OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT FAIR FOR THEM TO LIVE IN A CLIMATE OF VIOLENCE IN WHICH THERE ARE SO MANY KILLED, SO MUCH DESTRUCTION, AND SO MANY PROBLEMS. AS A GOVERNMENT, WE HAVE ALWAYS ASKED: WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS BARRING THEIR RETURNING TO CIVILIAN LIFE? THEY ARE THE ONLY GROUP THAT HAS NOT JOINED THE SALVADORAN DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. WHAT DO THEY WANT? LET US SEE IF THERE IS ANYTHING REASONABLE THAT CAN BE DONE. THE POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE EXPRESSED WILLINGNESS TO CONSIDER ALL THAT COULD FOSTER OR CONSOLIDATE THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN OUR COUNTRY. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE NO PROBLEMS. I CANNOT SEE ANY HARDENING BY THE GOVERNMENT. I BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN FLEXIBLE. WE HAVE SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN IMMEDIATELY ACCEPTING AS ITS OWN ANY CONSENSUS REACHED BY THE PARTIES. IN OTHER WORDS, AT LEAST YOUR REMARK ON THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT TRUE. I REPEAT, PERHAPS IN THE STYLE OF THE PREVIOUS QUESTION, THAT WE DO NOT WANT TO BE BIASED. IN DUE TIME, WE WILL SEE WHETHER THE FMLN HAS OR HAS NOT BEEN INFLEXIBLE OR HARDENED OR WHATEVER. IT WILL DEPEND ON WHETHER THE FMLN'S PROPOSALS ARE REASONABLE OR NOT. PABLO YACU OF . MR. PRESIDENT, CONCERNING THE ECONOMY, SOME OF THE OPPOSITION POLITICIANS I TALKED WITH OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS HAVE TOLD ME THAT THEY ARE A LITTLE CONCERNED. THEY THINK THAT, BECAUSE DIFFICULTIES HAVE ARISEN, BECAUSE THERE IS A NEW SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY, AND BECAUSE THE VOLUME OF THE U.S. AID HAS DIMINISHED, THE COUNTRY IS RAPIDLY TAKING STEPS THAT OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES HAVE ALREADY TAKEN, TO MEET WITH THE SO-CALLED CONSULTING GROUP FORMED BY THE LEADING WORLD CREDIT INSTITUTIONS AND REQUEST LARGE LOANS TO STABILIZE THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS. THESE POLITICIANS TOLD ME THAT THEY ARE CONCERNED BECAUSE THIS WOULD IMPOSE A HEAVY BURDEN ON THE NEW GOVERNMENT, WHICH WOULD ASSUME OFFICE AFTER 1994. WELL, I THINK THE OPPOSITION POLITICIANS SHOULD TRY TO UNDERSTAND THAT MANY OF THE MEASURES, WHICH CERTAINLY ENTAIL A SACRIFICE FOR THE VARIOUS NATIONAL SECTORS, ARE RESPONSIBLY TAKEN BECAUSE OF THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS. MANY PEOPLE WILL SAY IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO DO THIS OR THAT. I WOULD ONLY LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH, EVEN WITHOUT THE DESTRUCTION AND VIOLENCE CAUSED BY AN IRREGULAR FORCE, SUCH AS THE FMLN, HAVE EXPERIENCED MUCH MORE SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAN THOSE ENCOUNTERED BY EL SALVADOR AT PRESENT. WE WOULD ALSO ENCOUNTER THOSE PROBLEMS IF WE FAIL TO TAKE MEASURES. NEARBY IS NICARAGUA, THE INFLATION RATE OF WHICH HAS REACHED 1,700 PERCENT, ITS FOREIGN DEBT IS ENORMOUS, AND IT IS IMMERSED IN DRAMATIC PROBLEMS. NO MEASURES WERE TAKEN IN DUE TIME IN BRAZIL AND ARGENTINA, ALTHOUGH THESE MEASURES WERE PAINFUL. IF THEY ARE NOT TAKEN ON TIME, THEY WILL BE MUCH MORE PAINFUL LATER, BECAUSE EVENTUALLY SOMETHING WILL HAVE TO BE DONE TO CHECK THE ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT HAS BEEN CREATED. AT THIS TIME, WE ARE TRYING TO STABILIZE THE ECONOMY TO START ITS EFFECTIVE RECOVERY. IT IS BASED ON THIS RECOVERY THAT WE WILL AVOID FOREIGN INDEBTEDNESS, WHICH FOR MANY OTHER COUNTRIES HAS BEEN AN EASY WAY OUT AND AN ALTERNATIVE, WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE ACTED RESPONSIBLY CONCERNING ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.
DEV-MUC3-1239	SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE -- YES, I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD TELL THIS TO THE JUDGE AT THE 4TH PENAL COURT. FRANKLY, AS I SAID, THIS CASE IS NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE COURT. THE JUDGE IS THE ONE WHO CAN ORDER FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE CASE. YOUR QUESTIONS RELATE TO DOUBTS AND CONCERNS THAT THE JUDGE HAS BEFORE HIM. HE CAN SUMMON ANYONE TO TESTIFY. I UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAS ALREADY SUMMONED SOME TOP OFFICERS. I CAN ONLY SAY THIS: YOU HAVE JUST MENTIONED A MEETING IN WHICH SUPPOSEDLY I WAS PRESENT. YOU ALSO SAID THAT IT WAS AT THAT MEETING THAT THE MURDER WAS PLANNED. THERE IS MUCH SPECULATION, THEREFORE I THINK THAT WE MUST REMAIN COOL-HEADED. IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE ARE SPECULATING WHEN THEY SAY THAT THIS COULD HAPPEN, THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED, OR THIS COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME HAVE SAID THAT THERE IS A COVER UP, BUT COLONEL RIVAS HIMSELF WAS THE ONE WHO DISCOVERED WHO COMMITTED THE CRIME. THERE ARE MANY QUESTIONS, WHICH IS NATURAL. HOWEVER, THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT ... FOR EXAMPLE, I MADE A STATEMENT FOR THE PROGRAM "60 MINUTES;" I WAS INTERVIEWED FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF, BUT OBVIOUSLY MY REPLIES WERE NOT AIRED FOR SOME REASON. HOWEVER, I SAID THAT IT IS NO SECRET IN OUR COUNTRY THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY PEOPLE, A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE, WHO FEEL THAT AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER SOME OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS WERE IN FACT LINKED TO THE FMLN. THEREFORE, IN THIS CASE, ALL THOSE WHO HAVE SAID ANYTHING TO THAT EFFECT WOULD HAVE TO BE INVESTIGATED. WOULD THAT BE CALLED FOR? WHAT I MEAN IS THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE A DECISION BASED ON SPECULATION. FURTHERMORE, DURING THE INVESTIGATIONS -- CONDUCTED BY THE INVESTIGATIVE COMMISSION OF CRIMINAL ACTIONS, AN AUXILIARY LEGAL ORGAN -- WE THOUGHT IT WAS CONVENIENT AT A GIVEN TIME, SINCE WE HAD ENOUGH EVIDENCE ON A GROUP OF PEOPLE WE BELIEVE COMMITTED THE CRIME, THAT THE CASE SHOULD BE HANDLED BY THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. THEREFORE, THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TODAY CONTINUES TO INVESTIGATE THE CASE AND DECIDES WHETHER TO INTERROGATE SOMEONE OR NOT. IF THERE IS ANY DOUBT, THE JUDICIAL BRANCH CAN ORDER THE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THIS OR THAT. WHETHER SOMEONE IS INTERROGATED BY A JUDGE OR BY THE COMMISSION IS IRRELEVANT; THE JUDGE MUST DECIDE. I BELIEVE THAT IN THIS CASE THE JUDGE SHOULD INVESTIGATE. AS I SAID BEFORE, I THINK THAT THERE HAS BEEN PROGRESS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE HONOR COMMISSION WILL BE SUMMONED, AND THAT ANOTHER MAY BE SUMMONED AFTERWARD. COULD YOU TELL US IN ENGLISH. YOU SAID THAT YOU DO NOT THINK THAT IT IS NECESSARY, THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE CRITICIZED THE JESUITS, AND IF YOU ARE GOING TO START INVESTIGATING PEOPLE, WHY NOT INVESTIGATE EVERYONE WHO HAS CRITICIZED THE JESUITS. THE FACT REMAINS, HOWEVER, THAT NOT EVERYBODY IS IN A POSITION TO REPROVE THE JESUITS, NOT EVERYONE WAS IN THE MILITARY HIERARCHY, NOT EVERYONE WAS INVOLVED IN THE ALTO MANDO . THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE ALTO MANDO WHO ARE KNOWN TO HATE THE JESUITS, WHO ARE KNOWN TO HAVE CRITICIZED THEM IN THE PAST. WHY DO YOU NOT THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE CORRECT FOR THOSE PEOPLE TO BE INVESTIGATED DIRECTLY? FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD SAY THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF OFFICERS IN THE ARMED FORCES AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER, WHETHER LATELY OR EARLIER, THAT THERE WAS A WIDESPREAD BELIEF OF SOME SORT OF PARTICIPATION BY THE ... SOME OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS WITH THE FMLN. THIS IS NOT FOR US AT THIS POINT AND TIME TO DECIDE WHETHER IT IS TRUE OR UNTRUE. IT IS SIMPLY SOMETHING THAT WAS BELIEVED OUT THERE, AND THEREFORE, IT IS UP TO THE JUDGE TO DECIDE WHETHER HE WILL ONLY INTERVIEW ONE PERSON WHO BELIEVED THIS, OR WHETHER HE IS GOING TO INTERVIEW MANY PEOPLE. THERE HAS BEEN ALSO THE FACT THAT IT WELL COULD HAVE BEEN THE ACT OF THE FMLN, THE ACT OF INDIVIDUAL GROUPS. THERE WERE ALSO SPECULATIONS AT THE BEGINNING WHEN THE ASSASSINATION WAS COMMITTED AS TO WHO COULD HAVE COMMITTED THE CRIME. SO THERE ARE OTHER GROUPS THAT COULD HAVE COMMITTED THE CRIME, AND THEREFORE, THERE COULD BE OTHERS THAT WE COULD HAVE FOLLOWED THE INVESTIGATING. BUT, I THINK IT IS ALL UP TO THE JUDGE NOW WHO WILL HE CALL TO TESTIFY, WHO WILL HE CALL TO INTERROGATE, AND IF HE FINDS ANY NEED, HE HAS ALL THE POWER TO INSTRUCT THE INVESTIGATIVE UNIT TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON ANYTHING THAT HE REACHES. IT IS NOT UP TO EXECUTIVE BRANCH RIGHT NOW TO DECIDE WHO IS GOING TO COME UP WITH TESTIMONY WITH THE JUDGE. IT IS UP TO THE JUDGE TO DECIDE.
DEV-MUC3-1240	SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE -- ROLANDO GONZALEZ, LOS ANGELES TIMES. MR. PRESIDENT, I WANT TO MAKE A QUESTION THAT WAS MADE IN SPANISH BEFORE AND IT'S RELATED ABOUT COLONEL OCHOA PEREZ. HE HAS BEEN A HARD-LINE MILITARY AND DON'T YOU THINK THAT HIS GOT TO BE POSSIBLE? THIS IS ONE AND I GOT A SECOND ONE. CAN YOU TELL US IN ENGLISH WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE RELATION WITH THE NEW NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT RECENT MACHINEGUN TRAFFIC OF THE GUERRILLAS? WELL, WITH THE FIRST CASE MY OPINION IS THAT ANYBODY THAT HAS ANY INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS SHOULD -- INSTEAD OF SPECULATE WITH IT PUBLICLY -- SHOULD GO STRAIGHT TO THE COURT THAT IS IN CHARGE OF THE CASE AND GIVE ALL THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO HIM OR THAT HE IS KNOWLEDGEABLE OF, AND THEN HAVE THE JUDGE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I THINK THAT MERE SPECULATION IN PUBLIC IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR THE JUDICIAL PROCESS BECAUSE IT CREATES PROBLEMS FOR IT. SECONDLY, EVEN THOUGH HE WAS A HIGH-RANKING OFFICER, IN CASES LIKE THIS, IT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE OPINION OF A SPECIFIC MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES IS ONE WHICH IS TOTALLY TRUE OR TOTALLY FALSE . YOU CANNOT SIMPLY GO BY THAT AS A WAY TO SIMPLY STATE THAT HIS STATEMENTS ARE TRUE. IT IS VERY INTERESTING TO SEE THAT WHEREAS BEFORE NO ONE REALLY WOULD BELIEVE COL. OCHOA, ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYONE WANTS TO GIVE HIM ALL THE CREDIBILITY IN THIS CASE. I AM NOT SAYING THAT WHAT HE SAID IS TRUE OR UNTRUE. MY POINT IS THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE DEBATED PUBLICLY; THAT ANYBODY -- COL. OCHOA, MEMBERS OF THE JESUIT COMMUNITY, OR ANYBODY ELSE -- WHO HAS ANY INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE TRIAL SHOULD GO TO THE JUDGE AND GIVE HIM THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE HELPING THE PROCESS AND NOT MERE SPECULATIONS IN PUBLIC. WITH RESPECT TO THE RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA, WE DISCUSSED THIS WITH ONE OF THE ADVISERS OF MRS. CHAMORRO DURING OUR VISIT AND WE DECIDED TO INITIATE PLANS AND, THEREFORE, WE ARE WILLING TO REINITIATE THE PROCESS. HER ADVISER WAS VERY CLEAR TO STATE THAT THEY WILL BY NO MEANS AID THE FMLN IN THAT RESPECT. WE THINK THAT WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING BETWEEN THE 25TH OF FEBRUARY AND THE 25TH OF APRIL IS THAT THE FMLN THOUGHT THAT IT WAS TIME TO GET ALL THAT WAS LEFT IN NICARAGUA....[CORRECTS HIMSELF) OUT OF NICARAGUA BECAUSE THEY KNEW OF THE PROBLEMS THEY WOULD FACE WITH THE NEW GOVERNMENT, AND THAT THEY COULD NO LONGER GO ABOUT FREELY IN NICARAGUA WITH THEIR WEAPONS AND THEIR LOGISTIC SUPPORT. THEREFORE, THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO BRING THEM IN. IN THAT CASE THERE WAS A GROUP OF FMLN MEMBERS WHO WERE DETAINED IN HONDURAS WITH THE HELP OF THE HONDURAN AUTHORITIES, AND IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THEY HAD BEEN SHIPPING WEAPONS BY LAND THROUGH HONDURAN TERRITORY, BUT THAT GROUP WAS DETAINED. THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT; THANK YOU, MR. FOREIGN MINISTER. JOURNALISTS, THANK YOU.
DEV-MUC3-1241	BOGOTA, 26 APR 90 -- GOOD EVENING. WE COLOMBIANS HAD NOT GOTTEN OVER YESTERDAY'S CRUEL ATTACK IN MEDELLIN WHEN WE WERE CONFRONTED WITH ANOTHER DISGRACE THAT TOOK THE LIFE OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CARLOS PIZARRO. IN A MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC, THE GOVERNMENT VOICED ITS DEEP ANGER AND SADNESS OVER THIS CRIMINAL ATTACK AND IT RATIFIED ITS DETERMINATION TO CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITHOUT DISMAY AGAINST ALL FORMS OF CRIMES AND THE CRIMINALS WHO ARE SO INFAMOUSLY ATTACKING PEACE AND DEMOCRACY. THIS IS NO TIME TO ABANDON ANY ATTITUDE THAT IS DEEMED ADVISABLE FOR THE NATION. IN THE FACE OF THE FRATRICIDAL AND ANTI-PATRIOTIC VIOLENCE, WE MUST ANSWER WITH ACTIONS OF UNDERSTANDING AND CONCILIATION, WITH DECISIONS THAT WILL DISMANTLE THE BANDS OF CRIMINALS WHO ARE DOING SUCH SERIOUS HARM TO THE PEOPLE AND WITH THE DETERMINATION THAT WILL RENEW FAITH IN DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES AND IN THE PURPOSE TO ACHIEVE THE BEST LEVELS OF COEXISTENCE. THE GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO DO THAT. HOWEVER, THIS RESPONSIBILITY LIES WITH ALL COLOMBIANS OF GOODWILL. FROM EACH OF OUR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN, WE DEMAND POSITIVE ACTIONS AND A GREAT SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SAFEGUARDING THE CITIZENS' SECURITY THROUGHOUT THE NATION. THE PEACE, UNDERSTANDING, AND CONCILIATION TO WHICH CARLOS PIZARRO WAS COMMITTED SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE BASIC GOALS OF THE COUNTRY AND OF ITS CITIZENS. ALL THE NECESSARY MEASURES THAT WILL LEAD TO CLARIFYING THAT TREACHEROUS CRIME ARE BEING TAKEN TO DETERMINE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE AND THEN PUNISH THEM. TO THIS EFFECT, THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTION WILL BE VERY SEVERE, AND THE INVESTIGATING AUTHORITIES ARE ALREADY BEING PROVIDED VERY AMPLE COOPERATION. THE GOVERNMENT MAINTAINS DIRECT COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT LEADERS, AND IT HAS BEEN ATTENTIVE TO ITS DEMANDS, CHARGES, AND CONCERNS. THERE IS A MARKED INTEREST BECAUSE THERE CONTINUES TO BE DIRECT RELATIONS WITH ALL POLITICAL PARTIES, THE VARIOUS POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ASSOCIATIONS, AND THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES CONCERNING THE IMPLEMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF SECURITY AND INDISPENSABLE GUARANTEES SO THAT WE WILL HOLD THE ELECTIONS ON 27 MAY, AS THE PEOPLE WANT. NATIONAL COEXISTENCE, TOGETHER WITH THE CITIZENS' DEMANDS FOR REFORMS, WILL CONTINUE TO BE A BASIC GOAL OF THE GOVERNMENT OF DR. VIRGILIO BARCO, WHO WILL TOMORROW ADDRESS THE COLOMBIANS. M-19 HAS ASKED THE GOVERNMENT TO ALLOW IT TO MAKE PUBLIC ITS FEELINGS AND OPINIONS IN THE FACE OF THIS GREAT TRAGEDY. THROUGH ME, AND ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF LAW 42 OF 1985, THE GOVERNMENT HAS REQUESTED THIS AIR TIME SO THAT ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, SPOKESMAN OF THE POLITICAL PARTY WHOSE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WAS BRUTALLY MURDERED TODAY, WILL BE ABLE TO FREELY EXPRESS HIS IDEAS. THOSE WHO SEEK TO EXCLUDE FROM THE ELECTORAL PROCESS A POLITICAL PARTY -- REGARDLESS OF WHICH ONE IT MAY BE -- WILL NOT ACHIEVE IT, BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT WILL GUARANTEE THAT ITS VOICE WILL CONTINUE TO BE HEARD. DESPITE OF THE DIFFICULTIES, COLOMBIAN DEMOCRACY WILL WIN.
DEV-MUC3-1242	BOGOTA, 24 APR 90 -- THE LEFTIST PATRIOTIC UNION TODAY ASKED COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO TO BE ADMITTED TO THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS HOLDING WITH DIVERSE POLITICAL GROUPS TO REACH AN AGREEMENT THAT WILL PERMIT THE INTRODUCTION OF NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS. THE UP NATIONAL DIRECTORATE MET TODAY WITH BARCO AND GAVE HIM A LETTER NOTING THAT THE EXCLUSION OF SOCIAL FORCES IN THE NEGOTIATIONS MAY AGAIN BE A MOCKERY OF THE PEOPLE. IT AGAIN ASKED FOR PROTECTION FOR THE LIVES OF ITS MILITANTS. SINCE IT WAS FOUNDED IN 1985, MORE THAN 1,000 UP MEMBERS HAVE BEEN KILLED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THE UP EXPLAINS IN ITS LETTER THAT THE ASSASSINATION ON 22 MARCH OF BERNARDO JARAMILLO, ITS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, FORCED IT TO WITHDRAW FROM THE 27 MAY ELECTIONS. THIS DID NOT DETER IT, HOWEVER, FROM ITS STRUGGLE FOR A PLEBISCITE AND FROM CALLING FOR A NATIONAL, POPULAR AND DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY. THE UP ADDED THAT A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, WHICH WILL REPRESENT ALL POPULAR SECTORS, WILL BE CHARGED WITH DRAFTING CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS. THE REFORMS MUST THEN BE SUBMITTED TO A PLEBISCITE. A WEEK AGO, THE LIBERAL PARTY, SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE PARTY, 19 APRIL MOVEMENT , AND NATIONAL SALVATION MOVEMENT MET TO TRY TO REACH AN AGREEMENT THAT WILL PERMIT HOLDING A NATIONAL PLEBISCITE ON 27 MAY TO APPROVE SUBSTANTIAL REFORMS TO THE STATE. GOVERNMENT MINISTER HORACIO SERPA URIBE STATED THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT AND DOES NOT SEEK TO IMPOSE ITS CRITERIA ON THE WILL TO EFFECT CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM. HE ADDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION IS VERY CLEAR AND SEEKS TO RESPOND TO THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. ALSO, THE UP CONVENED POLITICAL PARTIES, SOCIAL FORCES, STUDENTS, AND COLOMBIANS IN GENERAL WHO WERE EXCLUDED FROM THESE NEGOTIATIONS, TO UNITE A PROPOSAL ON THE 27 MAY PLEBISCITE. FINALLY, THE UP DIRECTORATE ASKED, AS A CONTRIBUTION TO PEACE IN THE COUNTRY, TO BE ABLE TO MEET WITH THE REBEL FORCES.
DEV-MUC3-1243	BOGOTA, 27 APR 90 -- COLOMBIANS, DURING THESE MONTHS OF NATIONAL TRAGEDY WE HAVE BEEN HIT BY EVENTS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. VIOLENCE STRIKES THE HEARTS OF OUR INSTITUTIONS, VALUES, DEMOCRACY, AND OUR BEST MEN. THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THOSE ENGAGED IN VIOLENCE IS TO PREVENT DEMOCRACY FROM FUNCTIONING. THAT IS WHY THEY HAVE UNLEASHED THEIR EVIL AGAINST OPTIONS FOR CHANGES THAT COULD STRENGTHEN DEMOCRACY AND PREVENT VIOLENCE IN COLOMBIA. BRAVE COLOMBIANS HAVE BEEN MURDERED, ONE BY ONE. THEIR EXISTENCE WAS A THREAT TO THE SURVIVAL OF VIOLENT PRACTICES. IT IS NOT A COINCIDENCE THAT DURING THE CURRENT ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN THREE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN MURDERED. IT IS NOT A COINCIDENCE EITHER THAT OTHER BRAVE MINDS THAT ADVOCATED REFORM HAD BEEN KILLED BEFORE IN THAT STRUGGLE. RODRIGO LARA, WHO WAS MURDERED SIX YEARS ON 23 APRIL, WAS THE FIRST TO DENOUNCE THE GRAVE EFFECTS OF DRUG TRAFFICKING ON THE STABILITY OF OUR INSTITUTIONS. THOSE WHO KILLED HIM WANTED TO OPEN PATHS FOR THE SO-CALLED CRIME TOLERANCE. GUILLERMO CANO, A BRAVE NEWSMAN, REPRESENTED A FREE, CRITICAL PRESS, SUCH AS IS NEEDED IN A TRUE DEMOCRACY. HIS KILLERS THOUGHT THAT BY DROWNING OUT HIS VOICE THEY WOULD INTIMIDATE THE DEFENDERS OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH. LUIS CARLOS GALAN WAS KILLED EIGHT MONTHS AGO. BY KILLING HIM, THEY SOUGHT TO ASSASSINATE A HOPE OF RENOVATION AND CHANGE AND A DEEP CONVICTION FOR THE NEED TO RADICALLY TRANSFORM POLITICAL HABITS AND THE CLIMATE OF CORRUPTION, IMMORALITY, AND INDIFFERENCE IN THE FACE OF CRIME. THIS INDIFFERENCE LED TO THE EMERGENCE OF THE GREAT EVILS THAT ARE CAUSING BLOODSHED IN THE COUNTRY. BERNARDO JARAMILLO STRUGGLED FOR A PEACEFUL, DEMOCRATIC LEFT THAT REJECTED ARMED STRUGGLE AND THAT WANTED TO BUILD A MORE JUST SOCIETY. BY KILLING HIM, THE CRIMINALS SOUGHT TO BLOCK THE PATHS TO LEGITIMATE PROTEST WITHIN THE LAW. CARLOS PIZARRO, THE LAST LINK IN THIS MACABRE CHAIN THAT INCLUDES SO MANY OTHERS, REPRESENTED THE POSSIBILITY FOR GUERRILLA GROUPS TO LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND JOIN INSTITUTIONAL POLITICS, OR FOR WEAPONS TO BE REPLACED BY LEGAL INSTRUMENTS TO STRUGGLE FOR LEGITIMATE IDEALS. BY KILLING HIM IN A DASTARDLY AND COWARDLY MANNER YESTERDAY, THEY SOUGHT TO DESTROY THE PROCESS OF RECONCILIATION AND REINCORPORATION OF ARMED GROUPS INTO CIVIL LIFE. THE DEATH OF OUR COUNTRYMEN SHOULD NOT BE IN VAIN. IT STRIKES DEEP IN OUR HEARTS. IT AFFECTS THE SPIRIT PROFOUNDLY. IT MUST, THEREFORE, AWAKEN THE NATIONAL CONSCIENCE, BECAUSE THOSE CRIMES ARE NOT MERELY VILE CRIMES AGAINST UNARMED GREAT MEN WHO BELIEVED IN THE STRENGTH OF IDEALS. THESE HAVE BEEN CRIMES AGAINST OUR BASIC VALUES, AGAINST THE CLEAN IDEALS OF PROGRESS AND PEACE THAT THESE MEN REPRESENTED. WE MUST NOT BE MISTAKEN. THOSE WHO KILLED OUR LEADERS DID NOT EXTINGUISH THE NOBLE CAUSE FOR WHICH THEY GAVE THEIR LIVES. THEIR VALUES WILL PREVAIL. THEY ARE OUR VALUES. THEIR HOPES STILL LIVE. THOSE HOPES BELONG TO ALL COLOMBIANS. THEIR DREAM WILL NEVER DISAPPEAR. IT IS THE DREAM WE ALL HAVE OF ATTAINING PEACE AND PROSPERITY. THAT IS WHY I PRAISE WHAT ANTONIO NAVARRO SAID LAST NIGHT: "I INVITE THE M-19 TO CONTINUE WALKING ALONG THE PATH THAT PIZARRO CHARTED. TERRORISM'S GOAL HAS BEEN TO CLOSE THE PATHS TO CHANGE, RENOVATION, AND REFORM. OUR PATH, ON THE CONTRARY, IS TO MAKE PEACEFUL, DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION VIABLE. IT IS A REVOLUTION OF HOPE. THIS DEEP CRISIS WILL NOT BE SOLVED BY RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS IMPOSED ON THE INSTRUMENTS OF DEMOCRACY, BUT BY UNITING EFFORTS OF ALL GOOD COLOMBIANS TO REPAIR THE ROADS TO CHANGE, RENOVATION, AND REFORM.
DEV-MUC3-1244	BOGOTA, 27 APR 90 I AM HAPPY THAT NAVARRO, OVER THE TELEVISION, CALLED FOR COMMON SENSE AND FOR PIZARRO'S FUNERAL TO BE CONDUCTED IN PEACE TOMORROW. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW, THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE SO THAT THE M-19 AND THE OTHER POLITICAL PARTIES CAN CARRY ON THEIR CAMPAIGN ACTIVITIES. THE GOVERNMENT AND I HAVE FULLY SUPPORTED THE ARMY, THE POLICE, THE DAS , AND ALL OF THE AUTHORITIES CHARGED WITH MAINTAINING ORDER. THESE AGENCIES ARE AWARE OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND ARE MAKING GREAT EFFORTS TO CARRY OUT THEIR DUTIES EFFICIENTLY. AT THIS TIME, THERE IS A TENDENCY TO OVERLOOK THE RESULTS ACHIEVED IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE VIOLENT ONES AND THE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ACHIEVED. I UNDERSTAND THE IMPATIENCE AND THE DESIRE FOR DEFINITIVE RESULTS AGAINST NOT ONLY DRUG TRAFFICKING BUT ALL OTHER EXPRESSIONS OF VIOLENCE AS WELL. I WILL NOW MENTION SOME OF THE MEASURES THAT COMPLEMENT THOSE THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN TAKEN. THE GOVERNMENT HAS PROPOSED THE CREATION OF A HIGH-LEVEL COMMISSION, IN WHICH THE POLITICAL PARTIES ARE REPRESENTED, TO FOLLOW UP THE ELECTORAL PROCESS AND TO ASSESS THE SECURITY MEASURES THAT THE PUBLIC FORCE AND THE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN PROVIDING FOR ALL CANDIDATES. THIS COMMISSION CAN BY ITSELF PROPOSE NEW MEASURES TO REINFORCE THE ELECTORAL GUARANTEES IN VARIOUS AREAS. IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER AND THOSE IN CHARGE OF SECURITY WILL MEET WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF EACH OF THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS TO CONSIDER THE EXISTING PROTECTION MEASURES. THE COMMISSION MET WITH THE M-19 AT THE SECURITY COUNCIL TODAY AND WILL MEET WITH THE OTHER POLITICAL MOVEMENTS IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE EFFORTS TO PROVIDE THE BEST POSSIBLE PROTECTION FOR ALL OF THE CANDIDATES. THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO REDUCE THE RISK OF EACH OF THE CANDIDATES TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL. FOR THIS REASON, THE GOVERMENT WILL REVISE THE EXISTING SITUATION REGARDING MOBILIZATION AND LOCATION OF THE CANDIDATES. ALSO, THE GOVERNMENT WILL DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF ELITE POLICEMEN, WHO HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE GREATEST EFFICIENCY IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TERRORISM AND THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS. THE 1ST ARMY DIVISION COMMANDER HAS BEEN ASSIGNED THE SPECIFIC TASK OF COORDINATING ALL FORCES, SECURITY AGENCIES, AND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE MEDELLIN AREA. THE COUNTRY KNOWS THAT THIS GOVERNMENT HAS ENCOURAGED A BROAD, PARTICIPATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM PROCESS. TWO YEARS AGO, THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSED A PLEBISCITE AND THEN PRESENTED TO THE CONGRESS A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS BILL. IN THIS WAY, THE GOVERNMENT INTERPRETED THE NATIONAL FEELING, WHICH DEMANDS A MORE EFFICIENT ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE AND EVEN MORE STRINGENT ANTITERRORIST MEASURES, FOR WHICH IT IS NECESSARY TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION. THE GOVERNMENT ALSO ECHOED THE PEOPLE'S CALL FOR STRONGER INSTITUTIONS AND A MORE EFFICIENT AND REPRESENTATIVE CONGRESS. COLOMBIANS KNOW THAT THE CURRENT EVILS WILL BE DEFINITIVELY OVERCOME BY EXPANDING AND STRENGTHENING OUR DEMOCRACY EVEN FURTHER, CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE CITIZENS' PARTICIPATION IN THE DECISIONS THAT CONCERN THEM MOST. I WANT TO REAFFIRM THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO DO EVEYTHING NECESSARY SO THAT IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS WE CAN PAVE THE WAY FOR CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS.
DEV-MUC3-1245	BOGOTA, 27 APR 90 FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: THE MURDER OF CARLOS PIZARRO SOUGHT BOTH TO DISRUPT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS, AS WELL AS TO DESTROY THE PROCESS OF RECONCILIATION THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND M- 19 HAD CAREFULLY BUILT, SURPASSING NUMEROUS OBSTACLES. IT ALSO SEEKS TO WEAKEN THE STATE AND MAKE COLOMBIANS LOSE FAITH IN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. HOWEVER, THOSE WHO FOMENT VIOLENCE WILL NOT MANAGE TO WEAKEN A STRONG DEMOCRACY THAT IS SUPPORTED BY ALL COLOMBIANS OR TO DESTROY THE PATH OF PEACE THAT WE HAVE BUILT AFTER SO MANY DIFFICULTIES. TWO OF THESE DIFFICULTIES STEM BACK MORE THAN FIVE DECADES. THE FIRST DIFFICULTY WAS TO BUILD AN ATMOSPHERE OF PEACE IN A COUNTRY WHERE THE VIOLENCE WE HAVE INHERITED FLARED UP IN THE FIFTIES, AND AFTER HAVING EVOLVED, IT HAS TAKEN ON DIFFERENT FORMS, SUCH AS NARCO-TERRORISM AND BANDS OF HIRED ASSASSINS ENCOURAGED BY GROUPS OF THE EXTREME RIGHT. THE SECOND OBSTACLE, ALONG WITH THE PREVIOUS ONE, IS THE LACK OF TOLERANCE FOR POLITICAL PLURALISM. EVEN PROGRESSIVE IDEAS ARE MANY TIMES CONSIDERED DANGEROUS BY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT REALIZE THAT THE COLD WAR IS OVER. A PLURALIST DEMOCRACY IS NOT AFRAID OF COMMUNISM. ON THE CONTRARY, IT ACCEPTS COMMUNISM, BUT IT DOES NOT ACCEPT VIOLENCE, REGARDLESS OF ITS SOURCE. THE USE OF WEAPONS BOTH TO DEFEND AN IDEOLOGY, AS WELL AS TO FIGHT AGAINST IT, IS UNACCEPTABLE IN A PLURALIST DEMOCRACY. THE PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRAGIC MURDER OF CARLOS PIZARRO WILL NOT MANAGE TO DESTROY WHAT HAS BEEN BEEN ACHIEVED, THAT IS, A CLEAR, VIABLE, AND DEFINED PATH TO PEACE. THE OBLIGATION WE HAVE AHEAD OF US AND THAT WE WILL CARRY OUT UNITED IS TO KEEP THAT PATH OF PEACE OPEN. ALL COLOMBIANS ADMIRE THE PEACE INITIATIVES OF THE M-19, AND WE SHARE THE GRIEF OF THE RELATIVES AND FOLLOWERS OF CARLOS PIZARRO, BECAUSE THEIR SADNESS AND ANGER IS SHARED BY ALL COLOMBIANS WHO LOVE PEACE. FACTS SHOW THAT THE M-19 MEMBERS WISELY ADOPTED THE DECISION TO REJOIN DEMOCRACY AND REMAIN IN DEMOCRACY, TO STRUGGLE FOR PEACE, AND TO PROMOTE LEGALLY THE REFORMS THEY CONSIDER NECESSARY. WHEN THEY ABANDONED THEIR WEAPONS, THEY DID NOT ABANDON THE STRUGGLE FOR THEIR IDEALS. THEY HAVE ALL THEIR RIGHTS, BECAUSE THEY ARE NO LONGER A GUERRILLA GROUP. M-19 IS NOW A POLITICAL PARTY, WITH ALL RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF A POLITICAL PARTY AND WHOSE IDEAS SHOULD BE TOLERATED. THOSE WHO, THROUGH VIOLENCE, ARE TRYING TO BRING DOWN THE M-19 FLAG AND TO PREVENT ITS CANDIDATES FROM RUNNING IN THE ELECTIONS AND TO STOP THEM FROM CONDUCTING POLITICAL CAMPAIGNING, ARE NOT JUST THE ENEMIES OF THAT MOVEMENT, THEY ARE THE ENEMIES OF PEACE. THEY ARE TRYING TO DESTROY THE PATH THAT WAS BUILT FOR THE REINCORPORATION OF THE GUERRILLA GROUPS INTO CIVILIAN LIFE. THE MATERIAL AND INTELLECTUAL AUTHORS OF CARLOS PIZARRO'S MURDER ARE THE ENEMIES OF DEMOCRACY, BECAUSE THEY HOPE TO SABOTAGE THE ELECTIONS AND PREVENT NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR POLITICAL PARTICIPATION. THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ALLOW THE VOICE OF M-19 TO BE SILENCED. THEREFORE, THE GOVERNMENT YESTERDAY REQUESTED AIRTIME ON TELEVISION SO THAT ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, LEADER OF THAT PARTY, COULD EXPRESS HIS OPINIONS TO ALL COLOMBIANS.
DEV-MUC3-1246	BOGOTA, 27 APR 90 WHEN THE CONVERGENCE OF OPINIONS ON THE FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS OF THE CREATION OF A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY IS MADE PUBLIC, THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRIBUTE TOWARD THE COUNTING OF THE RELEVANT BALLOT PAPERS. THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES IT IS NECESSARY TO REDUCE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THE RISK FOR EACH OF THE CANDIDATES. DESPITE THE STRICT SECURITY MEASURES TAKEN BY CARLOS PIZARRO, THE SUICIDAL CALLING OF A HIRED ASSASSIN AT THE SERVICE OF EVIL INTERESTS ENDED HIS LIFE. IN VIEW OF THESE TOTALLY IRRATIONAL METHODS, LARGE NUMBERS OF BODYGUARDS, BULLETPROOF VESTS, AND PRACTICAL SECURITY MEASURES COULD HELP, BUT THEY ARE NOT ENOUGH. IT IS NECESSARY FOR AUTHORITIES AND CAMPAIGN OFFICIALS TO TAKE MAXIMUM PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES. THERE MUST BE MORE MODERN AND DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH THE PEOPLE. I ADMIRE THE COURAGE OF THE CANDIDATES WHO HAVE GONE TO PUBLIC SQUARES, BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT THE HEALTH OF DEMOCRACY AND THE STABILITY OF INSTITUTIONS DEPENDS ON THE LIVES OF THE CANDIDATES. SO THIS CAMPAIGN CAN TAKE PLACE UNDER THE BEST OF CONDITIONS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR CANDIDATES TO RUN THE RISKS INVOLVED IN TRADITIONAL FORMS OF PROSELYTISM, THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO INCREASE TELEVISION TIME FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES OF THE PARTIES AND MOVEMENTS THAT ARE REPRESENTED IN CONGRESS, ON BOTH NATIONAL AND REGIONAL CHANNELS. IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT WILL ALLOW THE FREE USE OF RADIO STATIONS FOR THE SAME PURPOSE AND WILL GIVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADVERTISEMENTS. WE ARE TRYING FOR A MORE MODERN CAMPAIGN IN WHICH NEW TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED TO EXPLAIN THE PROGRAMS OF THE CANDIDATES SO THAT THEY CAN DIRECTLY MAKE CONTACT WITH CITIZENS AND THEIR FAMILIES IN THEIR OWN HOMES. BESIDES, THE GOVERNMENT WILL INTENSIFY ITS CIVIC CAMPAIGN BY INVITING ALL CITIZENS TO VOTE IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS. THEIR VOTE FOR ANY OF THE CANDIDATES OR EVEN A BLANK VOTE IS AN EXPRESSION OF THE PEOPLE'S REJECTION OF VIOLENCE. IT IS A WAY OF RESOLVING CONFLICTS BY PEACEFUL AND DEMOCRATIC MEANS. TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS IS TO VOTE FOR PEACE, FOR DEMOCRACY AND TOLERANCE. AMID THE SITUATION IN WHICH THIS COUNTRY IS LIVING, VOTING IS AN OBLIGATION. NO CITIZEN WITH A RIGHT TO VOTE CAN AFFORD TO REMAIN AT HOME AND REMAIN INDIFFERENT.
DEV-MUC3-1247	TEGUCIGALPA, 23 APR 90 -- WHAT I HAVE TO SAY THIS EVENING IS THAT WE MADE A CORRECT DECISION. THE ARMED FORCES' BUDGET WAS REDUCED BY 10 PERCENT; TO ASK FOR A GREATER REDUCTION IS NOT TO KNOW OUR COUNTRY'S REALITY AND TO DESTROY THE ARMED FORCES. TO REDUCE THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES' BUDGET BY 50 PERCENT IS TANTAMOUNT TO DISMANTLING IT, AND I FOR ONE AM NOT WILLING TO MAKE THAT DECISION. I AGREED TO TAKE THE CORRECT PATH AT THE RIGHT MOMENT; TO REDIRECT THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES AND TO SEE THEY ALSO ACT WITH AUSTERITY AND IN THE BEST NATIONAL INTEREST. IT IS EASY TO CRITICIZE AND SAY THINGS, BUT WHEN THESE PEOPLE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE THIS, NOTHING WAS DONE. I HAVE ACTED. GERMAN REYES OF ACAN-EFE. GOOD EVENING. BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE I THINK WE SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO THE HOUSEWIVES FOR HAVING RUINED THEIR SOAP OPERA. REGARDING THE GREEN BATTALIONS YOU MENTIONED, MR. PRESIDENT, WHICH ARE GOING TO BE INSTALLED IN YAMALES -- WHERE THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN BEFORE THE CONTRAS ENTERED -- HOW ARE THE ONUCA OFFICERS GOING TO VERIFY THAT THE CONTRA WITHDRAWAL FROM HONDURAN TERRITORY? THERE IS NO PROBLEM. THE YAMALES CAMP IS INSIDE HONDURAN TERRITORY. THERE ARE MECHANISMS THAT ALLOW ONUCA AND CIAV FORCES TO CONTROL THESE PERSONS. ONCE MORE I WOULD LIKE TO REFER TO THE POSITION YOU ARE TAKING: WHY NOT SEE THINGS POSITIVELY? INSTEAD OF SAYING WE HAD CONTRAS HERE FOR 10 YEARS, SAY THAT NOW WE DO NOT HAVE ANY. I THINK THIS IS THE TYPE OF OPTIMISM WE SHOULD IMPRESS UPON THE COUNTRY. LET US NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT YESTERDAY, INSTEAD BUILD ON TODAY'S REALITY. I AM VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE AT THIS NEWS CONFERENCE AND TO BE ABLE TO TELL MY FELLOW CITIZENS AND YOU THAT NO LONGER ARE WE TO HAVE CONTRAS IN HONDURAS -- A POSITIVE STEP. IN THIS REGARD THE GREEN BATTALIONS AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE TAKING ACTION TO ADMINISTER A TERRITORY THAT ONLY YESTERDAY WAS RELATIVELY OUT OF CONTROL OF THE GOVERNMENT. MR. PRESIDENT, MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THESE $247 MILLION -- IT SEEMS LIKE A LARGE SUM -- WHICH TELLS OF THE SUCCESS OF YOUR TRIP TO THE UNITED STATES. THIS, HOWEVER, IS TO BE USED TO PAY DEBTS. DO YOU KNOW OF ANY SPECIFIC AMOUNTS YOU MAY BE RECEIVING IN THE FUTURE, OR IS IT A QUESTION OF HAVING TO WAIT THERE WITH A LITTLE PAPER BAG TO THEN HAND IT OVER TO DON RICARDO MADURO? WHAT ARE THE RESOURCE FORECASTS AND WHAT DEFINITE INVESTMENT PLANS ARE THERE FOR THESE RESOURCES? ONE MUST ESPECIALLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE IMPACT THIS WILL HAVE ON THE CENTRAL BANK CURRENCY RESERVES SINCE INFLATION CAN BE A TIME BOMB. LASTLY, I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU IF YOU.... APPARENTLY MY COLLEAGUE REGINA HAS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION BEFORE YOU END THE CONFERENCE WITH ME. THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. NO PROBLEM. I WOULD CONTINUE THIS CONFERENCE ALL NIGHT LONG, ALTHOUGH I DO NOT WISH TO KEEP THE HOUSEWIVES FROM THEIR PROGRAMS. HOWEVER, EVERYTHING HAS A TIME FRAME AND OUR INTEREST IS THAT ALL REPORTERS HERE TONIGHT SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF TAKING PART IN THIS NEWS CONFERENCE. GETTING BACK TO YOUR QUESTION, THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THE ARMED FORCES WAS ESTABLISHED THIS WAY: THE 1989 BUDGET APPROVED BY CONGRESS WAS 150 MILLION LEMPIRAS. PERHAPS I DID NOT MAKE MYSELF CLEAR. I WAS REFERRING TO THE FUNDS THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE AVAILABLE ONCE LOANS WERE PAID OFF WITH THESE STOPGAP LOANS. YOU ARE RIGHT. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE STOPGAP FINANCING FOR $247 MILLION. THIS STOPGAP LOAN OPENS THE PATH SO THAT FRIENDLY COUNTRIES AND BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL FINANCIAL ORGANIZATIONS CAN RESUME THEIR LOANS TO THE COUNTRY. THESE FUNDS WILL GIVE US THE RIGHT TO DRAW ON SPECIAL IMF ACCOUNTS, FUNDS FROM SPECIAL WORLD BANK PROGRAMS SUCH AS SAL-1 AND SAL-2, OR FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN WITHHELD FROM JAPAN AND GERMANY. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THESE FUNDS IS ENOUGH TO PAY THE $247 MILLION STOPGAP LOAN IN FULL AND STILL HAVE SOME CASH LEFT OVER FOR SOME OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS THAT MAY GENERATE FUNDS FOR THE COUNTRY. THE PRECISE AMOUNTS WILL BE GIVEN BY THE CENTRAL BANK PRESIDENT; HOWEVER, TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS TO BE RECEIVED WILL BE NO LESS THAN THE AMOUNT BEING LOANED, PLUS SOME SURPLUSES FROM INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND FRIENDLY COUNTRIES, WHICH HAVE WITHHELD THEIR LOANS OR DONATIONS BECAUSE OF HONDURAS' INELIGIBILITY WITH THE IMF.
DEV-MUC3-1248	BOGOTA, 29 APR 90 -- ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, WHO HAD BEEN THE NUMBER TWO MAN IN THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT , WAS NOMINATED TODAY AS THE NEW PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TO REPLACE CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ, WHO WAS MURDERED ON 26 APRIL. NAVARRO WOLFF, WHO IS A FORMER GUERRILLA LIKE THE SLAIN LEADER, RECEIVED THE NOMINATION WHEN PIZARRO'S FUNERAL PROCESSION STOPPED AT THE HOME OF LIBERATOR SIMON BOLIVAR IN BOGOTA. IN A SPEECH MADE TO THE THOUSANDS AT THE FUNERAL, NAVARRO ACCEPTED THE NOMINATION AND SAID THAT HE WAS PICKING UP THE BANNERS OF THE SLAIN LEFTIST LEADER.
DEV-MUC3-1249	BOGOTA, 29 APR 90 -- FOLLOWING THE FUNERAL OF M-19 PRESIDENT CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ, THE GROUP'S NEW PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF SAID THAT HIS GROUP WILL CONTINUE THE STRUGGLE FOR PEACE. THE M-19, THE ORGANIZATION THAT SIGNED A PEACE AGREEMENT WITH PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S GOVERNMENT ON 8 MARCH AND LAID DOWN ITS WEAPONS ON 9 MARCH TO BECOME A POLITICAL PARTY, SAID THAT IT WILL NOT PICK UP ITS WEAPONS AGAIN AS A RESULT OF THE MURDER OF THE 39-YEAR-OLD PIZARRO. PIZARRO WAS BURIED YESTERDAY. ONLY 50 DAYS AFTER REJOINING CIVILIAN LIFE FOLLOWING MORE THAN 20 YEARS OF ARMED STRUGGLE, PIZARRO BECAME A SYMBOL FOR PEACE, ALTHOUGH, ACCORDING TO COMMENTATORS, WITH HIS DEATH HIS KILLERS ARE ATTEMPTING TO DESTABILIZE THE COUNTRY. WHEN ACCEPTING THE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION, ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, A 42-YEAR-OLD ENGINEER, FORMER DEAN OF A UNIVERSITY, REBEL, AND THE OLDEST OF SEVEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS, SAID THAT HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT FOR THAT COLOMBIA WHICH WANTS DEMOCRACY AND WISHES TO LIVE IN PEACE. THE NEW M-19 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WAS FORCED TO SPEAK AND ACCEPT THE NOMINATION WHEN PIZARRO'S FUNERAL PROCESSION MADE A STOP AT THE HOME OF THE LIBERATOR SIMON BOLIVAR. HE SAID THAT THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE MUST UNITE TO MAKE HARMONY POSSIBLE, AND HE URGED EVERYONE TO CONTRIBUTE TO A FUTURE OF PEACE, A BETTER FUTURE FOR COMING GENERATIONS. SPEAKING BEFORE PIZARRO'S CASKET, WHICH WAS DRAPED WITH THE COLOMBIAN FLAG, NAVARRO, WHO IN 1985 SURVIVED AN ATTACK DURING WHICH HE LOST A LEG, SWORE TO FIGHT FOR PEACE AS PIZARRO HAD DONE. THE THOUSANDS OF PERSONS WHO ATTENDED SATURDAY'S FUNERAL CARRIED PLACARDS WITH SLOGANS THAT READ: COMMANDER PIZARRO, WE CONTINUE FORWARD, AND COMRADE PIZARRO, WE ARE FOR PEACE, WE SWEAR. OTHERS WHO JOINED THE THOUSANDS OF VOICES ASKING NAVARRO TO ACCEPT THE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION BROKE THE SILENCE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS TO CHANT: PIZARRO PRESENT, NAVARRO PRESIDENT. PIZARRO'S MOTHER MARGOT DE PIZARRO, ALONG WITH HIS LADY FRIEND LAURA, SPOKE AT THE GRAVE SITE AND ASKED THE CROWD TO FIGHT FOR PEACE AS HE HAD ALWAYS DONE. AT THE CEMETERY THE NEW PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AGAIN ADDRESSED THE CROWD, WHO HAD FOLLOWED THE MORE THAN SEVEN-HOUR-LONG FUNERAL PROCESSION FROM THE CATHEDRAL TO SIMON BOLIVAR'S HOME AND THEN TO THE CEMETERY. HE SAID: TOGETHER WITH ALL THE GOOD COLOMBIANS, WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF HISTORY. HE ADDED THAT PIZARRO'S MURDER WAS USELESS BECAUSE THE M-19 WILL CONTINUE ITS STRUGGLE FOR PEACE. PIZARRO'S FUNERAL WAS HELD IN BOGOTA. THE AUTHORITIES PRAISED THE FACT THAT NO INCIDENTS OR PUBLIC DISORDERS DEVELOPED DURING THE FUNERAL. THE M-19 LEADERS HAD ASKED THE PEOPLE TO REMAIN CALM. THE NEW COLOMBIAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IS THE SIXTH COMMANDER M-19 HAS HAD, THE SECOND SINCE THE REBEL GROUP ENTERED ITS NEW PHASE TO BECOME A POLITICAL PARTY. ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF WILL BE RUNNING AGAINST 12 OTHER CANDIDATES IN THE ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR 27 MAY.
DEV-MUC3-1250	BUENOS AIRES, 29 APR 90 -- EVERYBODY IS PRAISING AND JUSTIFYING THE ARGENTINE CONDOR II PROJECT -- THE ONLY ONE WE HAD -- NOW THAT IT HAS OFFICIALLY DIED, HOWEVER, A MORE TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE DEFUNCT PROJECT WILL REVEAL THE GAP LEFT BY OUR FLIMSY SPACE PROJECT. ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF FUEL USED, MISSILES ARE CLASSIFIED AS SOLID, LIQUID, AND CRYOGENIC-FUELED MISSILES. THE SOLID-FUELED MISSILES CARRY THEIR FUEL AND THE COMBURENT ON A STICKY ROD, THE COMBUSTION OF WHICH CANNOT BE REGULATED. THE CAKE BURNS COMPLETELY ONCE THE COMBUSTION STARTS. THEREFORE, SOLID-FUELED MISSILES ARE DIFFICULT TO CONTROL ALTHOUGH THEY ARE MUCH SIMPLER AND CHEAPER. MOREOVER, THEY PUT UP WITH ROUGH HANDLING AND CAN BE EASILY FIRED. THE MILITARY PREFER THIS TYPE FOR MANUFACTURING SHORT-RANGE MISSILES. THE LIQUID-FUELED MISSILES CARRY THE FUEL AND THE COMBURENT IN COMPLETELY SEPARATE TANKS. THE TWO ELEMENTS MEET IN A COMBUSTION CHAMBER WHERE THEY IGNITE AFTER TRAVELLING THROUGH PIPES. VALVES MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO REGULATE THE POWER OF THE ENGINE. GROUND PERSONNEL ARE ABLE TO STOP THE ENGINE AND RESTART IT IN FULL FLIGHT, IN SHORT, TO CONTROL THE MISSILE AS THEY WISH THROUGH RADIO MESSAGES. THE CRYOGENIC-FUELED MISSILES WERE DEVELOPED DURING THE 70'S AND 80'S. THEY CARRY HYDROGEN AND LIQUID GAS WHICH ARE LIGHTER THAN ANY OTHER PROPELLANT ELEMENT BUT WHICH ARE VERY EXPENSIVE TO REFRIGERATE AND TO ISOLATE. THIS TECHNOLOGY MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO BUILD VERY FAST VEHICLES BECAUSE OF THEIR POWER TO WEIGHT RATIO. THEY ARE USED TO PLACE HUGE COMMUNICATION SATELLITES IN SPACE SOME 36,000 KM ABOVE THE EQUATOR, OR TO ATTACK A CITY FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD. LIQUID-FUELED MISSILES REPRESENT THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED DURING THE 50'S AND 60'S AND, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, EXPLAINS SOVIET LEADERSHIP IN SPACE RESEARCH. THESE OLD, HEAVY, CUMBERSOME, AND UNBREAKABLE MISSILES DO NOT HAVE FRAGILE EQUIPMENT AND MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO PLACE CARGO INTO OUTER SPACE AT A REASONABLE COST. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE LARGE FAMILY OF U.S. AND EUROPEAN CRYOGENIC- FUELED MISSILES CONTINUE AT AN EXPERIMENTAL STAGE AND ARE UNPREDICTABLE . MOREOVER, THEY ARE INCREDIBLY COSTLY. TOO POOR TO EVEN THINK OF DEVELOPING LIQUID-FUELED MISSILES, BRAZIL AND ARGENTINA HAVE TRIED TO PLACE SOLID-FUELED VEHICLES INTO ORBIT FOR DECADES. THIS IS NOT ALL THAT EASY BECAUSE THESE MISSILES ARE REALLY LITTLE MORE THAN FLYING RODS , BUT THE CASTOR, WHICH WAS DEVELOPED BY ARGENTINA IN 1978, THE SONDA IV DEVELOPED BY BRAZIL, AND THE JAPANESE LAUNCHING DEVICES DEVELOPED BY ISAS HAVE PROVED TO BE REASONABLY MANAGEABLE BEASTS. THE CASTOR REPRESENTED THE PHASE PREVIOUS TO DESIGNING A SPACESHIP AND THIS MUST BE THE REASON WHY IT MYSTERIOUSLY DIED IN 1978 AFTER A SERIES OF INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL TESTS AND AFTER HAVING ALLOWED US TO REACH AN AGREEMENT FOR A "JOINT-VENTURE" WITH THE FRG TO STUDY THE ATMOSPHERE. THE ABSENCE OF MISTAKES BY A DEBTOR COUNTRY MAY BE FATAL. WHEN ARGENTINA ONCE AGAIN STARTED TO DISCREETLY THINK ABOUT OUTER SPACE , IT ALREADY HAD ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE TO CONSIDER LARGER PROJECTS. IN FACT, WITH ITS ONE METER DIAMETER TUBE, THE CONDOR COULD PLACE A 200 KG CARGO IN A LOW POLAR ORBIT OF ONLY 200 KM. THIS PROJECT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED ARGENTINA TO HAVE ONE OR MORE PAIRS OF EYES IN SPACE SO THAT COULD ASSESS ITS NATURAL RESOURCES, PREDICT THE WATER FLOW OF RIVERS ON WHICH HYDROELECTRIC DAMS COULD BE BUILT, DETERMINE WHERE IT COULD FIND OIL AND URANIUM, AND CHEAPLY STOP ILLEGAL FISHING ON THE CONTINENTAL PLATFORM. THIS POSSIBILITY COULD NOT BE ACCEPTED BY SOME PEOPLE. BRAZIL, WHICH IS LESS HARD UP, IS ABOUT TO PROGRESS FROM THE SONDA IV TO THE SONDA V AND HAS OPENLY INVITED US TO JOINTLY DEVELOP THE SPACESHIP. WHAT WILL ARGENTINA ANSWER? "WE WILL"? OR WILL IT HAVE A CHAUVINIST ATTITUDE? WHAT A PITY IT DID NOT ADOPT THAT ATTITUDE NOW THAT IT IS LETTING THE CONDOR PROJECT DIE IN ITS FIRST STAGE -- IT WAS NEVER TESTED -- WHEN THE PRESSURE IS NOT AS GREAT AS IT HAS BEEN. WORST OF IT ALL IS THAT IT IS NOT RECEIVING ANYTHING IN EXCHANGE. VERY WELL THEN, IT IS ACCEPTED, THE CONDOR WILL GO NO FURTHER. WHAT IS LEFT? VERY LITTLE. SHOULD WE DEVELOP SATELLITES EXCLUSIVELY FOR SPACE RESEARCH TO DISCOVER THE SECRETS OF THE SUN, OR STUDY THE COSMIC EXPLOSIONS OF X-RAYS. THESE ISSUES, IF UNAFFECTED BY ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL FACTORS, DO NOT DISTURB ANYBODY. THE NASA IS QUITE WILLING TO GIVE US ROOM, FREE OF CHARGE, ON THEIR ROCKETS FOR THIS TYPE OF SATELLITES. THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY THAT WE WILL GAIN EITHER MONEY OR SPACE SOVEREIGNTY. THERE IS NO NEED TO POINT OUT THAT ANY SIMILARITY BETWEEN THIS POSSIBILITY AND AN INDEPENDENT SPACE RESEARCH PROGRAM, SUCH AS BRAZIL'S, IS MERE COINCIDENCE. IN THE 80'S ARGENTINA ALLOWED ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM, WHICH AT THAT TIME WAS THE MOST ADVANCED IN THE THIRD WORLD, TO BE HINDERED. NOW IT IS ALLOWING ITS WINGS TO BE CLIPPED AND, WITH A STUPID SMILE, IS YIELDING EVERY ATTEMPT TO ACHIEVE SOVEREIGNTY IN SPACE. EACH ATTEMPT TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY IS LABELLED ARMS ESCALATION BY THOSE CHAMPIONS OF PEACE, OUR CREDITORS. IT IS QUITE TRUE, THE CONDOR II MAY BE A MISSILE, AS A CARGO AIRCRAFT MAY DROP BOMBS AND A TRUCK MAY BE EQUIPPED WITH ARTILLERY FOR WAR. DOES THIS MEAN THAT ARGENTINA MUST STOP MANUFACTURING ALL TYPE OF VEHICLES? THIS QUESTION IS NOT POINTLESS IN A COUNTRY THAT REFUSES TO MAKE ANY PROGRESS.
DEV-MUC3-1251	QUITO, 30 APR 90 -- ECUADORAN SOCIAL COMMUNICATIONS SECRETARY PEDRO SAAD ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT A GROUP OF COLOMBIANS DRESSED AS MILITARY MEN ON 28 APRIL KIDNAPPED U.S. CITIZEN SCOTT HEYNDAL, KILLED A COLOMBIAN, AND WOUNDED AN ECUADOREAN. HEYNDAL AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE TRAVELING ABOARD A SMALL BOAT ON THE SAN MIGUEL RIVER IN THE AMAZON REGION WHEN THEY WERE ATTACKED WITH AUTOMATIC WEAPONS BY THE COLOMBIANS FROM A LARGER VESSEL.
DEV-MUC3-1252	NO CITY, NO DATE -- THE ARMY, SEINELDIN BELIEVES, IS DIVIDED INTO ''NATIONALIST'' AND ''ADMINISTRATIVE'' FACTIONS, AND WARNS HE ''CAN'T PREDICT WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN THEY CLASH.'' IF A SOLUTION IS NOT FOUND SOON, ''LIBERALISM OR THE LEFT IS GOING TO MAKE HEADWAY AND ENCIRCLE US, AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO ORGANIZE OURSELVES TO DEFEND THE INSTITUTIONS,'' SOMOS OF 14 FEBRUARY REPORTS. THE PRESS ALSO REPORTS SEINELDIN'S COMMENTS REGARDING THE UNITED STATES. DURING HIS VISIT TO MENDOZA, FOR INSTANCE, HE ADVOCATED A ''CIVILIAN-MILITARY ALLIANCE TO DEFEAT THE TWO IMPERIALISMS, REPRESENTED BY THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION,'' ACCORDING TO LA NACION OF 21 MARCH. SOMOS OF 14 FEBRUARY QUOTES SEINELDIN AS STATING THAT ''THE WORLD IS DIVIDED, AND WHAT WAS THE THIRD WORLD HAS BEEN INFILTRATED BY IMPERIALISM AND COMMUNISM. WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN HOW THE UNITED STATES BLOCKADED VENEZUELA AND IS NOW TRYING TO DO THE SAME WITH MEXICO, WHERE IT HAS INSTALLED A SINGLE PARTY. DRUG TRAFFICKING WILL BE GIVEN AS AN EXCUSE FOR INVADING IT.'' LEVEL OF POPULAR SUPPORT LA PRENSA OF 13 MARCH ANALYZES A SURVEY ON SEINELDIN'S POPULARITY CONDUCTED BY THE DEMOSKOPIA INSTITUTE FOR MARKET RESEARCH AND POLITICAL STUDIES. ACCORDING TO THE STUDY, ''SEINELDIN IS BETTER KNOWN THAN MANY POLITICIANS'' AND CABINET MEMBERS, SINCE 91 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION KNOWS OR HAS HEARD ABOUT HIM. THE SURVEY SHOWS 20 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION APPROVES OF HIM, 40 PERCENT DISAPPROVES, WHILE 21 PERCENT IS UNDECIDED. THE DEMOSKOPIA STUDY ALSO POINTS OUT THAT, ALTHOUGH SEINELDIN MAY HAVE ''HALF OF PUBLIC OPINION AGAINST HIM,'' THERE IS ''A LARGE PERCENTAGE THAT DOES NOT YET HAVE A DEFINITE OPINION,'' AND THAT ''DEPENDING ON SEINELDIN'S POLITICAL SKILL AND ON HOW MUCH THE COUNTRY'S SITUATION CONTINUES TO DETERIORATE,' HE COULD INCREASE HIS FOLLOWING, PARTICULARLY FROM AMONG THE UNDECIDED. ACCORDING TO AN OPINION POLL CONDUCTED IN LATE FEBRUARY BY THE UNION STUDY CENTER FOR THE NEW MAJORITY AND REPORTED IN LA NACION OF 23 MARCH, SEINELDIN IS SEEN IN A MORE POSITIVE LIGHT OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL AND GREATER BUENOS AIRES, AMONG PEOPLE WITH LOWER LEVELS OF EDUCATION, AND AMONG SUPPORTERS OF THE RULING JUSTICIALIST PARTY. MORE SPECIFIALLY:. GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION--IN THE CITY OF BUENOS AIRES, SEINELDIN RECEIVED 14 PERCENT FAVORABLE AND 40 PERCENT NEGATIVE RATINGS; IN GREATER BUENOS AIRES, 26 AND 32 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY; AND IN THE NORTHWEST REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY, 41 PERCENT FAVORABLE VERSUS 30 PERCENT UNFAVORABLE. LEVEL OF EDUCATION--IN THE CAPITAL AND GREATER BUENOS AIRES, SEINELDIN HAS A 19 PERCENT APPROVAL RATING AMONG THOSE WHO COMPLETED ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, 14 PERCENT AMONG THOSE WHO COMPLETED SECONDARY SCHOOL, AND 10 PERCENT AMONG THOSE WITH COLLEGE DEGREES. POLITICAL AFFILIATION--SURVEY PARTICIPANTS WHO VOTED FOR THE RADICAL PARTY DURING THE LAST NATIONAL ELECTIONS GIVE SEINELDIN A 7 PERCENT APPROVAL RATING, THOSE WHO VOTED FOR THE UNITED LEFT GIVE HIM 8 PERCENT, AND AMONG THOSE WHO VOTED FOR THE MENEM-DUHALDE TICKET HIS APPROVAL RATE IS 25 PERCENT. MILITARY CONCERNS MILITARY PERSONNEL ARE CONCERNED ABOUT LOW SALARIES AND THE SHARP DECREASE IN PURCHASING POWER, ACCORDING TO AN 11 MARCH ARTICLE IN LA PRENSA. THEIR DISSATISFACTION, WHICH WAS PUBLICIZED IN A FLIER WHICH APPEARED IN SEVERAL PROVINCIAL GARRISONS, WAS DISCUSSED DURING SEINELDIN'S MEETING WITH COMMISSIONED AND NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS IN SANTA FE, ACCORDING TO SOMOS OF 14 FEBRUARY. THE POSSIBILITY OF A SOCIAL EXPLOSION AND THE RELUCTANCE OF THE ''CARAPINTADAS'' TO INTERVENE WERE DISCUSSED DURING SEINELDIN'S MEETINGS IN ROSARIO, ACCORDING TO THE 14 FEBRUARY ISSUE OF SOMOS. ''WE CANNOT ENGAGE IN REPRESSION, AND THAT COULD CAUSE A LOT OF PROBLEMS FOR THE SECURITY FORCES,'' AN ''AUTHORIZED SPOKEMAN'' REPORTEDLY CONFIDED. IF THE ECONOMY DETERIORATES AND SOCIAL UNREST ENSUES, ''UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE WILL THE ARMED FORCES BE INCLINED TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE POLICE FORCES IN GUARDING SUPERMARKETS OR ANY PLACE NOT CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AS 'VITAL TO THE NATION,'' ACCORDING TO THE 11 MARCH ISSUE OF LA PRENSA.
DEV-MUC3-1253	SAN SALVADOR, 25 APR 90 -- THE HIGH COMMAND OF THE ARMED FORCES IS ANALYZING NEWS REPORTS ABOUT COLONEL SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ, PRESIDENT OF AN AUTONOMOUS INSTITUTION, HAVING SAID THAT THE OFFICER INVOLVED IN THE DEATH OF SIX JESUITS AND THEIR TWO MAIDS "FOLLOWED ORDERS FROM ABOVE". OCHOA MADE THOSE COMMENTS ON A U.S. TELEVISION NEWSCAST AT A TIME WHEN SEVERAL MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WANT TO CUT AID TO EL SALVADOR AND ARE CONDUCTING THEIR OWN INVESTIGATIONS OF THE CASE. THE RESULTS OF THEIR INVESTIGATION WILL BE KNOWN NEXT WEEK. DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL RAFAEL HUMBERTO LARIOS CONFIRMED ON THE MORNING OF 24 APRIL THAT THE HIGH COMMAND IS ANALYZING OCHOA'S DECLARATIONS AND STRESSED THAT VERSIONS SUCH AS THE ONE ATTRIBUTED TO THE OFFICIAL USUALLY COME FROM "INTERESTED PARTIES." LARIOS, QUESTIONED WHEN HE BID FAREWELL TO PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, WHO LEFT FOR NICARAGUA ON 24 APRIL, SAID THAT "THE CASE IS IN THE COURTS AND ALL THOSE WHO HAVE NEW EVIDENCE MAY APPROACH THEM TO CONTRIBUTE WHAT THEY HAVE SO THAT IT MAY BE SOLVED." "BOTH THE ARMY AND THE GOVERNMENT WANT EVERYTHING TO BE CLARIFIED WITHIN A FAIR AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK," HE SAID. ARMY OFFICERS WHO ASKED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS SAID ON 24 APRIL THAT "THE COMMENTS MADE BY OCHOA, CONTROVERSIAL POLITICIAN AND SOLDIER KNOWN FOR HIS FREQUENT OUTBURSTS, HAVE NO BASIS BECAUSE HE HAS NO ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL ARMED FORCES SOURCES DUE TO HIS RETIRED STATUS." HOWEVER, THE INFORMERS HAVE SAID THAT "WHAT OCHOA SAID NOT ONLY DAMAGES THE ARMY'S IMAGE, BUT THAT OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WHILE IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE DEFAMATION CAMPAIGN BEING CARRIED OUT ABROAD BY INTERESTED PARTIES, AMONG THEM, THE LEADERS OF THE FMLN-FDR ." THEY ADDED THAT OCHOA'S DECLARATION, "MADE WITHOUT PRESENTING ANY PROOF, ENDANGERS THE MILITARY AID THAT THE UNITED STATES OFFERS TO EL SALVADOR AND, AT THE SAME TIME, FAVORS THE INTERNATIONALIST LEFT WHICH INTENDS TO PLAY THE LAST CARD IT HAS TO ASSAULT POWER IN THIS COUNTRY." THE POLITICIANS' IMMEDIATE REACTION TO OCHOA PEREZ' COMMENTS WAS TO DEMAND THAT HE BE MORE SPECIFIC IN HIS ACCUSATION. PDC LEADER EDUARDO COLINDRES SAID IN A PRESS CONFERENCE THAT "OCHOA PEREZ HAS THE MORAL OBLIGATION OF NAMING" THOSE OF HIS COMRADES-IN-ARMS HE IMPLICATES IN THE DEATH OF THE JESUITS, SINCE THE VERSION HE GAVE TO THE TELEVISION PROGRAM THAT INTERVIEWED HIM IS VAGUE. THE POLITICIAN SAID: "IF HE KNOWS SOMETHING, IT IS TIME THAT HE BRING IT OUT INTO A PUBLIC LIGHT SO THAT JUSTICE AUTHORITIES MAY TAKE THE APPROPRIATE PATHS." MEANWHILE, IN MANAGUA, SPANISH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO ATTENDED VIOLETA CHAMORRO'S INAUGURATION SAID THAT THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED BY THE SLUGGISH MANNER IN WHICH THE INVESTIGATIONS OF THE JESUITS' CASE ARE APPARENTLY BEING CARRIED OUT. THEY SAID THAT THEY MIGHT MENTION THE TOPIC DURING THE MEETINGS THEY WILL HOLD WITH PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IN NICARAGUA. REPORTS FROM WASHINGTON D.C. QUOTE THE LEFTIST LEADER OF THE FDR, GUILLERMO MANUEL UNGO, AS SAYING THAT "HIS EFFORTS IN THE AMERICAN CAPITAL TO EXPOSE THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR, ARE A SUCCESS." THE SOURCES SAID THAT UNGO AND HIS MARXIST-LENINIST ALLIES WANT THE U.S. SENATE TO STOP GIVING MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR. THE SOURCES ALSO SAID THAT UNGO DISCREDITS THE ARMY AND THE GOVERNMENT AND FAVORS THE LEGAL RECOGNITION OF THE REBEL GROUPS OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY. "EVERYTHING SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT THE LEFTIST INTERNATIONALISTS HAVE UNLEASHED A NEW DISINFORMATION OFFENSIVE AGAINST EL SALVADOR WITH THE AID OF BAD SALVADORANS," THE SOURCES SAID. REFERRING TO OTHER COMMUNIST MOVES IN THE COUNTRY, GENERAL LARIOS SAID THAT THE LOCAL LEFTISTS ARE PREPARING TO STAGE TERRORIST ACTIONS AND STREET DISTURBANCES OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS UNDER THE PRETEXT OF COMMEMORATING LABOR DAY. LARIOS URGED THE FMLN-FDR TERRORISTS TO REFRAIN FROM PERPETRATING VIOLENT ACTIONS, THUS CREATING AN ADEQUATE CLIMATE FOR THE "DIALOGUE" ANNOUNCED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO BE HELD ON 3 MAY. "OTHERWISE, THE TERRORISTS WOULD BE VIOLATING THE COMMITMENTS THEY MADE," LARIOS POINTED OUT. IN ADDITION, IT HAS BEEN REPORTED FROM COSTA RICA THAT FMLN-FDR LEADERS HAVE SAID THAT THEY HAVE PREPARED ANOTHER OFFENSIVE FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT HAS ELICITED STRONG REJECTION BY VARIOUS SECTORS.
DEV-MUC3-1254	SAN SALVADOR, 1 MAY 90 -- FOLLOWING A MEETING OF THE GENERAL STAFF WITH ALL THE BRIGADE AND DETACHMENT COMMANDERS, THE ARMED FORCES TODAY ISSUED A PUBLIC COMMUNIQUE DESCRIBING THE RECENT STATEMENTS BY COLONEL SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ AS IRRESPONSIBLE AND TENDENTIOUS. IN PARTS, THE COMMUNIQUE POINTED OUT THAT: 1. WE EMPHATICALLY AND CATEGORICALLY REJECT THE RECENT STATEMENTS BY DISCHARGED COL. SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ PUBLISHED IN THE LOCAL AND FOREIGN MEDIA. THESE STATEMENTS ARE IRRESPONSIBLE AND TENDENTIOUS AND SEEK TO CREATE CONFUSION AND DISTRUST IN THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITIES BY TRYING TO INVOLVE THE MEMBERS OF THE HIGH COMMAND IN THE REGRETTABLE CASE OF THE DEATH OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS AND THEIR WORKERS. 2. WE DEMAND THAT BOTH COL. OCHOA PEREZ, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER PERSON HAVING ANY INFORMATION THAT COULD LEAD TO CLARIFYING THIS CASE OR ANY OTHER CASE, PRESENT IT TO THE CORRESPONDING TRIBUNALS AND NOT TRY TO OBTAIN POLITICAL PROFIT BASED ON ALLEGED STATEMENTS THAT ARE ADDED ON TO THE CAMPAIGN OF DISINFORMATION THAT IS BEING CARRIED OUT IN A SYSTEMATIC MANNER BY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL MARXIST-LENINIST TERRORISTS. 3. WE CONDEMN SUCH IRRESPONSIBLE STATEMENTS AS THEY SEEK TO UNDERMINE THE INSTITUTIONALITY OF THE STATE, AND ONLY FAVOR THE DARK AND NEFARIOUS INTERESTS OF THE ENEMIES OF DEMOCRACY. IN CONCLUDING, THE ARMED FORCES COMMUNIQUE REAFFIRMS ITS COMMITMENT TO THE INSTITUTIONALITY OF THE COUNTRY AND THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND POINTED OUT THAT THE INSTITUTION IS RULED BY SOLID PROFESSIONAL, MORAL, AND ETHICAL PRINCIPLES. WITH THIS STATEMENT, ALL THE COMMANDERS GIVE THEIR UNCONDITIONAL VOTE OF CONFIDENCE TO THE MILITARY HIGH COMMAND OF THE ARMED FORCES.
DEV-MUC3-1255	SAN SALVADOR, 1 MAY 90 -- SALVADORAN GUERRILLA GROUPS LAUNCHED SEVERAL ATTACKS ON SEVERAL POINTS OF THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL TONIGHT CAUSING BLACKOUTS AND AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF DEAD, IN ADDITION TO CAUSING PANIC AMONG THE CITIZENRY. MILITARY SPOKESMEN REPORTED THAT THE GUERRILLA ATTACKS BEGAN AT 2130 AND WERE AIMED AT THE PUBLIC SECURITY FORCES' ACADEMY, LOCATED IN THE SOUTHERN SECTOR OF THE CAPITAL, AND MILITARY POSITIONS IN THE WEALTHY ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD, WHERE THE SHERATON HOTEL IS LOCATED. A HEAVY BARRAGE OF RIFLE FIRE AND EXPLOSIONS WERE HEARD FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE HOUR IN THE SAN RAMON AREA, LOCATED IN THE NORTHWESTERN SECTOR OF SAN SALVADOR, WHILE ONE AIR FORCE HELICOPTER OVERFLEW THE CITY. THERE WERE ALSO REPORTS OF ATTACKS ON A MILITARY POST AT THE CENTRAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL AND OTHER POSITIONS ON THE NORTHWESTERN OUTSKIRTS OF THE CAPITAL. SIMULTANEOUSLY, URBAN GUERRILLA COMMANDOS ATTACKED THE CIVIL DEFENSE GROUP IN THE COSTA RICA NEIGHBORHOOD OF SOUTHERN SAN SALVADOR. SEVERAL ELECTRIC POLES WERE BROUGHT DOWN IN VARIOUS SECTORS OF THE CITY, CAUSING BLACKOUTS OVER LARGE AREAS. THERE ARE STILL NO OFFICIAL REPORTS ON THE NUMBER OF DEAD AND WOUNDED. EARLY THIS MORNING, GUERRILLA COLUMNS ATTACKED THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE'S POSITIONS IN MARIONA, LOCATED ON THE NORTHERN OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR, KILLING ONE SOLDIER AND WOUNDING ANOTHER.
DEV-MUC3-1256	SAN SALVADOR, 2 MAY 90 -- HE ARMED FORCES HAVE REPORTED THAT A GROUP OF REBELS BELONGING TO THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT THIS MORNING STAGED AN ARMED ATTACK ON THE RESIDENCE OF SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI. THE PRESIDENT WAS UNHARMED, BUT TWO POLICEMEN WERE KILLED AND AN ARMY CAPTAIN WAS WOUNDED IN THE CONTRONTATION, WHICH TOOK PLACE IN THE EXCLUSIVE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD IN THE NORTHWESTERN PART OF THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL, ACCORDING TO MILITARY SPOKESMAN MAURICIO CHAVEZ CACERES.
DEV-MUC3-1257	MEXICO CITY , 2 MAY 90 -- SAN SALVADOR, 2 MAY -- INTENSE CLASHES WERE HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WITHIN THE LAST FEW HOURS. THIS IS A NEW MILITARY MANEUVER BY THE GUERILLAS TO PRESSURE THE GOVERNMENT INTO RENEWING THE DIALOGUE. AT LEAST 10 SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AS A RESULT OF THE HARASSMENT AND ATTACKS BY THE FMLN IN SEVEN OF THE COUNTRY'S 14 DEPARTMENTS. ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SOURCES, THE ATTACKS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY SABOTAGE TO THE ELECTRIC SERVICE SYSTEM. THE ATTACKS STARTED AT 2030 ON 2 MAY AND CONTINUED UNTIL LATE THIS MORNING. THE NATIONAL ENERGY ENTERPRISE REPORTED THAT ELECTRIC POWER WILL BE RATIONED FOR AT LEAST FOUR HOURS DURING THIS MORNING IN MOST OF THE CAPITAL AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. MEANWHILE, FMLN SPOKESMEN MADE A TELEPHONE CALL TO A LOCAL RADIO STATION REPORTING THAT THE MILITARY MANEUVER UNLEASHED ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL IS AIMED AT PRESSURING THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT TO RENEW THE DIALOGUE. TALKS BETWEEN THE FNLM AND THE GOVERNMENT ARE SCHEDULED TO START DURING THE FIRST PART OF THIS MONTH, ACCORDING TO UN SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR, WHO IS ACTING AS A MEDIATOR. PEREZ DE CUELLAR'S PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE, ALVARO DE SOTO, TODAY WILL DELIVER TO PRESIDENT CRISTINAI AN FMLN PROPOSAL TO PROMOTE THE DIALOGUE.
DEV-MUC3-1258	SAN SALVADOR, 2 MAY 90 -- COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FMLN: WE ANNOUNCE THAT BETWEEN THE NIGHT OF 1 MAY AND THE EARLY MORNING OF 2 MAY, OUR FORCES CONDUCTED SEVERAL MILITARY OPERATIONS IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER CITIES OF THE COUNTRY IN RESPONSE TO: 1. THE PREVAILING TOTAL IMPUNITY OF MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES IN VIOLATING HUMAN RIGHTS, AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE STANDSTILL REACHED IN THE TRIAL, THE EVIDENT COVER UP OF THE MASTERMINDS OF THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE RELEASE OF THE GROUP OF KIDNAPPERS, AND THE RECENT MURDER OF A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR AND A COOPERATIVE LEADER. 2. THE MILITARY OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE ARMED FORCES IN RURAL AREAS WITH INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS AND ARRESTS OF CIVILIANS. 3. THE ARROGANT AND BOASTFUL ATTITUDE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE MILITARY BECAUSE OF AN ALLEGED WEAKNESS SHOWN BY THE FMLN, WHICH OBSTRUCTS THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS. 4. THE UNPOPULAR ECONOMIC MEASURES AND THE PLANS TO CARRY OUT THE BIGGEST ECONOMIC FRAUD AND ACT OF CORRUPTION IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY WITH THE PRIVATIZATION OF BANKS. WE BELIEVE THAT: 1. THE U.S. CONGRESSIONAL PLAN TO CUT ONLY 50 PERCENT OF THE MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT ENOUGH. ANY ASSISTANCE TO TERRORIST ARMED FORCES ONLY CONTRIBUTES TO WAR AND REDUCES THE POSSIBILITY FOR A SHORT-TERM CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT. 2. AS LONG AS THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES FOR THE ENTIRE SOCIETY, AS LONG AS CRIMES COMMITTED BY THE MILITARY GO UNPUNISHED, AND AS LONG AS REPRESSION DOES NOT STOP, WAR WILL CONTINUE. FINALLY WE REITERATE OUR WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS. CONSEQUENTLY, WE HAVE ALREADY PRESENTED OUR POSITIONS TO THE GOVERNMENT AND ARE AWAITING ITS REPLY SO THAT WE CAN START HOLDING THE NEGOTIATIONS. GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FMLN EL SALVADOR, 2 MAY 1990
DEV-MUC3-1259	MEXICO CITY , 2 MAY 90 -- THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT TODAY ACCUSED THE COLOMBIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES OF ASSASSINATING M-19 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CARLOS PIZARRO. "WE ATTRIBUTE PIZARRO'S DEATH TO THE COLOMBIAN SECURITY SERVICES," SAID M-19 DIRECTORATE MEMBER RAFAEL VERGARA DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE HELD IN MEXICO CITY. THE POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC COMMISSION OF THE FORMER REBEL GROUP TURNED POLITICAL PARTY HAS PROPOSED THE CREATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL GROUP TO PERMANENTLY PROTECT THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES' LIVES. MIGUEL MARIN, ALSO A MEMBER OF THE M-19'S DIRECTORATE, POINTED OUT THE NEED FOR VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO DESIGNATE POLITICAL PERSONALITIES WHO WOULD ACCOMPANY EACH OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ON THEIR CAMPAIGNS. "WE INTEND TO CHECK THE TRIGGERS OF THE COLOMBIAN OLIGARCHY, WHO ARE TO BLAME FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF FOUR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES IN THE PAST FEW YEARS," THE POLITICAL MOVEMENT'S REPRESENTATIVES SAID. THEY DENIED THAT THE M-19 IS IN FAVOR OF DRUG TRAFFICKING, BUT ADVOCATED THE LEGALIZATION OF DRUGS AND THE NONEXTRADITION OF DRUG PRODUCERS. THE M-19 MEMBERS SAID THAT THE CLARIFICATION OF THEIR TOP LEADER'S DEATH IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE CREDIBILITY OF VIRGILIO BARCO'S REGIME. THEY SAID THAT PIZARRO'S BASIC PROPOSALS TO PACIFY THE COUNTRY WILL BE TAKEN UP BY ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, WHO REPLACED PIZARRO AS THE M-19'S PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. THEY ASKED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO HELP PUT AN END TO THE ARMS TRAFFIC TO COLOMBIA, BECAUSE IN 1989 FOREIGN INVESTMENT INCREASED BY 148 PERCENT OVER THAT OF 1988. "WHAT COLOMBIA NEEDS IS TO ATTAIN PEACE WITH SOCIAL JUSTICE. FOR THIS REASON, IT IS NECESSARY TO TALK AND NEGOTIATE WITH ALL OF THE INFLUENTIAL SECTORS IN COLOMBIA, INCLUDING THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS," VERGARA AND MARIN POINTED OUT.
DEV-MUC3-1260	SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 90 -- A GROUP PURPORTEDLY REPRESENTING YOUNG SALVADORAN MILITARY OFFICERS HAS CALLED FOR A PURGE OF THE ARMED FORCES HERE, ACCUSING THEIR SUPERIORS OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE MASSACRE OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS. THE CALL CAME WEDNESDAY IN THE WAKE OF A BOLD OFFENSIVE BY LEFTIST GUERRILLAS WHO ATTACKED STRATEGIC TARGETS ACROSS THE CAPITAL, INCLUDING THE RESIDENCE OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, IN A SHOW OF FORCE BEFORE PEACE TALKS. THE STATEMENT DISTRIBUTED TO NEWS ORGANIZATIONS WAS MADE IN THE NAME OF A "COMMANDO OF YOUNG OFFICERS." IT GAVE NO NAMES BUT SAID THE GROUP WAS FORMED SECRETLY AMONG OFFICERS FED UP WITH CORRUPTION BY A SMALL GROUP OF MILITARY LEADERS. IF AUTHENTIC, THE STATEMENT WOULD MARK THE FIRST TIME SINCE A 1979 MILITARY COUP THAT A GROUP OF JUNIOR OFFICERS HAD BROKEN RANKS WITH EL SALVADOR'S MILITARY LEADERSHIP. "TODAY MORE THAN EVER, ALL THE OFFICERS WHO TRULY WANT TO SAVE OUR INSTITUTION, MUST DEMAND AND EXACT PROFOUND CHANGES AND A GENERAL PURGE AT ALL LEVELS OF THE ARMED FORCES," THE STATEMENT SAID. THE STATEMENT BLAMED A THREATENED LOSS OF U.S. MILITARY AID ON A FEW CORRUPT OFFICERS WHOM IT HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE "EXECRABLE" ASSASSINATIONS OF SIX ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIESTS DURING A REBEL OFFENSIVE IN NOVEMBER. EL SALVADOR IS SUPPOSED TO RECEIVE 315.4 MILLION DOLLARS IN U.S. AID THIS YEAR, 85 MILLION DOLLARS OF IT IN MILITARY AID. BUT THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HAS VOTED TO CUT MILITARY AID IN HALF AND U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE JAMES BAKER HAS WARNED THAT AID TO EL SALVADOR WILL DEPEND ON PROGRESS IN THE PRIESTS' CASE. THE PRIESTS, THEIR HOUSEKEEPER AND HER DAUGHTER WERE MURDERED IN THEIR RESIDENCE NOVEMBER 16 IN THE MIDST OF PROLONGED AND BLOODY GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE IN THE CITY. NINE MEMBERS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN CHARGED IN THE KILLINGS BUT MR. CRISTIANI HAS EXPRESSED DOUBTS THAT THEY WILL BE CONVICTED. "IT IS TRULY SAD AND INFURIATING FOR US THAT THE LOSS OF PRESTIGE OF THE ARMED FORCES HAS GROWN SO MUCH THAT INTERNATIONALLY WE ARE SEEN AS THE ONES TO BLAME FOR THE SITUATION OUR COUNTRY IS IN," SAID THE STATEMENT ATTRIBUTED TO THE YOUNG OFFICERS. THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT , MEANWHILE, ALSO SAID ITS ATTACKS IN SAN SALVADOR EARLY WEDNESDAY WERE TO PROTEST THE LACK OF PROGRESS IN PROSECUTING MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY FOR THE MASSACRE OF THE PRIESTS. BUT ANALYSTS SAID THE RENEWED FIGHTING APPEARED INTENDED AS A SHOW OF FORCE AHEAD OF U.N.-MEDIATED PEACE THIS MONTH, WHICH SEEK TO END A DECADE-LONG CIVIL WAR THAT HAS LEFT MORE THAN 70,000 DEAD. IN THE FIGHTING EARLY WEDNESDAY, AT LEAST SEVEN GOVERNMENT TROOPS WERE KILLED AND 18 WERE WOUNDED, AN ARMY SPOKESMAN SAID. THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES IN THE ATTACK ON THE PRESIDENTIAL RESIDENCE AND MR. CRISTIANI WAS NOT AT HOME AT THE TIME, THE SPOKESMAN SAID. THE REBELS RETREATED TO THEIR STRONGHOLD AROUND THE SAN SALVADOR VOLCANO JUST NORTH OF THE CAPITAL AFTER THE ATTACKS IN UPPER CLASS NEIGHBORHOODS. THE UNITED STATES SHARPLY CONDEMNED THE ATTACKS AND CALLED ON THE REBELS TO DEMONSTRATE THEY CAN WORK WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF EL SALVADOR TO END THE WAR. "WE CONDEMN THE OUTRAGEOUS VIOLENCE BY THE FMLN," SAID STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN RICHARD BOUCHER. "THE FMLN HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT IT CAN DESTROY THE SALVADORAN ECONOMY AND KILL SALVADORAN CITIZENS."
DEV-MUC3-1261	SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 90 -- THE YOUNG MILITARY OFFICERS WHO HAVE CIRCULATED A 5-PAGE LETTER OUTLINING THEIR VIEWS CONTEND THAT THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE NEGLECT IN CORRECTING WRONGDOINGS COMMITTED BY THE U.S. ADVISERS AND EMBASSY ARE THE MAIN PROBLEMS KEEPING THE COUNTRY MIRED IN WAR. THE OFFICERS ADD THAT THEY DO NOT TRUST THE CURRENT U.S. AMBASSADOR, WHOM THEY ACCUSE OF BETRAYING TRUTH AND JUSTICE IN THE COUNTRY IN CONNECTION WITH THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS. THE OFFICERS NOTE THE DIPLOMAT'S POSITION REGARDING THE CASE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS; HOW HE FAILED TO DENOUNCE A COLONEL WHO ACCIDENTALLY DISCOVERED THE CULPRITS AND HOW, LATELY, HE HAS WARNED THE HIGH COMMAND ABOUT SOME INFORMATION THAT WAS GOING TO BE MADE PUBLIC BY A U.S. NETWORK. THE LETTER, WHICH WAS RELEASED DURING THE LAST FEW HOURS AND IS DATED 1 MAY, EXPRESSES THE YOUNG ARMY OFFICERS SUPPORT FOR COLONEL SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ, AFTER THE DEFENSE MINISTRY, WITH THE BLESSING OF SEVERAL COMMANDERS, DECIDED TO TAKE THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF CEL TO TASK PUBLICLY. IN THEIR LETTER, THE OFFICERS STATE THAT THEY AGREE COMPLETELY WITH THE FORMER MILITARY COMMANDER REGARDING WHICH SENIOR OFFICERS GIVE ORDERS TO JUNIOR OFFICERS. WE ARE OBEDIENT AND NONCONFRONTATIONAL AND THAT IS WHY WE CONTINUE TO OBEY ORDERS FROM SUPERIORS, BUT THIS MUST STOP WHEN THE VIOLATION OF PRINCIPLES AND RIGHTS ARE INVOLVED, SAYS THE CALL FROM THE YOUNG OFFICERS TO THE PRESIDENT AND HIGH COMMAND. THE EXTENSIVE DOCUMENT DELIVERED TO THE MEDIA BY THE SELF-STYLED DOMINGO MONTERROSA LIVES MOVEMENT SAYS THAT TWO OF THE OFFICERS IT MENTIONS WERE REMOVED FROM THEIR POSTS IN THE MILITARY ORDER OF 30 APRIL. THE YOUNG OFFICERS PROVIDE NO FURTHER DETAILS BUT MAKE SOME ALLUSIONS TO MISSIONS CONDUCTED WHILE THEY DID THEIR DUTIES. THE DOCUMENT SAYS THAT SOME OF THE SENIOR OFFICERS WHO ARE OBTAINING MONEY ILLEGALLY MUST STOP AND MENTIONS THE NAMES OF FORMER MILITARY OFFICERS WHO ARE NOW LIVING AND ENJOYING THEIR WEALTH IN EXILE. THE DOCUMENT SAYS THAT THE CONTRADICTION RAISED BY THE ABOVE IS THE LUCK OF SOME GENTLEMEN OFFICERS WHO, AT THE END OF THEIR SERVICE, LIVE ABROAD AND ENJOY THEIR POSITIONS WITHOUT ANY QUESTION. THE DOCUMENT ASKS HOW SOME FORMER OFFICERS ARE ABLE TO LIVE SO WELL WHEN WE KNOW THEY GRADUATED FROM OUR MILITARY ALMA MATER. THE CASE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS IS ALSO EXAMINED IN THEIR LETTER. THEY NOTE THAT THE IDENTITY OF THE CULPRITS BECAME KNOWN SHORTLY AFTER THE MURDER, BUT SOME OF THE SENIOR OFFICERS WITHHELD IMPORTANT INFORMATION FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND ARMED FORCES COMMANDER IN CHIEF. A FEW HOURS AFTER THE MURDER, MANY OF US SUSPECTED WHAT HAD HAPPENED. WE, THE YOUNG OFFICERS, HAVE THE BEST SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND MANY OF US DID NOT THINK THAT THE CASE WOULD HAVE ANY MAJOR IMPACT BECAUSE THE ACTIVISM OF THE PRIESTS WITH THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL FRONT WAS WELL-KNOWN. HOWEVER, THERE WAS CAUSE FOR CONCERN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE CRIME BECAME KNOWN. THE PRIESTS' MURDER WAS DESCRIBED AS IRRATIONAL AND SENSELESS BECAUSE OPEN FIGHTING AGAINST TERRORISM IS ONE THING AND THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE IDEOLOGISTS IS ANOTHER. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE REPUBLIC MADE UP THE STORY ABOUT THE FMLN HATCHING A PLOT TO MURDER THE SAN SALVADOR BISHOPS IN AN ATTEMPT TO DISTRACT ATTENTION FROM THE KILLING OF THE PRIESTS, THE LETTER SAYS. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL COULD NOT BE REACHED FOR COMMENT ABOUT THIS. AS STATED BY THE YOUNG OFFICERS, WHEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S IDEA WAS RAISED, IT WAS POINTED OUT THAT IT WOULD NOT BE CREDIBLE. THIS WAS TREATED AS A CHILDISH AND ILLOGICAL WAY OUT. THE GROSS LIE MADE UP BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS NEVER CONSIDERED A PRACTICAL OPTION, THE DOCUMENT SAYS. THE SELF-STYLED DOMINGO MONTERROSA LIVES MOVEMENT HAS SENT THE LETTER TO PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, THE ASSEMBLY, AND THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND, ASKING THEM TO MEASURE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE POSITION ASSUMED BY THE U.S. EMBASSY AND VARIOUS SECTORS OF THE COUNTRY REGARDING MILITARY AID. THE YOUNG OFFICERS HAVE TAKEN THE NAME OF THE CHARISMATIC OFFICER WHO DIED WHEN HIS HELICOPTER WAS ATTACKED WHILE FLYING OVER THE AREA OF CACAOPERA, IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY'S EASTERN REGION. IN THEIR EXTENSIVE DOCUMENT THE YOUNG OFFICERS ASK PRESIDENT CRISTINI NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY REPORTS FROM THE HIGH COMMAND MEMBERS OF LA TANDONA .
DEV-MUC3-1262	NO CITY, NO DATE -- SAN SALVADOR DOMESTIC SERVICE IN SPANISH AT 1808 GMT ON 3 MAY BEGINS TO BROADCAST LIVE A NEWS CONFERENCE WITH SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL HOUSE IN SAN SALVADOR. CRISTIANI BEGINS BY SAYING THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING TO PUT TOGETHER A VIABLE AGENDA FOR ITS UPCOMING MEETING WITH THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT SO THAT SOME HEADWAY CAN BE MADE IN THE TALKS. HE ADDS: "FROM WHAT WE CAN FORESEE, WE HOPE THE DIRECT MEETINGS WILL BEGIN IN A WEEK AND A HALF, OR SOMEWHERE AROUND THERE. THAT IS WHEN WE THINK THEY COULD START.... IN GENERAL TERMS, WE DO BELIEVE PROGRESS WILL BE MADE AND THAT WE WILL ADVANCE QUITE RAPIDLY." IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION REGARDING A LETTER FROM AN UNNAMED GROUP OF YOUNG MILITARY OFFICERS ADVOCATING A PURGE OF THE MILITARY AND SUPPORTING CRITICISMS MADE BY FORMER ARMY COLONEL SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ, CRISTIANI SAYS: "I HAVE NEVER BELIEVED ANONYMOUS LETTERS OR NOTES. THE FACT THAT IT IS ANONYMOUS CASTS SOME DOUBT ON THE INTENTIONS BEHIND IT OR ABOUT THE GROUP THAT COULD BE SENDING IT. POSING AS YOUNG OFFICERS IS EASY TO DO. THIS COULD HAVE COME FROM THE FMLN -- MAKING AN ISSUE OF ALL THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT -- OR FROM ANY OTHER GROUP." REGARDING THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE ON THE REBELS' RECENT MILITARY OFFENSIVE, HE STATES: "I READ THE COMMUNIQUE AND I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT IT IS ONE OF THE MOST RIDICULOUS FMLN COMMUNIQUES I HAVE SEEN TO DATE.... I FEEL THAT THIS WAS A WAY TO SEEK NOTORIETY THROUGH THE NEWS. THIS COULD BE ONE OF THE REASONS. THE OTHER REASON COULD BE THAT THEY ARE HAVING PROBLEMS AMONG THEMSELVES.... SOME OF THEM VIEW THE DIALOGUE AS SOMETHING SERIOUS WHILE OTHERS DO NOT, AND IT COULD BE THAT THESE PROBLEMS ARE RESULTING IN THESE IRRATIONAL ADVENTURES BY THE FMLN." TURNING TO RECENT U.S. GOVERNMENT CRITICISM CHARGING SLOWNESS IN THE HANDLING OF THE INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF THOSE INVOLVED IN THE JESUIT MURDER CASE, CRISTIANI SAYS: "AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE, I CANNOT SPEED UP, SLOW DOWN, OR ALTER THE JUDGE'S DECISIONS. IN NO DEMOCRACY CAN THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE DICTATE ORDERS TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. THE SAME HAPPENS IN THE UNITED STATES AS IN ANY OTHER DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY. I BELIEVE THAT AS FAR AS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE -- ALTHOUGH THERE IS MUCH URGENCY IN SEEING THIS TRIAL COMPLETED; THERE ARE GREAT EXPECTATIONS -- THAT THE JUDGE IS DUTY BOUND TO CONTINUE WITH THE JUDICIAL PROCEDURES STIPULATED BY SALVADORAN LAW." HE POINTS OUT THAT THE PROSECUTION OF GENERAL NORIEGA IN THE UNITED STATES IS ALSO TAKING A LONG TIME. REGARDING A REPORTED FMLN ATTACK ON HIS RESIDENCE IN SAN SALVADOR YESTERDAY, CRISTIANI SAYS: "I DO NOT KNOW WHO THE PERSON WAS WHO REPORTED AN ATTACK ON THE PRESIDENTIAL RESIDENCE, EITHER THE OFFICIAL OR THE PRIVATE ONE. NEITHER OF THEM WAS ATTACKED, THOUGH THERE COULD HAVE BEEN SOME INFORMATION THAT SUCH AN ATTACK WAS EXPECTED. AN FMLN COLUMN WAS DISPERSED IN AREAS CLOSE TO THE TWO RESIDENCES." QUESTIONED ABOUT THE EFFECTS ON THE GOVERNMENT OF A POSSIBLE CUT IN U.S. GOVERNMENT AID TO EL SALVADOR, CRISTIANI RESPONDS: "WELL, I THINK THAT FIRST OF ALL, THE EFFECTS OF A REDUCTION OR CUT OF AID WOULD BE TWOFOLD. FIRST, I THINK IT WOULD BE A NEGATIVE SIGNAL FOR THE FMLN AND FOR THE OBJECTIVE OF TRYING TO FIND AN END TO THE CONFLICT THROUGH THE DIALOGUE PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN STARTED; AND THAT A CUT IN AID MIGHT BE ANALYZED BY SOME OF THE MEMBERS, OR ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FMLN, AS MEANING A WEAKENING OF THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS DEFENSE AND THAT, THEREFORE, THEIR MILITARY VICTORY IS NOW CLOSER. AND IT WOULD MAKE IT A LOT MORE DIFFICULT TO END THE CONFLICT IN A SHORT WHILE THROUGH A POLITICAL DIALOGUE. SECOND, OBVIOUSLY THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO DEFEND THE INSTITUTIONS, THE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS OF THE COUNTRY, AND WILL NOT STANDBY WITH A WEAKENED DEFENSE. THEREFORE, THIS MEANS REALLOCATING RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BE USED FOR OTHER TYPES OF PROGRAMS -- SOCIAL PROGRAMS, ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL PROGRAMS -- ... FOR DEFENSE PURPOSES." RETURNING THE JESUITS MURDER CASE, CRISTIANI IS ASKED IF THE MILITARY HIGH COMMAND IS BEING INVESTIGATED. HE SAYS: "FIRST OF ALL I WOULD SAY THAT THE HIGH COMMAND -- AND THIS IS JUST MY OWN POINT OF VIEW -- WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT THE INVESTIGATION. THE HIGH COMMAND MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR THE INVESTIGATION TO BE WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES, AN INVESTIGATION THAT HAS NO PRECEDENT IN THE PAST WITH RESPECT TO INVESTIGATING MILITARY UNITS.... IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT BY SUPPORTING THE INVESTIGATION AND OPENING UP THE ARMED FORCES SO THAT THEY CAN BE INVESTIGATED IN THIS CASE, THEY WOULD HAVE DONE SO IF THERE WERE SOME INVOLVEMENT ON THEIR PART." FURTHER AS AVAILABLE.
DEV-MUC3-1263	SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 90 -- JUAN AMADEO CABRERA FROM LA NOTICIA. MR. PRESIDENT, IF THE COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE YOUNG MILITARY OFFICERS IS TRUE, IF IT IS TRUE THAT THEY ARE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES, WHAT IS THE OUTLOOK FOR THE ARMED FORCES AND FOR YOUR GOVERNMENT? I BELIEVE SOME SPECULATION WOULD BE REQUIRED. I BELIEVE THAT AS AN ANONYMOUS LETTER, IT CANNOT BE GIVEN THE CREDIT IT DESERVES, IF IT WAS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE WHO IS COMPLETELY RESPONSIBLE. IN THIS REGARD, I REPEAT THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN WILLING TO CONDUCT A PROCESS OF PROFESSIONALIZING AND MODERNIZING. THEY ARE TRYING TO IMPROVE THEIR INSTITUTION AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. LUISA MELGAR FROM TELEPRENSA. MR. PRESIDENT, YESTERDAY THE FMLN CARRIED OUT DIFFERENT ARMED ACTIONS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND JUSTIFIED THE ACTIONS BECAUSE OF ALLEGED HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, REPRESSION, AND LACK OF SECURITY FOR CIVILIANS. HOW DO YOU VIEW THESE ACTIONS JUST WHEN THE TALKS ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN? I READ THE COMMUNIQUE AND I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT IT IS ONE OF THE MOST RIDICULOUS FMLN COMMUNIQUES I HAVE SEEN TO DATE. IT IS A JUSTIFICATION THAT IS NOT VERY JUSTIFIABLE, I WOULD SAY. I BELIEVE THE EVENTS ON 1 MAY IN THE MORNING CAN CLEARLY BE UNDERSTOOD. ALL GROUPS WISHING TO PARTICIPATE WERE ABLE TO MARCH PEACEFULLY. THEIR FREEDOMS ARE NOT BEING REPRESSED. I IMAGINE YOU HAVE ALL HEARD AND SEEN WHAT THEY SAID AND DID AND THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS. I FEEL THAT THIS WAS A WAY TO SEEK NOTORIETY THROUGH THE NEWS. THIS COULD BE ONE OF THE REASONS. THE OTHER REASON COULD BE THAT THEY ARE HAVING PROBLEMS AMONG THEMSELVES. WE HAVE INFORMATION TELLING US THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES AMONG THE DIFFERENT GROUPS. SOME OF THEM VIEW THE DIALOGUE AS SOMETHING SERIOUS, WHILE OTHERS DO NOT, AND IT COULD BE THAT THESE PROBLEMS ARE RESULTING IN THESE IRRATIONAL ADVENTURES BY THE FMLN. I FEEL THAT AT THIS STAGE OF THE DIALOGUE PROCESS, THEIR ACTIONS ARE COMPLETELY UNJUSTIFIABLE. THAT IS NOT ALL. THEY HAVE EVEN VIOLATED WHAT THEY HAVE CALLED UNILATERAL GESTURES MADE IN THE PAST. THIS SHOWS THE LACK OF SERIOUSNESS AND SINCERITY IN ALL OF THEM, OR SOME OF THEM, CONCERNING THE OBJECTIVES WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH THE DIALOGUE PROCESS. GUILLERMO PENATE FROM EL DIARIO DE HOY. THERE ARE SOME LABOR GROUPS THAT WANT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE DELEGATION THAT WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE TALKS WITH THE FMLN. COULD THIS NOT BE SOME SORT OF DISADVANTAGE FOR THE OFFICIAL DELEGATION, BECAUSE THE OPPOSITE GROUPS COULD GAIN STRENGTH? I THINK THAT IS TRUE. SOME GROUPS HAVE ASKED TO BE INCLUDED IN THE DELEGATION. I BELIEVE THE PARTICIPATION OF THE DIFFERENT GROUPS IS STIPULATED IN THE GENEVA AGREEMENTS. WE HAVE ALREADY EXPLAINED HOW THE GOVERNMENT CAN ALLOW FOR THE PARTICIPATION OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SECTORS OF THE COUNTRY. WE ARE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION, WHICH IS COMPRISED OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS FOR THE MOST PART. I BELIEVE THAT THE PARTICIPATION OF MEMBERS OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS HAS ALREADY BEEN EXPLAINED IN THE PAST. RAUL BELTRAN FROM RADIO CADENA YSKL. MR. PRESIDENT, OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT THE OFFICIAL STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE COMMANDERS OF THE VARIOUS GARRISONS AND THE HIGH COMMAND. SINCE YOU ARE THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES, DO YOU SUPPORT THE DOCUMENT THAT WAS PUBLISHED, WHICH CONDEMNED THE STATEMENTS MADE BY COL. SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ? CONCERNING THAT SITUATION, I HAVE SAID THAT SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE MADE STATEMENTS, NOT JUST ONE. THERE HAS BEEN PUBLIC SPECULATION AS TO WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED IN THE ASSASSINATIONS OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE OTHER TWO PEOPLE AND THAT IS NOT RIGHT. IF SOMEONE HAS ANY INFORMATION TO CONTRIBUTE, AND IF THAT SOMEONE IS REALLY INTERESTED IN THE PROGRESS OF JUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY, HE SHOULD GO TO THE JUDGE TO GIVE HIM THE INFORMATION. HE SHOULD NOT CONTINUE TO SPECULATE IN PUBLIC, BECAUSE IT CONFUSES PEOPLE AND IT OBSTRUCTS THE JUDICIAL PROCESS. I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT NOT LONG AGO A DELEGATION OF SPANISH LEGAL EXPERTS VISITED THE COUNTRY AND THEY WERE PLEASED TO SEE HOW THE 4TH CRIMINAL JUDGE WAS HANDLING THE JUDICIAL PROCESS, AS OPPOSED TO OTHER REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED IN THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT NO ONE SHOULD SPECULATE IN PUBLIC AS TO WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED. IF SOMEONE HAS INFORMATION OR EVIDENCE, HE SHOULD GO TO THE JUDGE, OTHERWISE THERE WILL BE CONFUSION. IN THAT REGARD, I BELIEVE THAT THE ARMED FORCES COMMANDERS' REJECTION OF COL. OCHOA'S STATEMENTS IS JUST THAT. IN MANY OF THE STATEMENTS THEY WROTE -- I DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN DRAFTING THE STATEMENT -- THEY MENTIONED THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO SUPPORT AND STRENGTHEN THE JUDICIAL PROCESS, BUT THEY CANNOT COME OUT IN PUBLIC WITH SPECULATION BECAUSE THEY WOULD ONLY CONFUSE PEOPLE.
DEV-MUC3-1264	SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 90 -- HOWEVER, THE FMLN IDEA THAT THEY HAVE TO SHOW FORCE HERE, OR THERE, OR SOMEWHERE IS NOT LOGICAL. THE IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE IN PEACE AND TRANQUILITY. THEREFORE, IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE THAT THEY MAY HAVE 1,000, 2,000, OR 100. THAT DOES NOT MATTER. I THINK THAT, WHETHER THEY HAVE A HIGH OR A LOW MORALE OR WHATEVER, WITH JUST 100 RADICALS THEY COULD KILL PEOPLE AND DESTROY SOURCES OF EMPLOYMENT. IN SUM, THEY CAUSE PANIC AND TERROR IN SOME HAMLETS. I BELIEVE THAT HAS TO BE STOPPED. IT IS NOT A MATTER OF WHO SHOWS FORCE AND WHO DOES NOT. REGARDLESS OF THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF FORCE THE FMLN MAY CARRY OUT, WE STILL BELIEVE THAT, IN THE LONG RUN, THE MILITARY VICTORY BY THE GOVERNMENT FORCES AND THE GOVERNMENT IS POSSIBLE, BECAUSE THEY HAVE A STRONG MORAL SUPPORT. THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE AND HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE SUPPORT THE SYSTEM AND THE GOVERNMENT, NO MATTER WHO IS HEADING IT, NOT JUST A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL. HOWEVER, THAT IS NOT THE POINT. WE DO NOT WANT THIS CONFLICT TO LAST 10 YEARS LONGER, WITH MORE BLOODSHED. THEREFORE, WE ARE SEARCHING FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN IT, NOT BECAUSE IT SUITS US BECAUSE THEY ARE STRONGER OR NOT STRONGER. JAMES LOHMAN. MR. PRESIDENT, WITH THE REDUCTION IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S MILITARY AID, HAS YOUR GOVERNMENT CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY OF SEEKING MILITARY AID IN OTHER COUNTRIES ON THIS CONTINENT OR FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD? FOR EXAMPLE, WE KNOW THAT A COUNTRY LIKE ISRAEL HAS GIVEN MILITARY AID TO CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES. HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THAT POSSIBILITY? I CAN ONLY TELL YOU THAT, YES, CERTAINLY, THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS THE DUTY OF DEFENDING THE SYSTEM AND THE SALVADORAN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, AND -- REGARDLESS OF WHAT MAY HAPPEN, AND WE HOPE THAT WILL NOT OCCUR -- IF THAT HAPPENS, WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE TO SEEK ALTERNATE RESOURCES FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. A FEW DAYS AGO I LISTENED TO STATEMENTS BY SOME POLITICIANS AND MEMBERS OF OTHER SECTORS, WHO COMPLAINED BECAUSE I SAID: WE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DEFENDING THE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, WE HAVE TO FIND THE RESOURCES, AND THERE ARE OTHER ALTERNATIVES TO GET RESOURCES FOR THE NATIONAL DEFENSE. THOSE POLITICIANS SAID IT WOULD BE DISASTROUS TO AFFECT SOCIAL PROGRAMS TO HELP THE NEEDY. THAT IS ACTUALLY WHAT THOSE POLITICIANS SHOULD THINK ABOUT WHEN THEY ASK FOR A REDUCTION IN AID. I BELIEVE THAT IS SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT NEGLECT. THE GOVERNMENT MUST DEFEND THE SYSTEM FROM POSSIBLE ATTACKS -- THROUGH VIOLENCE TO REACH POWER -- WHICH HAS BEEN TERMED BY CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND BY MANY COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AS ILLEGAL. HAVE YOU CONSIDERED ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT WE ARE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION SOME ALTERNATIVES. HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT GOING TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS DEFENSELESS. WE WILL NOW HAVE QUESTIONS IN ENGLISH. TOM GIBBS FROM THE BBC. WHAT WOULD BE THE EFFECT OF CUTTING U.S. MILITARY AID? AND ALSO IT SEEMS THAT THE DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS PUT AS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE CONTINUATION OF AID THE JESUITS' CASE, AND ALSO THE CLEANING UP OF THE OFFICERS CORPS OF THE ARMY, OR CHANGES IN THE MILITARY. HOW INCONVENIENT WOULD IT BE TO YOUR GOVERNMENT, OR HOW IT WOULD BE TO YOUR GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE TO ? WELL, I THINK THAT, FIRST OF ALL, THE EFFECT OF THE REDUCTION OR CUT OF AID WOULD BE TWOFOLD. ON THE FIRST HAND, I THINK IT WOULD BE A NEGATIVE SIGNAL FOR THE FMLN AND FOR THE OBJECTIVE OF TRYING TO FIND AN END TO THE CONFLICT THROUGH THE DIALOGUE PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN STARTED, AND THAT A CUT IN AID MIGHT BE ANALYZED BY SOME OF THE MEMBERS, OR ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FMLN, AS MEANING A WEAKENING OF THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS DEFENSE AND THAT, THEREFORE, THEIR MILITARY VICTORY IS NOW CLOSER. AND IT WOULD MAKE IT A LOT MORE DIFFICULT TO END THE CONFLICT IN A SHORT WHILE THROUGH A POLITICAL DIALOGUE. SECONDLY, OBVIOUSLY THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO DEFEND THE INSTITUTIONS, THE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS OF THE COUNTRY, AND WILL NOT STAND BY WITH A WEAKENED DEFENSE. THEREFORE, THIS MEANS REALLOCATING RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BE USED FOR OTHER TYPES OF PROGRAMS -- SOCIAL PROGRAMS, ECONOMIC, OR POLITICAL PROGRAMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN HAVE ACCESS TO, AND OBVIOUSLY TO REALLOCATE RESOURCES FOR DEFENSE PURPOSES. THUS, IT WOULD HAVE A TWOFOLD IMPACT IF THAT WAS THE CASE. ON THE OTHER HAND, I THINK THAT THE JUDICIAL PROCESS IN THE CASE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS IS ONGOING. IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO THINK THAT BEFORE IT HAS ENDED, THAT THERE IS PREJUDGEMENT ON WHAT THE RESULTS WOULD BE. I THINK THAT THE JUDGE, AS I SAID EARLIER, HAS RECEIVED AT LEAST THE VISITS OF MANY PEOPLE. JUST RECENTLY A GROUP OF LAWYERS FROM SPAIN CAME IN AND ANALYZED THE CASE, AND WERE VERY PLEASED WITH THE WAY THE JUDGE WAS HANDLING THE CASE, ACCORDING, OBVIOUSLY, TO SALVADORAN LAW.
DEV-MUC3-1265	SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 90 -- COMMANDER JORGE MELENDEZ , A TOP SALVADORAN GUERRILLA LEADER, ADMITTED ON THURSDAY TO A CHANGE IN THE U.S. POLICY TOWARD THIS COUNTRY AND SAID THAT THE GEORGE BUSH ADMINISTRATION NOW "FAVORS" A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE WAR. MELENDEZ, WHO IS A STAFF MEMBER OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT IN THE EASTERN DEPARTMENT OF MORAZAN, SAID ON THE CLANDESTINE STATION RADIO VENCEREMOS THAT THE AMERICANS ARE MAKING A FOREIGN POLICY CHANGE. "JONAS" TALKED ABOUT A POSSIBLE CUT IN U.S. MILITARY AID TO THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, SAYING THAT "WE CAN NOW SAY THAT THIS CHANGE ANNOUNCES THE FRAMEWORK OF HIS POLICY TODAY." "JUST AS THEY IMPOSED THE WAR, TODAY THEY ARE ALSO IMPOSING CONDITIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE SEARCH FOR A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION," THE GUERRILLA LEADER SAID. A U.S. SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE VOTED FOR A CUT IN THE U.S. MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO EL SALVADOR AND LINKED ANOTHER CUT IN THE AID TO THE PROGRESS MADE IN THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS TO END A WAR THAT HAS LASTED A DECADE AND LEFT 72,000 PEOPLE KILLED. TO DEAL WITH THE CUT IN MILITARY AID, THE GOVERNMENT OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI SAID THAT THE SITUATION WOULD FORCE IT TO MAKE BUDGET CUTS IN OTHER AREAS, SUCH AS HEALTH AND EDUCATION. IN THIS REGARD, "JONAS" SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT WARNINGS ARE AIMED AT MAINTAINING THE MILITARY STRUGGLE AT THE EXPENSE OF "SEVERELY PUNISHING THE PEOPLE AND ALL LOWER-CLASS GROUPS." HOWEVER, MELENDEZ INSISTED THAT "THE MILITARY POLICY IN EL SALVADOR IS WEAKENING...AND NEW CONDITIONS ARE BEING OPENED."
DEV-MUC3-1266	SAN SALVADOR, 4 MAY 90 -- THE MILITARY HIGH COMMAND EMPHATICALLY REJECTS THE JUNIOR OFFICER'S STATEMENTS, CONSIDERED A TYPE OF GRAY PROPOGANDA, BECAUSE NO PERSON OR GROUP OF PERSONS HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM. THE STATEMENTS ARE BIASED IN FAVOR OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT . ON 10 JANUARY 1981 A SERIES OF SIMILARLY ANONYMOUS LETTERS AND STATEMENTS WERE CIRCULATED. THE MILITARY INTELLIGENCE LEARNED THAT THE LETTERS WERE PART OF A STRATEGY IMPLEMENTED BY FORMER CAPTAIN FRANCISCO SANDOVAL, ALONG WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SALVADORAN SUBVERSION. IN ADDITION, SOMETHING SIMILAR HAPPENED IN NOVEMBER 1989, BUT THIS TIME IT WAS DONE BY A HIGH-RANKING MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF SALVADORAN WORKERS, WHO CLAIMED THAT HE HAD RECEIVED A COMMUNIQUE FROM JUNIOR OFFICERS ON A NUMBER OF IRREGULARITIES THAT WERE REPORTEDLY OCCURRING WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES. THE FMLN TERRORIST GROUPS LAUNCHED OFFENSIVES ON BOTH OCCASIONS. ACCORDING TO THEIR GOALS, THE FINAL TASK WAS TO SEIZE POWER BY FORCE AND BY ALL MEANS, EVEN IF THEY HAD TO SACRIFICE THE LIVES OF MANY SALVADORAN CIVILIANS AND SEVERELY DAMAGE HOUSES AND THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE. THE ARMED FORCES ARE AWARE OF THEIR HIGH LEVEL OF PROFESSIONALISM AND THEIR OWN INSTITUTIONAL ETHICS AND PHILOSOPHY AS DEMANDED BY THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC AND REITERATE THAT THEIR MISSION WILL ALWAYS BE TO DEFEND THE NATION'S SOVEREIGNTY AND TO PROTECT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S LIFE AND INTERESTS. THEREFORE, IT IS USELESS TO TRY TO UNDERMINE THE ARMED FORCES' MORALE AND TO CONFUSE AND DIVIDE ALL THE MEMBERS COMPRISING THE ARMED FORCES THROUGH GROUNDLESS COMMUNIQUES WHICH ARE INTENDED TO CREATE FALSE EXPECTATIONS FOR THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC.
DEV-MUC3-1267	SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE -- I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION. A FEW MOMENTS AGO, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI TERMED THE MOST RIDICULOUS COMMUNIQUE HE HAD EVER HEARD FROM THE FMLN THE ONE IN WHICH THEY JUSTIFIED YESTERDAY'S MILITARY ACTIONS. HE TERMED THEM PROPAGANDA-ORIENTED. WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE NEGOTIATIONS, HOW DO YOU VIEW THIS? IN MY OPINION, THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE HAS ASPECTS THAT ARE INTERESTING AND OTHERS WHICH I THINK ARE NOT VALID. THE TIME AND OPPORTUNITY OF THAT ACTION IS AMBIVALENT. I THINK IT HAS NEGATIVE EFFECTS, AS WELL AS POSITIVE EFFECTS FOR THEM. THERE IS ALWAYS THE FAMOUS VICIOUS CIRCLE WHEREIN IF THE FMLN CEASES TO ACT MILITARILY, IT IS BAD FOR THE FMLN BECAUSE IT SHOWS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS. IF IT ACTS MILITARILY IT IS ALSO BAD, BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT IT DOES NOT WANT PEACE. IN THIS SENSE, I THINK THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT IT HAS EXHIBITED A SHOW OF FORCE, THAT ITS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN STRICTLY PROPAGANDA-ORIENTED OR WITH PROPAGANDA OBJECTIVES. IT DOES NOT CEASE TO CREATE DIFFICULT CONDITIONS THAT GENERATE A NEGATIVE REACTION ON THE OTHER'S PART, IF THEY WANT TO SIT DOWN AND TRY TO EASE CONFRONTATIONS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND SEEK AN AGREEMENT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. I BELIEVE, AS I TOLD PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ON THE TELEPHONE YESTERDAY WHEN WE SPOKE OF OTHER THINGS BUT TOUCHED ON THIS TOPIC, THAT I UPHOLD THE GOVERNMENT'S THESIS. WE HAVE ALWAYS CRITICIZED THE FACT THAT WHEN NEGATIVE THINGS OCCUR, THEY ARE INVOKED TO SUSPEND A PROCESS WHICH IN OUR OPINION SHOULD BE CONTINUOUS. WE HAVE ALWAYS UPHELD THE CONTINUITY OF THE DIALOGUE. THE GOVERNMENT CRITICIZED THE FMLN WHEN ON TWO OCCASIONS IT SUSPENDED THE DIALOGUE DUE TO TERRORIST ACTIONS ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT OR SECURITY CORPS. THE DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION PROCESS HAS SUFFERED AS A RESULT OF THIS. I BELIEVE THAT IN THIS CASE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAKE ITS OWN MEDICINE. IT SHOULD MAINTAIN THE CONTINUITY OF THE PROCESS AND NOT USE AS A PRETEXT THE FMLN MILITARY ACTIONS TO TRY TO SEEK WAYS OF CONDITIONING OR PERTURBING A PROCESS OF DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION, WHICH INVOLVES NOT ONLY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN, BUT THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND SOCIAL FORCES AS WELL. DR. UNGO, IN THAT SENSE THE GOVERNMENT HAD ANNOUNCED THROUGH PRESIDENT CRISTIANI THAT THE DIALOGUE WOULD BE RESUMED ON 3 MAY. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL'S ENVOY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD BE THE FIRST PART OF MAY. DON'T YOU THINK THAT TOO MUCH TIME IS BEING SPENT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO AGREE ON SUMMIT MEETINGS THAT WILL PERMIT SECURING AGREEMENTS? I HAVE A VERY POSITIVE ANALYSIS OF HOW THE PROCESS IS DEVELOPING IN THIS FIRST PHASE, JUDGING BY THE CONDUCT ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN. I THINK THERE HAS BEEN A DELAY, BUT I THINK IT IS A DELAY THAT IMPROVES THE POSSIBILITIES AND CONDITIONS. APPARENTLY THE TIMES WERE MARKED BY HASTE AND PRECIPITATION FOR THE FMLN TO PRESENT A PROPOSAL. ALSO, THERE WAS A VERY SHORT TIME FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PREPARE ITS RESPONSE AND HOLD A BILATERAL MEETING LATER. AT THE SAME TIME, IT LEFT A VERY NARROW MARGIN OF INFLUENCE TO THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS. PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HIMSELF CONVENED THE POLITICAL PARTIES TO EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT THE SITUATION WAS AND HOW HE VIEWED THE ROLE OF THE PARTIES. THE PARTIES HAVE THEIR OWN CONCEPT OF THEIR ROLE AND HAVE BEEN WORKING ARDUOUSLY AND RESPONSIBLY. IN TWO WEEKS THEY HELD FOUR PROLONGED, HIGH-LEVEL MEETINGS, TWO PER WEEK. WE WANT TO DO THE SAME THING WITH THE FMLN. I BELIEVE THAT THE PERIOD OF TWO TO THREE WEEKS TO ONE MONTH, SINCE THE GENEVA AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED, HAS BEEN POSITIVE. IF WE HAD HURRIED THINGS UP, PERHAPS THE POSSIBILITY OF ACHIEVING RESULTS WOULD HAVE BEEN AFFECTED. WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT ALL OF THIS GIVES WAY TO SOMEWHAT PESSIMISTIC EVALUATIONS, BECAUSE THE CONFIDENTIALITY WAS VIOLATED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI. I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THESE THINGS ARE PART OF A PRIVATE, CONFIDENTIAL AIDE-MEMOIRE THAT WAS AGREED TO IN GENEVA BETWEEN THE TWO TOP LEADERS OF THE FMLN AND THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATION WITH UN SECRETARY GENERAL PEREZ DE CUELLAR'S REPRESENTATIVE.
DEV-MUC3-1268	GUATEMALA CITY, 5 MAY 90 -- OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT A GUATEMALAN CARGO PLANE OWNED BY THE TRASLADOS COMPANY CRASHED THIS AFTERNOON ON TOP OF SEVERAL HOUSES IN NORTHERN GUATEMALA CITY, CAUSING AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF DEAD AND WOUNDED. CIVIL AERONAUTICS PERSONNEL CONFIRMED TO ACAN - EFE THAT THE THREE CREW MEMBERS OF THE DC-6 WERE U.S. CITIZENS WHO HAD BEEN HIRED TO FLY THE PLANE TO MIAMI. SOURCES FROM THE MUNICIPAL FIRE DEPARTMENT SAID THE PLANE DESTROYED 12 HOUSES. THE NUMBER OF DEAD AND WOUNDED ARE STILL UNKNOWN. ACCORDING TO THE INITIAL REPORTS, THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED SHORTLY AFTER THE PLANE TOOK OFF FROM THE LA AURORA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, AND APPARENTLY WAS DUE TO THE LOSS OF AN ENGINE. FIRE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN HAROLDO JUAREZ SAID THERE HAVE BEEN EXPLOSIONS IN THE DRAINAGE SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THE GASES THAT HAD ACCUMULATED FROM THE FUEL SPILLED BY THE PLANE.

DEV-MUC3-1270	GUATEMALA CITY, 30 APR 90 -- THE MUTUAL SUPPORT GROUP HAS REPORTED FINDING 25 CLANDESTINE CEMETERIES IN THE COUNTRY'S WESTERN HIGH PLATEAU AREA, NOTING THAT PROCEEDINGS REQUIRED FOR AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CEMETERIES HAVE BEGUN. ACCORDING TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP, MOST OF THE CEMETERIES ARE IN HAMLETS AND COMMUNITIES LOCATED IN THE GUATEMALAN HIGH PLATEAU, AN AREA THAT SUFFERED A GREAT AMOUNT OF VIOLENCE DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN 1979 AND 1982. THE PRESIDENT SAID: "THE PEOPLE THAT ARE BURIED IN THESE HIDDEN CEMETERIES WERE RELATIVES OF SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO BELONG TO OUR HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATION." GAM PRESIDENT NINETH DE GARCIA ADDED: "ALL THE CRIMES WERE COMMITTED BY MEN WHO HIDE IN ANONYMITY AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE KIDNAPPING AND DISAPPEARANCES IN OUR COUNTRY." OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS, GAM HAS INTENSIFIED ITS SEARCH FOR CLANDESTINE CEMETERIES AND HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL: THREE CEMETERIES WERE FOUND IN EL QUICHE, ONE IN CHIMALTENANGO, ONE IN SACATEPEQUEZ, AND ONE FOUND IN CHINAUTLA LAST YEAR. "OUR ACTIVISTS IN THE GUATEMALAN HIGH PLATEAU AREA HAVE REPORTED SEVERAL TIMES TO OUR HEADQUARTERS THAT CHUPOL'CIVIL PATROL GUARDS HAVE KIDNAPPED THEIR RELATIVES, THAT TWO CEMETERIES EXIST IN THAT COMMUNITY, AND THAT OTHER CEMETERIES ARE LOCATED IN USPANTAN, EL QUICHE, ZACUALPA, AND THE REST OF THE MUNICIPALITIES IN THIS AREA," SHE SAID. "THERE ARE MORE THAN 100 CEMETERIES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN REPORTED TO THE EL QUICHE 2D PENAL COURT AND PENDING AN INVESTIGATION. HOWEVER, THIS COURT HAS NOT ISSUED THE REQUIRED EXHUMATION ORDERS FOR THE INVESTIGATIONS TO CONTINUE; THIS MEANS THAT THEY HAVE DELIBERATELY SHELVED THE CHARGES WE PRESENTED AT THE COURTHOUSE BECAUSE THEY REFUSE TO CARRY OUT THE REQUIRED LEGAL PROCEDURES," SAID THE GAM PRESIDENT. NINETH DE GARCIA STATED: "THE RELATIVES OF THOSE WHO HAVE DISAPPEARED, REQUEST THAT THE KIDNAPPERS AND MURDERERS OF OUR RELATIVES BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL AND PUNISHED. IN A MONTH'S TIME, OUR FOUNDATION WILL HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR SIX YEARS AND, UP TO NOW, PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO HAS REFUSED TO FORM A COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THE CASES OF THE 40,000 PEOPLE WHO HAVE DISAPPEARED."

DEV-MUC3-1272	SAN SALVADOR, 8 MAY 90 -- THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS WARNED TODAY THAT THE POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF GENERAL HUMBERTO LARIOS BY COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CURRENT CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE ARMED FORCES, "WILL SERIOUSLY AFFECT THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS" WITH THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH WILL BE RESUMED THIS COMING 16 MAY IN VENEZUELA. THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT RELEASED A COMMUNIQUE HERE TODAY ON THE CHANGE IN THE SALVADORAN MILITARY LEADERSHIP AS WELL AS THE POSSIBLE RETIREMENT OF DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTER COLONEL ORLANDO ZEPEDA. "THESE CHANGES WILL SERIOUSLY AFFECT THE CONCERTED CEASE-FIRE PROCESS, BECAUSE ONE CANNOT REACH AGREEMENTS BASED ON DEMOCRATIZATION WHILE IMPUNITY PREVAILS IN THE ARMY AND IT IS NOT SUBJECTED TO A THOROUGH PURGE," THE FMLN ADDED. GEN LARIOS TOLD NEWSMEN YESTERDAY ABOUT HIS POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT BY COL EMILIO PONCE IN THE DEFENSE MINISTRY IS A CHANGE WHICH HE REGARDED AS "NATURAL." "EVENTUALLY THERE MAY BE A CHANGE OF THAT SORT. IT IS A NATURAL AND ROUTINE CHANGE," THE DEFENSE MINISTER SAID WHEN ASKED ABOUT PERSISTENT RUMORS TO THIS EFFECT IN THAT PAST FEW DAYS IN EL SALVADOR. COL PONCE, A MEMBER OF THE 1966 GRADUATION CLASS KNOWN AS "LA TANDONA," CURRENTLY HAS GREAT INFLUENCE AMONG THE ARMED FORCES OFFICERS. HE HAS HELD THE POST OF CHIEF OF STAFF SINCE THE MIDDLE OF LAST YEAR. THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE STATED THAT PONCE'S REMOVAL FROM THE POST OF CHIEF OF STATE "WOULD BREAK THE CHAIN OF RESPONSIBILITY OF THE HIGH COMMAND IN THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS." THE JESUIT PRIESTS WERE ASSASSINATED ON 16 NOVEMBER BY ALLEGED ARMED FORCES MEMBERS, WHO WERE TURNED OVER TO JUDICIARY AUTHORITIES.

SPEAKING AT LUNCHEON WITH THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IN THE PORT CITY OF VALPARAISO, MOQEDI CALLED THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT NAIVE FOR AGREEING TO RECEIVE AN OFFICIAL FROM THE PLO. MOQEDI SAID CHILE HAD NOT UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE CALLED THE REAL NATURE OF THIS TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. CHILE'S FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THE ISRAELI AMBASSADOR HAD GIVEN ASSURANCES OF HIS DEEP RESPECT FOR THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT, AND EXPLAINED HE MAY HAVE USED IMPROPER LANGUAGE BECAUSE OF HIS LESS THAN FLUENT SPANISH. HE SAID THE ISSUE WAS NOW RESOLVED. THE PLO OFFICIAL FARUQ QADDUMI VISITED CHILE LAST WEEK, AND MET WITH SEVERAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, INCLUDING PRESIDENT PATRICIO AYLWIN.
DEV-MUC3-1274	SAN SALVADOR, 6 MAY 90 -- FIRST LADY OF THE NATION, MR. VICE PRESIDENT, YOUR EXCELLENCIES OF THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS, MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND, GENERALS, CHIEFS, OFFICERS, NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS, TROOPS, PUBLIC SECURITY POLICEMEN, AND ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL, SALVADORAN PEOPLE: WE HAVE GATHERED HERE, UNITED BY A SHARED FEELING OF PATRIOTISM, TO OFFER A TRIBUTE OF ADMIRATION AND APPRECIATION TO ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF OUR ARMED FORCES. WITHIN THE COMMEMORATIVE FRAMEWORK OF SOLDIERS DAY, FROM THE VERY DEPTH OF OUR HEARTS, WE FIRST OF ALL PAY HOMAGE OF UNDYDING GRATITUDE TO OUR SALVADORAN BROTHERS WHO, WEARING THE ARMED FORCES' UNIFORM, HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES TO DEFEND OUR DEAR FATHERLAND. WITH THEIR GENEROUS BLOOD THEY HAVE FERTILIZED THE PATH OF PEACE, DEMOCRACY, AND FREEDOM FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. WE PAY HOMAGE TO THE SOLDIERS KILLED IN COMBAT WHILE FULFILLING THE SACRED MISSION OF DEFENDING THE RPUBLIC'S SOVEREIGNTY AND INTEGRITY. IT IS WITH EMOTION THAT WE EVOKE THOSE BROTHERS WHO, STOICALLY CONFRONTING DANGER AND DEATH, GAVE THEIR LIVES SO THAT OUR COUNTRY WOULD HAVE A BETTER FUTURE, AND SO THAT PRESENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS COULD BUILD A MORE HUMAN AND SOLIDARY SOCIETY. WE PAY SPECIAL TRIBUTE TO ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO, IN THE FULL BLOOM OF YOUTH, HAS GONE ON TO FORM PART OF OUR ARMED FORCES' GLORIOUS HISTORY, WHO GAVE HIS LIFE FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. I AM REFERRING TO CAPTAIN JOSE ALFONSO CHAVEZ GARCIA, A WORTHY EXAMPLE OF DEVOTION TO SERVICE TO THE FATHERLAND. HIS MEMORY WILL ALWAYS BE A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION TO EVERY SALVADORAN SOLDIER WHO IS FIGHTING FOR OUR PEOPLE'S FREEDOM AND GLORY. AS OF TODAY, THE SPECIAL ANTI- TERRORIST COMMANDO, CEAT, WILL BEAR CAPT CHAVEZ' NAME IN JUST RECOGNITION OF HIS PROFESSIONALISM AND DEVOTION TO THE FATHERLAND'S SACRED VALUES. WITH THESE SAME FEELINGS OF ADMIRATION AND AFFECTION, WE GREET THE MOTHERS, FATHERS, CHILDREN, BROTHERS, WIVES, AND RELATIVES OF OUR SOLDIERS, WHO IN FULFILLING THEIR DUTIES HAVE WRITTEN PAGES OF FEARLESSNESS AND COURAGE, THEREBY ENDLESSLY PROLONGING THEIR NOBLE EXAMPLES IN OUR PEOPLE'S CONSCIENCES. AT THIS SOLDIERS DAY EVENT, IN MY CAPACITY AS PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND GENERAL COMMANDER OF THE ARMED FORCES, I STRONGLY EMBRACE ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF OUR ARMED INSTITUTION.
DEV-MUC3-1275	SAN SALVADOR, 9 MAY 90 -- A QUAKE MEASURING FOUR DEGREES ON THE RICHTER SCALE ROCKED THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL TODAY AT 1008 LOCAL , BUT THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF INJURIES OR PROPERTY DAMAGE. A SPOKESMAN FROM THE SEISMOLOGY DEPARTMENT OF EL SALVADOR SAID THE EPICENTER WAS LOCATED SOME 115 KM SOUTHEAST OF THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL, IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN, AT A DEPTH OF 50 KM. THE SOURCE TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT SO FAR THIS MONTH 78 TREMORS HAVE BEEN RECORDED IN EL SALVADOR, BUT ONLY TODAY'S QUAKE WAS FELT BY THE POPULATION. THE SERIES OF QUAKES IS THE RESULT OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE "COCO" AND THE "CARIBBEAN" PLATES, THE SPOKESMAN ADDED. HE SAID THE MOVEMENT WAS "NORMAL." IN OCTOBER 1986, AN EARTHQUAKE DESTROYED A LARGE SECTION OF THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL AND NEARLY 1,000 PEOPLE WERE KILLED.
DEV-MUC3-1276	LHASA , 7 MAY 90 -- ECUADORAN FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER CORDOVEZ, MADAME CORDOVEZ, AND FOUR OTHER ECUADORAN OFFICIALS ARRIVED IN LLASA ON THE MORNING OF 5 MAY. AT 1830 THE SAME DAY, PUQUANG, VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE TIBET AUTONOMOUS REGIONAL PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT, MET WITH THE ECUADORAN VISITORS AT THE TIBETAN-STYLE MEETING ROOM AT THE HOLIDAY INN IN LHASA. IN A FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE, VICE CHAIRMAN PUQUANG BRIEFED FOREIGN MINISTER CORDOVEZ ON TIBET'S AGRICULTURE, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY, INDUSTRY, ENERGY, AND COMMUNICATIONS; AND ESPECIALLY THE SUCCESSES TIBET HAS ACHIEVED IN VARIOUS FIELDS UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CENTRAL PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT SINCE TIBET'S DEMOCRATIC REFORM. ON BEHALF OF THE TIBETAN AUTONOMOUS REGIONAL PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT, VICE CHAIRMAN PUQUANG PRESENTED GIFTS TO THE VISITORS. THEN, VICE CHAIRMAN PUQUANG HOSTED A DINNER IN HONOR OF THE ECUADORAN VISITORS. MAKING HIS WELCOMING SPEECH, VICE CHAIRMAN PUQUANG SAID: YOUR EXCELLENCY MINISTER CORDOVEZ HAS VISITED CHINA MANY TIMES AND YOU HAVE CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF FRIENDLY RELATIONS BETWEEN CHINA AND ECUADOR AND THE PEOPLES OF THE TWO COUNTRIES. YOUR EXCELLENCY'S CURRENT VISIT TO TIBET WILL CERTAINLY ENABLE YOU TO UNDERSTAND CHINA BETTER. VICE CHAIRMAN PUQUANG STRESSED: TIBET HAS ALWAYS BEEN CHINA'S SACRED TERRITORY SINCE THE MIDDLE OF THE 13TH CENTURY. IT IS A FACT ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE WHOLE WORLD THAT ALL PREVIOUS CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS EFFECTIVELY EXERCISED THEIR SOVEREIGNTY IN TIBET. VICE CHAIRMAN PUQUANG ALSO SAID THAT, SINCE THE LIFTING THE MARTIAL LAW ORDER IN LHASA, TIBET'S SITUATION HAS BEEN STABLE, ITS PUBLIC ORDER HAS BEEN NORMAL, ITS ECONOMY HAS BEEN DEVELOPING STEADILY, AND THE PEOPLE HAS BEEN LIVING AND WORKING IN PEACE AND CONTENTMENT. MAKING HIS EXTEMPORANTEOUSLY SPEECH AT THE DINNER, FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER CORDOVEZ SAID: VISITING THE TIBETAN AUTONOMOUS REGION HAS BEEN MY DREAM FOR MANY YEARS. LIKE TIBET, ECUADOR IS A COUNTRY ON A PLATEAU. WHEN I SET FOOT IN BEAUTIFUL LHASA, I HAD THE FEELING THAT I HAD RETURNED TO MY HOMETOWN. MINISTER CORDOVEZ WHOLEHEARTEDLY WISHED TIBET PROSPERITY IN ALL FIELDS AND THE TIBETAN PEOPLE HAPPINESS.
DEV-MUC3-1277	SAN SALVADOR, 7 MAY 90 -- DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL RAFAEL HUMBERTO LARIOS STATED TODAY THAT THE OFFICERS WHO COULD SERVE AS WITNESSES IN THE CASE OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS ASSASSINATED AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY ARE TAKING TRAINING COURSES ABROAD. HE DENIED THE OFFICERS LEFT FOR REASONS OTHER FOR THE STRICTLY MILITARY NEED OF TRAINING. IF THE JUDGE SO ASKS FOR IT, THEY MAY RETURN TO GIVE THEIR STATEMENT ON THE JESUITS' CASE, HE SAID. WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE LOSS OF THE REGISTRY RECORDING THE ENTRY AND DEPARTURE OF PERSONS FROM THE MILITARY ACADEMY, GEN. LARIOS SAID HE WAS NOT AWARE OF THIS. THE CADETS ARE NOW OUT OF THE COUNTRY. THIS IS IN LINE WITH A PROGRAM PLANNED WELL IN ADVANCE. CADETS OF CERTAIN CLASSES LEAVE TO CONDUCT STUDIES, CHIEFLY IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS IS NORMAL, AS IT CORRESPONDS TO A SCHEDULED PLAN. THEY WILL HAVE TO RETURN AT SOME POINT WHEN THEY CONCLUDE THEIR STUDIES IN THE UNITED STATES. THEN WE WILL HAVE THE TIME AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY ANY ASPECT OF THIS MATTER. COULD NOT THE JUDGE CALL THEM EARLIER? IF THE JUDGE DEEMS THEIR PRESENCE ADVISABLE, THEY MAY BE CALLED IMMEDIATELY. REFERRING TO THE ENTRY AND DEPARTURE REGISTRY OF THE DAY WHEN THE JESUITS WERE KILLED, HOW WILL THIS SITUATION END UP? SO FAR, I CANNOT COMMENT ON THE MATTER. I AM NOT AWARE OF THE SITUATION. WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED. GEN. LARIOS FEELS THAT THE JESUITS' CASE HAS HAD A GREAT BEARING ON THE CONDITIONS PLACED ON THE MILITARY AID THE U.S. SENATE WILL APPROVE. THE MILITARY CHIEF REGRETTED IT IS NOT UP TO THE SALVADORAN ARMY TO SAY WHEN THE AID MUST BE CUT. THE U.S. LAWMAKERS HAVE THEIR MEANS AND CRITERIA TO DECIDE WHEN TO CUT AID, HE SAID REFERRING TO THE DECISION BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION HAS SAID IT WILL CUT MILITARY AID BY 50 PERCENT IF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT TRY THE PERSONS GUILTY OF MURDERING SIX JESUITS AND TWO OTHERS. THE AID WILL BE CUT IF THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT DOES NOT TRY TO OBTAIN SPECIFIC AGREEMENTS IN THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GUERRILLAS. WE ALL KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN REGARDING THE MILITARY AID. UNFORTUNATELY, WE MUST ADMIT WE CANNOT DECIDE THE TERMS UNDER WHICH WE WILL RECEIVE THAT MILITARY AID. THEY MUST DO THAT. THEY WILL DECIDE WHEN AND BY HOW MUCH THAT AID WILL BE CUT. GENERAL, DO YOU THINK THAT THE 60 MINUTES PROGRAM IN WHICH COL.OCHOA PEREZ PARTICIPATED WAS INFLUENTIAL IN THE DECISION TO ASK THE THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO CUT THE AID? I THINK THAT IT HAS DEFINITELY BEEN INFLUENTIAL. WE MUST UNDOUBTEDLY RECOGNIZE THIS. NEVERTHELESS, THAT IS NOT ALL. I BELIEVE THAT THE SITUATION EXISTED EVEN BEFORE THE 60 MINUTES PROGRAM WAS BROADCAST. THEREFORE, I BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEM EXISTED REGARDLESS OF WHAT WAS SAID DURING THE 60 MINUTES PROGRAM, AND WE WERE . WHAT WERE THE ISSUES WHICH HAD ALREADY DETERMINED THIS? WHAT COULD THEY BE? THAT IS REALLY NOTHING NEW. THE JESUITS' CASE HAS BEEN, LET US SAY, THE DECISIVE FACTOR FOR DECIDING ONE THING OR ANOTHER IN THE U.S. CONGRESS, SENATE, AND ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THE MILITARY AID. THAT IS BASICALLY THE ISSUE. GEN. LARIOS ALSO TALKED ABOUT POSSIBLE CHANGES WHICH MIGHT OCCUR IN THE ARMY LEADERSHIP. RECENT RUMORS INDICATE THAT HE MIGHT LEAVE HIS POST AS DEFENSE MINISTER, AND THAT CHANGES MIGHT OCCUR WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND. HE SAID THAT HE DOES NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THESE CHANGES MAY OCCUR, BUT HE TERMED THEM AS ROUTINE. REFERRING TO A U.S. TELEVISION PROGRAM WHICH IMPLIED COLONEL ORLANDO ZEPEDA'S PARTICIPATION IN THE JESUITS' CASE, THE DEFENSE MINISTER SAID HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION BECAUSE THE DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTER IS A COLLEAGUE WHO ONLY HANDLES ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES WITHIN THE ARMY.

RIO DE JANEIRO DAILY JORNAL DO BRASIL NOTES ON 17 APRIL THAT THE FEDERAL POLICE DEPARTMENT IS INVESTIGATING CHARGES THAT FEDERAL POLICE ARE INVOLVED IN DRUG SMUGGLING AND TRAFFICKING IN CORUMBA AND LADARIO. TRAFFICKING IN THE REGION HAS INCREASED STEADILY IN RECENT YEARS DUE TO THE PROXIMITY TO BOLIVIAN TOWNS INCLUDED IN THE ROUTE USED BY INTERNATIONAL TRAFFICKING RINGS, ACCORDING TO THE PAPER. ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THE FEDERAL POLICE IN MATO GROSSO DO SUL, DPF LEGAL COORDINATOR MARIO CASSIANO DUTRA SAID THAT IN FEBRUARY ALONE, FOUR INVESTIGATIONS WERE OPENED INTO CHARGES OF POLICE INVOLVEMENT IN DRUG AND ARMS TRAFFICKING AND BRIBERY, AN ADDITIONAL 12 WERE CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS, AND ANOTHER FIVE ONLY NEEDED DOCUMENTS IN ORDER TO BE CONCLUDED. TO COMBAT THE GROWING NARCOTICS PROBLEM IN THE STATE CAPITAL OF CORUMBA, ON 11 APRIL LOCAL STATION RADIO CLUBE DE CORUMBA LAUNCHED AN ANTIDRUG CAMPAIGN.

DEV-MUC3-1279	BOGOTA, 10 MAY 90 -- THE COLOMBIAN SUPREME COURT TODAY DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL THE REGISTRATION OF FIVE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES FOR THE UPCOMING 27 MAY ELECTIONS. THE MEASURE ESPECIALLY AFFECTS ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, CANDIDATE OF THE FORMER 19 APRIL GUERRILLA MOVEMENT, WHO REPLACED CARLOS PIZARRO LEON-GOMEZ, WHO WAS ASSASSINATED LAST MONTH WHILE HE WAS ABOARD A FLIGHT, AS M-19 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. THE SUPREME COURT, WHICH HAS PRONOUNCED ITSELF ON THE DECREES AND LAWS PROMULGATED BY THE LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE BRANCHES, DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL A DECREE ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS WHICH ELIMINATED THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR PERSONS TO REGISTER AS PRESIDENTIAL CANDDIDATES. THE DECREE WAS ISSUED UNDER THE STATE OF SIEGE THAT HAS EXISTED FOR THE PAST SIX YEARS. THE GOVERNMENT DECREE WAS ISSUED TO FAVOR PIZARRO LEON-GOMEZ, WHO ENTERED THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE AFTER A PEACE PROCESS WHEREBY THE M-19 DEMOBILIZED AND ABANDONED THE ARMED STRUGGLE. ALSO AFFECTED ARE CANDIDATES GUILLERMO ALEMAN, POPULAR SINGER AND CUMBIA COMPOSER MARIO GARENA, JAIRO RODRIGUEZ LEON, AND HENRY FARFAN SILVA, WHO HAD ALREADY RESIGNED, ALTHOUGH NONE OF THEM HAD ANY CHANCE OF WINNING. ACCORDING TO THE SUPREME COURT, THE STATE OF SIEGE MUST ONLY BE CONSIDERED WHEN ISSUING DECREES DEALING WITH THE RESTORING OF PUBLIC ORDER, WHICH DOES NOT CONTEMPLATE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. THE COLOMBIAN LAWS DEMAND THAT A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MUST BE OR HAS BEEN A PARLIAMENTARIAN, UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR, AMBASSADOR, OR ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND HAS BEEN A PROFESSIONAL FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS. NONETHELESS, THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION IS NOT RETROACTIVE AND THE CANDIDACIES WILL BE WITHDRAWN ONLY IF THEY ARE OFFICIALLY CHALLENGED.
DEV-MUC3-1280	PANAMA CITY , 10 MAY 90 -- THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY SALUTES THE HONORABLE FOREIGN MINISTRY AND IN REFERENCE TO NOTE NO. A.J.122 FROM THAT MINISTRY IS PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE HAVE DULY ACKNOWLEDGED NOTE DPG 1794 OF 30 APRIL 1990 FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, THROUGH WHICH THIS EMBASSY HAS BEEN INFORMED THAT OUR REFUGEE GONZALO GONZALEZ RIVERA IS ACCUSED OF BEING THE MASTERMIND OF CHILD MARCOS ALBERTO RODRIGUEZ JUSTINES' MURDER ACCORDING TO CANCIO CIACCI TASON'S STATEMENTS. IN THIS REGARD, THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY REITERATES THAT, THROUGH NOTE NO.5-20-M/002 DATED 8 JANUARY 1990, IT NOTIFIED THE PANAMANIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY THAT DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM HAD BEEN GRANTED TO 12 PERSONS WHO CAME TO THIS MISSION'S RESIDENCE, INCLUDING FORMER DEFENSE FORCES MAJOR GONZALO GONZALEZ RIVERA, AND REQUESTED THAT SAFE-CONDUCTS BE GRANTED FOR THEM TO TRAVEL ABROAD. WE MIGHT STRESS THAT SUCH GRANTING OF ASYLUM AND REQUESTING SAFE-CONDUCTS, AS WAS INDICATED IN THIS EMBASSY'S NOTE NO.5-20-/M-027 DATED 2 MARCH 1990, WAS BASED ON THE QUALIFICATION GRANTED TO THIS EMBASSY AS THE STATE GRANTING THE ASYLUM ACCORDING TO THE CONVENTION ON DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM SIGNED IN CARACAS IN MARCH 1954. THEREFORE, THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT CANNOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION ANY ACTIONS OF WHICH THE REFUGEE MAY BE ACCUSED, OR ANY LEGAL SITUATION THAT MAY PREVAIL AFTER THE SUBJECT HAS BEEN GRANTED ASYLUM. HOWEVER, AND WITHOUT GOING AGAINST WHAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY STATED, THE REFUGEE GONZALO GONZALEZ IS WILLING TO RENDER TESTIMONY BEFORE AN AUTHORIZED LEGAL OFFICIAL SO AS TO CLARIFY HIS SITUATION. THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY WILL ALLOW THAT OFFICIAL TO ENTER THE PREMISES OF THE EMBASSY FOR THIS PURPOSE. AT THIS TIME, THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY, BASED ON THE CLEAR DISPOSITIONS OF THE CARACAS CONVENTION ON DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM -- THE INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT IN EFFECT BETWEEN PANAMA AND PERU -- REITERATES ONCE AGAIN THE REQUEST FOR A SAFE-CONDUCT FOR THE AFOREMENTIONED REFUGEE. THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY AVAILS ITSELF OF THIS OPPORTUNITY TO REAFFIRM ITS HIGHEST AND MOST DISTINGUISHED CONSIDERATION TO THE HONORABLE FOREIGN MINISTRY. PANAMA, 7 MAY 1990
DEV-MUC3-1281	BRIDGETOWN , 13 MAY 90 -- ST. JOHN'S, ANTIGUA, MAY 13, CANA -- BRITISH LAWYER LOUIS BLOM COOPER WAS PREPARING TO HEAD BACK TO LONDON SUNDAY AFTER DISCUSSIONS HERE ON A JUDICIAL INQUIRY INTO A 1989 ARMS SHIPMENT THROUGH ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA. THE QUEEN'S COUNSEL ARRIVED HERE FOR TALKS WITH GOVERNOR GENERAL SIR WILFRED JACOBS AND ATTORNEY GENERAL FORDE ON THE ILLEGAL ARMS SHIPMENT THAT ENDED UP IN THE HANDS OF COLOMBIAN DRUG DEALERS. THE PROBE, SAID CANARADIO, WILL BEGIN IN TWO MONTHS. IN IDENTIFYING THE BRITON TO HEAD THE INVESTIGATION, THE CABINET HERE DESCRIBED HIM AS A RESPECTED JURIST WITH EXPERIENCE IN CONDUCTING COMMISSIONS OF ENQUIRY. BLOM COOPER CONDUCTED A COMMISSION OF ENQUIRY INTO ARSON, CORRUPTION, AND OTHER RELATED MATTERS IN THE TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS IN 1986. ISRAEL SAYS IT SOLD THE ARMS TO THE ANTIGUA GOVERNMENT, BUT ST. JOHN'S DENIES THIS. THE ISRAELIS HAVE IMPLICATED AN ANTIGUAN MINISTER, VERE BIRD JR. IN THE SCANDAL, BUT BIRD SAYS HE HAD NO LINKS WITH THE ARMS. MEANWHILE, ISRAEL ON SUNDAY CALLED COLOMBIAN DIPLOMATIC SANCTIONS OVER THE SALES OF ISRAELI ARMS TO DRUG TRAFFICKERS UNJUSTIFIED AND SAID IT WAS WORKING TO END THE ROW. AFTER COLOMBIAN POLICE FOUND HUNDREDS OF ISRAELI-MADE GUNS ON THE FARM OF A DEAD DRUG BARON, BOGOTA SAID ON FRIDAY IT WAS REVOKING 1962 AND 1966 AGREEMENTS ALLOWING ISRAELIS TO VISIT WITHOUT VISAS. "WE REGRET THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT DECISION, WHICH WE THINK IS NEITHER RIGHT NOR JUSTIFIED. WE WILL REMAIN IN CONTACT WITH THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE," AN ISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN TOLD REUTERS. BOGOTA HAS ALSO ACCUSED ISRAELI AND BRITISH MERCENARIES OF HELPING DRUG TRAFFICKERS TRAIN PRIVATE ARMIES BLAMED FOR KILLING CIVILIANS IN NORTHERN COLOMBIA. ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA'S FINANCE MINISTER JOHN ST. LUCE HAS MET WITH AND APPRISED THE HEADS OF THE COUNTRY'S TEN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OF GOVERNMENT'S PROGRESS IN SETTING UP THE JUDICIAL ENQUIRY, A STATEMENT FROM THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE SAID. "I'M AWARE THAT ALL BANK MANAGERS NEED TO KEEP THEIR HEAD OFFICES AND, OR DIRECTORS ABREAST OF DEVELOPMENTS," ST. LUCE WAS QUOTED AS SAYING. THE MINISTER ASKED THE BANKS TO "BE OBJECTIVE AND ALLOW THE JUDICIAL INQUIRY TO DETERMINE WHAT REALLY TRANSPIRED AND TO INFORM THE COUNTRY AS TO WHO ARE THE PERSONS INVOLVED." THE STATEMENT SAID THE BANK MANAGERS "EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR MR. ST. LUCE'S FRANKNESS AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR DISCUSSION."

THIS STRUGGLE IS NOTHING BUT THE RESULTS OF THE EFFORTS EXERTED MY MANY REPORTERS LIKE YOU, WHO HAVE HELPED US SO SELFLESSLY AND WHO HAVE NOT TRIED TO WITHHOLD THE INFORMATION. I BELIEVE THAT THIS DESERVES PRAISE AND I AM GRATEFUL FOR THIS. IN REGARD TO WHAT WE WILL SAY TOMORROW, WE WILL PROVE TO THE COUNTRY THAT THE SO-CALLED HUMAN FAILURE IS A LIE. SECOND, WE WILL PROVE HOW THE CIA ACTS ON THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL; WHO ITS AGENTS ARE IN ECUADOR AND THEIR NAMES; AND WHAT CAUSED THE PRESIDENTIAL PLANE CRASH, WHICH WE HAVE TERMED A HOMICIDE. WE WILL TELL THE COUNTRY WHO THE MAIN POLITICAL CONSPIRATOR WAS AGAINST PRESIDENT ROLDOS. WE WILL PROVE THIS WITH DOCUMENTS BECAUSE WE WILL NOT BE TALKING ABOUT . WE WILL REVEAL WHAT THIS POLITICAL CONSPIRATOR SAID BEFORE THE PRESIDENT'S DEATH AND AFTER HIS ASSASSINATION.
DEV-MUC3-1283	SANTIAGO, 15 MAY 90 -- AT LEAST SIX BOMBS EXPLODED IN VARIOUS PLACES IN THE CAPITAL DURING THE NIGHT. ONE INDIVIDUAL WAS INJURED. THE DAMAGES WERE DIFFERENT IN EACH CASE. ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS INCIDENTS OCCURRED IN THE AREA OF THE U.S. CONSULATE, IN FRONT OF FORESTAL PARK AND THE PURISIMA BRIDGE. HERE, UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS THREW A BOMB ONTO THE DIPLOMATIC PREMISES, INJURING A GUARD NAMED BARROSO, WHO WAS TAKEN TO THE CENTRAL HOSPITAL. THE SERIES OF BOMBINGS BEGAN WHEN AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THREW A BOMB INTO THE DEFENSE MINISTRY'S PARKING LOT, LOCATED OFF AN ALLEY BETWEEN ALAMEDA AND ALONSO VALLE STREETS. TWO CARS WERE DAMAGED BUT NO ONE WAS INJURED. OTHER BOMBS EXPLODED ON BANDERA AND ALAMEDA STREETS, AND NEAR AN AUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORT FIRM ON TARAPACA AND SANTA ROSA STREETS. ANOTHER BOMB EXPLODED ON THAT CORNER A FEW WEEKS AGO. THE OTHER BOMBS DAMAGED AN ISRAELI COMMUNITY OFFICE AT SERRANO AND TARAPACA STREETS, A FRUIT EXPORTING FIRM AT ELIODORO YANEZ AND GENERAL SALVO STREETS IN PROVIDENCIA, AND A MORMON CHURCH AT PEDRO DE VALDIVIA AND OCURO STREETS.
DEV-MUC3-1284	LIMA, 14 MAY 90 -- THE PERUVIAN POLICE, AND PARTS OF THE ARMY, HAVE RECEIVED ORDERS OF "STRICT CONFINEMENT TO BARRACKS" IN VIEW OF THE 17 MAY ANNIVERSARY OF THE TERRORIST ORGANIZATION SHINING PATH. THE ORGANIZATION HAS ANNOUNCED IT WILL CELEBRATE ITS 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH AN INCREASE IN ARMED OPERATIONS. PERUVIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THE GROUP THAT REBELLED ON 17 MAY 1980 HAS DEVISED "A CELEBRATIONS PLAN" AND THAT IT INTENDS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN AS "A SIGN OF VICTORY" IN THE "STRUGGLE OF MOVEMENTS," AN IDEOLOGY INSPIRED IN MAO ZEDONG'S DOCTRINE. ARMY PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN CONFINED TO BARRACKS SINCE THE NIGHT OF 12 MAY AND HAVE ALREADY PARTICIPATED ON JOINT OPERATIONS WITH THE POLICE TO ARREST 500 ALLEGED TERRORISTS. IN LIMA, 8,000 POLICE AGENTS AND A SPECIAL ANTIEXPLOSIVES SQUAD LAUNCHED "A GIGANTIC OPERATION" OF "BLOCKADES AND SATURATION." A POLICE SPOKESMAN TOLD EFE THAT THEY HAD ORDERS "TO CAREFULLY COMB THE NEW URBAN AREAS AND SEARCH FOR SUSPECTED CRIMINALS, ARMS, EXPLOSIVES, OR SUBVERSIVE MATERIAL." ACCORDING TO THE SPOKESMAN, THE LIMA POLICE DEPARTMENT HEADED BY GENERAL OSVALDO DIAZ HAS ORDERS "TO WATCH ROADS ENTERING THE CITY, TO INSTALL EMERGENCY CHECK POINTS IN STRATEGIC LOCATIONS, AND TO REPORT ON ANYTHING UNUSUAL." ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SOURCES, THE OPERATION WILL CONTINUE UNTIL AFTER THE RUNOFF ELECTION, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE HELD ON 10 JUNE. THE POLICE HAVE LAUNCHED SIMILAR OPERATIONS IN REGIONS WHERE GUERRILLA ACTIVITY IS RAMPANT SUCH AS AYACUCHO, PUNO, HUANCAYO, AND HUANCAVELICA IN THE PERUVIAN CENTRAL HIGHLANDS. THESE REGIONS ARE ALL UNDER STATES OF EMERGENCY AND UNDER MILITARY CONTROL. SHINING PATH, CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST IMPENETRABLE AND ORTHODOX ARMED MOVEMENTS IN LATIN AMERICA, BEGAN CELEBRATING ITS ANNIVERSARY IN LIMA LAST WEEK BY BURNING 11 STATE TRANSPORT COMPANY BUSES. THE BUSES WERE ATTACKED BY HOODED INDIVIDUALS THOUGHT TO BE SHINING PATH MILITANTS. ON 11 MAY A BOMB DESTROYED A BUILDING OWNED BY THE FAMILY OF THE MAYOR OF LIMA. IN ANOTHER INCIDENT IN LIMA TODAY, POLICE CORPORAL OSWALDO PALOMINO, WHO SERVED IN AYACUCHO UNTIL A SHORT TIME AGO, WAS SHOT TO DEATH. IN AYACUCHO, WHERE THE THE COMUNIST PARTY OF PERU -- "OFFICIAL" NAME OF SHINING PATH -- WAS BORN AND DEVELOPED, TWO PEOPLE WERE MURDERED, AND VARIOUS HOME-MADE BOMBS EXPLODED IN IN THE LAST 24 HOURS. COUNCILMEN JUAN MANUEL GARABITO FROM PIURA, 1,100 KM NORTH OF LIMA, HAS ALSO BEEN SHOT TO DEATH. AUTHORITIES BLAMED SHINING PATH FOR THESE ATTACKS. OBSERVERS OF THE PERUVIAN GUERRILLA MOVEMENT TOLD EFE THAT THE GROWING TIDE OF VIOLENCE ATTIBUTED TO SHINING PATH INDICATES THAT THE RADICAL, OR "RED" SECTOR, OF THE REBEL GROUP HAS TAKEN CONTROL OF THE ORGANIZATION. ACCORDING TO THE SOURCES, TWO DIFFERENT FACTIONS WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION CLASHED OVER THE CELEBRATION OF THE GROUP'S ANNIVERSARY: THE YOUNGER AND RADICAL SECTORS FAVORED PURELY MILITARY OPERATIONS WHILE THE OLDER SECTOR, OR "BLACKS," FAVORED MORE POLITICAL AND HISTORIC ACTIVITIES. SHINING PATH, WHICH OFFICIALLY OPERATES WITH APPROXIMATELY 5,000 ARMED MEN, HAS CAUSED THE DEATH OF 20,000 PEOPLE, INCLUDING 7,000 CIVILIANS, AND IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR $17 BILLION IN DIRECT DAMAGES TO THE COUNTRY OVER ITS 10 YEAR HISTORY.
DEV-MUC3-1285	GUATEMALA CITY, 16 MAY 90 -- GOVERNMENT SOURCES ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THREE POLICEMEN FROM THE GUATEMALA POLICE IDENTIFICATION DEPARTMENT WERE KILLED BY GUERRILLAS OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. POLICE SPOKESMEN SAID THAT POLICEMEN HUMBERTO DIAZ, A DRIVER; EDGAR CORONADO, A PHOTOGRAPHER; AND MARIO NAVARRO, A TECHNICAL SERGEANT, WERE AMBUSHED LAST NIGHT BY GUERRILLAS AT THE SAN ISIDRO FARM, 99 KM SOUTH OF THE CAPITAL. THE POLICEMEN WERE ON THE WAY BACK FROM INVESTIGATING THE BURNING OF FIVE BUSES BY REBELS LAST WEEK AND WERE PRESUMABLY KILLED BY GUERRILLAS FROM THE REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION OF THE PEOPLE IN ARMS . MEANWHILE, AMALIO ESCOBAR MONZON, 21, A MEMBER OF THE CIVIL SELF-DEFENSE PATROLS , WAS SHOT TO DEATH IN SAN PABLO, SAN MARCOS DEPARTMENT, IN THE NORTHWESTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. OFFICIAL SOURCES SAID THAT YESTERDAY ARMED MEN BROKE INTO MONZON'S RESIDENCE AND KILLED HIM. IN SOLOLA DEPARTMENT, ALSO IN THE NORTHWESTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY, OTHER INSURGENT GROUPS OCCUPIED STRETCHES OF HIGHWAY AND DEMANDED THAT TRAVELERS SURRENDER THEIR MONEY AND BELONGINGS. THESE INSURGENT ACTIONS HAVE TAKEN PLACE LESS THAN TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE DIALOGUE THAT WILL BE HELD IN SPAIN BETWEEN GUERRILLA DELEGATES AND THE GUATEMALAN POLITICAL PARTIES TO AGREE ON A POSSIBLE CEASE-FIRE AND TO END 30 YEARS OF INTERNAL STRIFE. THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY , WHICH INCLUDES THE ORPA AND OTHER INSURGENT MOVEMENTS, HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE TALKS BUT IN THE MEANTIME WILL CONTINUE ITS ARMED STRUGGLE.
DEV-MUC3-1286	GUATEMALA CITY, 16 MAY 90 -- TERRORIST ACTIONS WERE REPORTED TONIGHT SOUTH OF GUATEMALA CITY, A FEW HOURS AFTER A MASS TRANSIT BUS AND SEVERAL TIRES WERE BURNED IN OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY. TWO EXPLOSIONS TOOK PLACE IN A VACANT LOT AT APPROXIMATELY 2120 ON 15TH AVENUE AND 6TH STREET, ZONE 13. ACCORDING TO PERSONS WHO WERE NEARBY AT THAT TIME, SHOOTING WAS HEARD BEFORE THE EXPLOSIONS. A FEW MINUTES LATER, DEVICES, BELIEVED TO BE FRAGMENTATION GRENADES, WENT OFF. THE SHOCK WAVE CREATED BY THE BLAST SHATTERED THE WINDOWS OF HOUSE NUMBER 729 AND BUILDING 626, LOCATED IN FRONT OF THE VACANT LOT. THE EXPLOSION PROMPTED THE QUICK MOBILIZATION OF FIREMEN, POLICEMEN, AND SEVERAL ARMY ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS FROM LA AURORA MILITARY BASE. SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE SPECIAL ORANGE EXPLOSIVE SQUAD ALSO ARRIVED TO DEFUSE ANOTHER DEVICE LEFT IN THE AREA. AT FIRST, IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE HOME CLOSE TO THE SITE OF THE EXPLOSION BELONGEDTO NEWSMAN ALVARO CONTRERAS VELEZ. WE WERE NOT ABLE TO VERIFY THIS REPORT. WE JUST LEARNED THAT A FAMILY BY THE NAME OF DIAZ NAVARRO LIVES THERE. THERE WERE NO FATALITIES, BUT DAMAGE TO THE BUILDINGS ARE REPORTED. NEWSMAN CONTRERAS VELEZ, PRENSA LIBRE EDITOR AND AUTHOR OF THE "CACTO" COLUMN, CAME TO THE AREA TO OBSERVE THE DAMAGE. IT WAS UNOFFICIALLY ESTABLISHED THAT SOME GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS LIVE IN THIS SECTOR. MUNICIPAL FIREMEN HELPED POLICE AUTHORITIES IN COMBING THE AREA AFTER THE EXPLOSIONS. THE RUMOR THAT A CAR BOMB EXPLODED ON 7TH AVENUE AND 7TH STREET, ZONE 9, CIRCULATED ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY. LATER, IT WAS LEARNED THAT THE EXPLOSION WAS CAUSED BY A BOOBY TRAP. THE AUTHORITIES ARE ON ALERT AND STEPPED UP OPERATIONS, A POLICE SPOKESMAN SAID. AGAIN AT 2230 TONIGHT, NATIONAL POLICE EXPLOSIVE EXPERTS DISCOVERED ANOTHER DEVICE IN THE VACANT LOT WHERE TWO OTHER BOMBS HAD GONE OFF EARLIER. TEN HOMES WERE DAMAGED BY ONE OF THE EXPLOSIONS, INCLUDING THE HOMES OF DEPUTY FINANCES MINISTER GUSTAVO ADOLFO LEIVA AND GUATEMALA GOVERNOR MARIO LOGORGON. ONLY MATERIAL DAMAGE WAS CAUSED. THE AREA RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN EVACUATED FROM THE SITE. ANOTHER CHARGE WENT OFF IN FRONT OF THE AIR FORCE'S MAIN GATE ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME THE FIRST BOMB WENT OFF. AIR FORCE OFFICIALS CLOSED HINCAPIE AVENUE, FROM LIBERACION BOULEVARD TO SANTA FE. THE OFFICERS REPORTED MATERIAL DAMAGE AND AND AN EXCHANGE OF FIRE IN THE AREA NEARBY. FIREMEN AND POLICEMEN AND SEVERAL ARMY ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS PATROLLING THE CITY ARE MAINTANING SECURITY.
DEV-MUC3-1287	TEL AVIV , 17 MAY 90 -- WHEN HE BEGAN HIS JOB AS GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT AFTER DECADES OF MILITARY REGIMES THAT LEFT BEHIND 100,000 FATALITIES, CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT MARCO VINICIO AREVALO CEREZO HAD PROMISES FOR THE FUTURE AND THINGS TO HIS CREDIT IN THE PAST. THE THINGS TO HIS CREDIT WERE FOUR ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS ON HIM BECAUSE OF HIS ATTEMPTS TO RESTORE DEMOCRACY IN HIS COUNTRY, AND HIS PROMISES WERE TO STOP POLITICAL VIOLENCE, CORRUPTION, AND MAINLY THE ACTIVITIES OF THE EXTREME RIGHT-WING DEATH SQUADS. CEREZO HAS BEEN IN THIS POST FOR FIVE YEARS. NEW ELECTIONS ARE TO BE HELD SOON, AND THE ACTIVITIES OF THE DEATH SQUADS, SUPPORTED BY ELEMENTS IN THE DEFENSE FORCES, HAVE NOT STOPPED. THEY KILLED HUNDREDS OF LABOR UNION LEADERS AND LEFTISTS. THE VISIT TO ISRAEL BY GUATEMALAN FOREIGN MINISTER ARIEL IRIAS RIVERA PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN HIS COUNTRY. AFTER ALL, NO ONE AT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY HAS EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN IT. BEFORE YOU CAME HERE, YOU SAID THAT YOU INTEND TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION HERE FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE IN BRINGING PEACE TO CENTRAL AMERICA. WHAT CAN THE MIDDLE EAST LEARN FROM CENTRAL AMERICA? YOU CAN LEARN THAT PROBLEMS CAN BE SOLVED WITHOUT VIOLENCE, THAT INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND GUARANTEES ARE IMPORTANT. IT SEEMS TO US THAT THE PROPOSITION TO HOLD AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IS THE ONE THAT EVENTUALLY WILL BRING PEACE TO YOUR AREA. AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE AWARE OF THE LARGE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SITUATION IN OUR REGION, WHERE ALL THE PEOPLES HAVE THE SAME ORIGIN, AND YOURS, WHERE NATIONAL, COMMUNITY, AND RELIGIOUS CONFLICTS ARE INTERTWINED. IT WAS SAID IN JERUSALEM THAT YOU HAVE NOT COME HERE TO PURCHASE MILITARY EQUIPMENT. THAT SORT OF CLARIFICATION DOES NOT USUALLY PRECEDE A VISIT BY A FOREIGN MINISTER TO ISRAEL. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY WANTED TO CLARIFY AN ISSUE THAT IS SELF-EVIDENT FOR US. WITH US, WEAPON DEALS ARE CARRIED OUT BY MILITARY PERSONNEL. THE ISRAELI CHAPTER OF AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL WANTED TO PRESENT YOU WITH A PETITION SIGNED BY HUNDREDS OF ISRAELIS DEMANDING THAT HUMAN RIGHTS' ABUSE IN GUATEMALA IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS BE INVESTIGATED. I HAVE A DEEP RESPECT FOR AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, BUT WE FEEL IT IS OUTDATED TO USE TOOLS FROM A DICTATORIAL PAST ON PRESENT REGIMES. IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT HAS A POLICY THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM ITS PREDECESSORS'. NEVERTHELESS, THERE STILL ARE CENTERS OF RIGHT-WING POWER IN OUR COUNTRY; THOSE GROUPS FEAR THE STABILIZATION OF DEMOCRACY. CEREZO PROMISED TO INVESTIGATE ISRAELI INVOLVEMENT IN GUATEMALA, INCLUDING ARMS AND DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY SALES. HAS ANYTHING BEEN DONE IN THAT RESPECT? FROM WHAT I KNOW, ISRAEL SOLD WEAPONS TO GUATEMALA AT THE FULL PRICE WHEN THE U.S. BOYCOTT WAS IN EFFECT AND OUR ARMY NEEDED MILITARY EQUIPMENT TO FIGHT THE GUERRILLAS. OTHER THAN THAT, OUR DECISION IS NOT TO SCRATCH THE WOUNDS OF THE PAST, BUT TO WORRY ABOUT PEACE IN THE FUTURE. CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT APPEARS TO BE ONE WITH GOOD INTENTIONS, BUT WITHOUT COMPLETE CONTROL OVER THE ARMY AND THOSE CONNECTED WITH THE DEATH SQUADS. THIS IS AN INCORRECT IMAGE. I WOULD NOT SAY THAT IT IS EASY TO OVERCOME ALL THE POWER ELEMENTS IN A FEW YEARS. STILL, I CAN SAY THAT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE IN THIS FIELD. THE ARMY'S COMMAND HEADED BY GENERAL GRAMAJO MORALES, THE DEFENSE MINISTER, GREATLY ASSISTED THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIZATION. ARE THE ELEMENTS THAT TOOK PART IN THE COUPS NOT CONNECTED TO THE EXTREME RIGHT-WING AND THE DEATH SQUADS WHICH MURDERED HUNDREDS OF CITIZENS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, UNDER A DEMOCRATIC REGIME? IT IS VERY PROBABLE, BUT WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THESE ELEMENTS ARE A MINORITY, AFTER ALL. THE OFFICERS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE FIRST COUP WERE PARDONED. THE OFFICERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE SECOND COUP WERE BROUGHT TO TRIAL. I BELIEVE THIS INDICATES A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT. IN YOUR OPINION, WILL CEREZO BE ABLE TO APPEAR BEFORE THE VOTERS IN A FEW MONTHS AND PROVE THAT HE HAS KEPT HIS PROMISES? TO A LARGE EXTENT, YES. ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS BEGUN; POLITICAL AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS ALLOWED; POLITICAL LEADERS ARE NO LONGER SYSTEMATICALLY MURDERED AS IN THE PAST; AND THERE IS NO VIOLENT SUPPRESSION OF DEMOCRATIC EXPRESSIONS. CEREZO IS TRYING TO PLAY THE DEMOCRATIC GAME ALL THE WAY.
DEV-MUC3-1288	MANILA , 18 MAY 90 -- THE UNHOLY UNION OF ILLICIT DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND POLITICAL TERRORISTS HAS BECOME EVIDENT IN THE PHILIPPINES AS IN OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS PERU AND COLOMBIA, MILITARY AUTHORITIES SAID YESTERDAY. VIOLENCE FUELED BY BIG DRUG PROFITS IS VIEWED AS A MAJOR THREAT TO A NUMBER OF SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENTS, THEY ADDED. LAST MARCH, AUTHORITIES IN MANILA ARRESTED TWO NEW PEOPLE'S ARMY GUERRILLAS REPORTEDLY FROM THE ALEX BONCAYAO BRIGADE FOR TRAFFICKING IN NARCOTICS. THE ARRESTS CAME AFTER A FOUR-MONTH INVESTIGATION OF REPORTS THAT THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF THE PHILIPPINES WAS INVOLVED IN DRUG TRAFFICKING AS A MEANS TO SHORE UP RESOURCES FOR BUYING FIREARMS IN VIEW OF DECLINING DONATIONS FROM SUPPORTERS IN EUROPE. FORTY-FOUR DECKS OF SHABU WITH A STREET VALUE OF P154,000 WERE FOUND IN THE POSSESSION OF THE SUSPECTS. IN THE SAME MONTH, DRUG KINGPIN JOSE OYSON, ALSO KNOWN AS DON PEPE, WAS KILLED WHILE GRAPPLING WITH POLICE AS HE WAS BEING TAKEN TO THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION HEADQUARTERS FOR QUESTIONING. AFTER HIS ACQUITTAL FOR THE 1984 KILLING OF AN ANTI-DRUG CRUSADING MANILA NEWSPAPER REPORTER, OYSON ALLEGEDLY ESTABLISHED CONNECTIONS WITH MAJOR DRUG SYNDICATE LEADERS IN HONG KONG AND TAIWAN. HE ALSO HAD BEEN UNDER SUSPICION OF FINANCING RIGHT-WING REVOLTS AGAINST PRESIDENT AQUINO. THE ARRESTS OF THE TWO NPA GUERRILLAS PROVIDED THE FIRST HARD EVIDENCE IN THE PHILIPPINES OF THE UNHOLY ALLIANCE OF NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING AND TERRORISM THAT HAD ALREADY PLAGUED A NUMBER OF GOVERNMENTS ELSEWHERE. AUTHORITIES SAID THEY ALSO SHOWED THAT ILLICIT DRUG PROFITS CAN FUEL REVOLUTIONS FROM THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT WITH EQUAL MAGNANIMITY AND EVEN SIMULTANEOUSLY. AS A PRIME EXAMPLE, IN COLOMBIA, POWERFUL COCAINE LEADERS WHO WORKED IN CLOSE LEAGUE WITH COMMUNIST INSURGENTS 10 OR 15 YEARS AGO HAVE TURNED AGAINST THE INSURGENTS AS THEIR STAGGERING DRUG PROFITS ENABLED THEM TO BUY UP HUGE TRACTS OF RURAL FARM AND RANCH LAND AND URBAN REAL ESTATE IN THE 1980S
DEV-MUC3-1289	MADRID , 17 MAY 90 -- LIMA, 17 MAY -- SOURCES CLOSE TO THE GOVERNMENT TODAY SAID THAT THE "TEMPORARY WITHDRAWAL" FROM THE STRUGGLE ANNOUNCED BY THE "SHINING PATH" PERUVIAN MAOIST GUERRILLA GROUP ON ITS 10TH ANNIVERSARY IS A "PSYCHOLOGICAL WAR OPERATION" INITIATED BY THE MILITARY. CIVILIAN SOURCES TOLD EFE THAT THE COMMUNIQUE THAT WAS RELEASED IN AYACUCHO -- THE CRADLE OF THE "SHINING PATH" -- ANNOUNCING THE GROUP'S TEMPORARY WITHDRAWAL FROM THE ARMED STRUGGLE "IS FICTITIOUS AND WAS RELEASED BY THE ARMED FORCES TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE RANKS OF THE SHINING PATH" AT A TIME WHEN TERRORIST ACTIONS WERE EXPECTED TO INCREASE TO MARK THE GROUP'S ANNIVERSARY. THE SOURCES SAID THAT THE COMMUNIQUE IS AIMED AT CONFUSING THE SHINING PATH COMMANDOS, WHO ARE DIVIDED AND HAVE NO CLEAR COMMUNICATION AMONG THEMSELVES OR WITH THEIR COMMANDING LEVELS. THE SOURCES ADDED THAT THE COMMUNIQUE IS AIMED AT DELAYING OR ABORTING THE ARMED ACTIONS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN PLANNED FOR TODAY AND TOMORROW. THE SECURITY FORCES HAVE BEEN ON "RED ALERT" IN AYACUCHO TODAY TO PREVENT THE SHINING PATH FROM CELEBRATING ITS 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH PROPAGANDA ATTACKS RECALLING THE BEGINNING OF THE "PEOPLE'S WAR" ON 17 JUNE 1980, WHEN THE GROUP ATTACKED AN ELECTORAL COURT OFFICE IN AN ANDEAN TOWN. THE COMMUNIQUE, WHICH WAS RELEASED IN SUBURBAN AREAS OF AYACUCHO, ANNOUNCED THAT THE PERUVIAN COMMUNIST PARTY -- WHICH IS THE OFFICIAL NAME OF THE SHINING PATH -- HAS "TEMPORARILY" WITHDRAWN FROM THE ARMED STRUGGLE AND WILL REORGANIZE ITSELF TO RETURN WITH "NEW IMPETUS." THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE COMMUNIQUE WAS ALSO CALLED INTO QUESTION BY AYACUCHO JOURNALISTIC AND UNIVERSITY SOURCES CONSULTED BY EFE. THEY NOTED THAT THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT COMMUNIQUES HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE SHINING PATH. "WE ARE TEMPORARILY WITHDRAWING FORM THE ARMED STRUGGLE, BUT WE WILL CONTINUE THE IDEOLOGICAL FIGHT AND EXAMINE AND EVALUATE THE BRILLIANT ACTIONS THAT WE HAVE CARRIED OUT DURING THE PAST DECADE TO RETURN ONCE AGAIN, WITH MORE IDEAS AND A DETERMINATION THAT WILL PERMIT A STRATEGIC BALANCE UNDER BETTER CIRCUMSTANCES," THE COMMUNIQUE STATES. "IT IS TIME FOR US TO SAY THAT THE TIME FOR CRIME FOR THE SAKE OF CRIME IS PASSED AND THAT THE CULT OF PERSONALITY IS ALSO OVER," IT ADDS. CONTRARY TO STANDARD SHINING PATH PRACTICE, THE NOTE, WHICH IS SIGNED BY THE "PCP-RANK-AND-FILE," DOES NOT MENTION THE MOVEMENT'S TOP LEADER AND FOUNDER ABIMAEL GUZMAN, KNOWN BY HIS SUPPORTERS AS "PRESIDENT GONZALO." SPECIALISTS BELIEVE THAT THIS PHRASE IS AN ATTACK AGAINST THE MORE MILITARIST SECTOR OF THE SHINING PATH AND AGAINST GUZMAN, AND THAT IT SEEKS TO FOMENT DIVISION WITHIN THE SHINING PATH. SOME SPECIALISTS IN THE ACTIVITIES OF THE GROUP HAVE SAID THAT THERE IS A CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE MORE MODERATE SECTOR, KNOWN AS THE "BLACK" WING, AND THE "RED" ORTHODOX, MILITARIST WING. OTHER OBSERVERS HAVE SAID THAT THERE ARE ONLY "FISSURES" CONCERNING OPERATIONAL METHODS.
DEV-MUC3-1290	PANAMA CITY , 16 MAY 90 -- THE PRESUMED SUBVERSIVE GROUP M-20 THREATENED ON 15 MAY TO ENTER THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY AND FREE THE REFUGEES THERE. IT ALSO CALLED SEVERAL MEDIA CLAIMING THAT IT HAD KIDNAPPED A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT AND PLACED BOMBS IN SEVERAL GOVERNMENT OFFICES. IN VIEW OF THE TELEPHONE CALLS, THE GOVERNMENT, THROUGH FOREIGN MINISTER JULIO LINARES, HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS STRENGTHENED POLICE PROTECTION AROUND THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN THIS CAPITAL. FORMER PANAMA DEFENSE FORCES OFFICERS GONZALO GONZALEZ AND HERACLIDES SUCRE, CLOSE COLLABORATORS OF OVERTHROWN GENERAL MANUEL NORIEGA, ARE REFUGEES AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY. GONZALEZ IS ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED IN THE MURDER OF SEVERAL MILITARY OFFICERS WHO TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY TO OVERTHROW NORIEGA ON 3 OCTOBER 1989. FOREIGN MINISTER LINARES REVEALED THAT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY HAD RECEIVED TWO TELEPHONE CALLS FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS M-20 MEMBERS AND THREATENED TO ENTER THE EMBASSY GROUNDS TO FREE THE REFUGEES THERE. SECURITY AROUND THE EMBASSY WAS REINFORCED, ALTHOUGH IT HAD BEEN STRENGTHENED EARLIER AFTER SEVERAL OFFICERS OF THE FORMER REGIME SOUGHT ASYLUM THERE. MEANWHILE, THE DIRECTOR OF THE "INSTITUTO AMERICA" HIGH SCHOOL DENIED THE M-20'S CLAIM THAT IT WAS HOLDING, AND THREATENED TO KILL, A STUDENT FROM THAT SCHOOL. ALSO ON 15 MAY, PANAMANIAN AND AMERICAN POLICEMEN HAD TO ORDER THE EVACUATION OF WORKERS FROM SEVERAL GOVERNMENT OFFICES IN THE BANKING AREA OF VIA ESPANA DUE TO REPORTED BOMB THREATS FROM THE M- 20. THE M-20 ALLEGEDLY IS A GROUP OF SUPPORTERS OF OVERTHROWN GENERAL NORIEGA WHO CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MARCH TERRORIST ATTACK ON THE "MY PLACE" BAR. ONE U.S. SOLDIER WAS KILLED AND 20 PANAMANIANS WERE WOUNDED IN THE ATTACK. FOREIGN MINISTER LINARES SAID THAT HE COULD NOT CONFIRM THE EXISTENCE OF THE M-20. A NUMBER OF DAYS AGO THE SOUTHERN COMMAND OFFERED A $10,000 REWARD TO ANY PERSON WHO PROVIDES INFORMATION LEADING TO THE ARREST OF THE MAN WHO THREW THE BOMB INTO THE AFOREMENTIONED BAR. IT WAS ALSO LEARNED THAT THE JUDICIAL TECHNICAL POLICE ARE TRYING TO TRACE THE TELEPHONE CALLS, WHICH HAVE SCARED THE CITIZENS SOMEWHAT. MAJOR GONZALO GONZALEZ, WHO HAS TAKEN REFUGE AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY, WAS ALSO ACCUSED OF BEING THE MASTERMIND BEHIND THE DEATH OF YOUNG MELQUIADES RODRIGUEZ JUSTINE, A GRANDSON OF FORMER COLONEL JUSTINE.
DEV-MUC3-1291	CARACAS , 18 MAY 90 -- GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO SAID TODAY IN CARACAS THAT HE "FIRMLY BELIEVES" THAT A SALVADORAN RIGHT-WING POLITICAL GROUP PARTICIPATED IN THE ASSASSINATION IN GUATEMALA OF SALVADORAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER HECTOR OQUELI AND HIS COMPANION GILDA FLORES IN LATE JANUARY. IN A NEWS CONFERENCE TODAY AT THE AYACUCHO ROOM OF THE MIRAFLORES PALACE, CEREZO SAID HE WILL DELIVER A DETAILED REPORT ON THIS CASE TO VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, TO SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL, AND TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT, TO WHICH HE REQUESTED ALL THE NECESSARY ASSISTANCE TO IDENTIFY AND DETAIN THE ASSASSINS. REFERRING TO THE TALKS BEING HELD WITH THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT TO RENEGOTIATE IN CONCEPT THE OIL DEBT THAT GUATEMALA HAS WITH VENEZUELA -- WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT -- CEREZO SAID PRESIDENT PEREZ HAD ACCEPTED THE PROPOSAL. HOWEVER, THE TERMS ARE STILL BEING DISCUSSED. THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT REQUESTED 20 YEARS TO PAY THE DEBT, A SIX-YEAR GRACE PERIOD, AND A FOUR-YEAR ON THE INTEREST. THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE PRESENTED TO THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT . THE PROPOSAL WILL THEN BE PRESENTED AT THE UPCOMING CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS SUMMIT. DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE WITH VENEZUELAN AND FOREIGN JOURNALISTS, THE GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT, WHO ARRIVED ON 17 MAY IN VENEZUELA, SAID THAT TO CONSOLIDATE PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO HAVE GRADUAL DEMILITARIZATION, WITH THE RESULTING REDUCTION IN WEAPONS AND LOCAL ARMIES, "WHICH SHOULD BE LEFT UNSUITED TO CARRY OUT EXTERNAL ATTACKS." CONCERNING NICARAGUA, CEREZO SAID THE PROFESSIONALIZATION AND IDEOLOGICAL INDEPENDENCE OF THE ARMY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO REAFFIRMING ITS DEMOCRACY.
DEV-MUC3-1292	GUATEMALA CITY, 19 MAY 90 -- THE BUS STRIKE IN GUATEMALA CITY CONTINUED FOR THE FOURTH DAY TODAY. LAST NIGHT, THERE WERE NEW DISTURBANCES AND TERRORIST BOMBS WERE SET OFF. ALTHOUGH THE SITUATION HAS CAUSED GREAT DISCONTENT AMONG THE 1.2 MILLION PEOPLE OF THE CAPITAL, THE GOVERNMENT HAS FOR THE TIME BEING REJECTED THE MUNICIPALITY'S REQUEST TO PLACE THE BUS SERVICES UNDER MILITARY CONTROL. THE BUS OWNERS ARE ASKING FOR A 100-PERCENT INCREASE IN THE 20 CENTAVO FARE, ARGUING THAT INFLATION HAS INCREASED THE PRICE OF GASOLINE AND THE BUS MAINTENANCE COSTS. HOWEVER, THE MUNICIPALITY HAS NOT AUTHORIZED THE INCREASE, FEARING A GENERALIZED PROTEST BY BUS PASSENGERS.
DEV-MUC3-1293	HAVANA , 18 MAY 90 -- NINE YEARS AGO TODAY, THEN ECUADORAN PRESIDENT JAIME ROLDOS AGUILERA DIED WHEN HIS PLANE CRASHED WHILE ON A FLIGHT TO THE INTERIOR OF HIS COUNTRY. THE SMALL PLANE SUFFERED THE ACCIDENT WHILE FLYING THE PRESIDENT, HIS WIFE, AND A DELEGATION THAT INCLUDED HIGH- RANKING ARMY OFFICERS FROM QUITO TO LOJA PROVINCE. ALL OF THEM DIED. THE RELATIVES OF THE LATE PRESIDENT EXPRESSED DOUBTS THAT THE PLANE CRASHED ACCIDENTALLY AND FILED CHARGES AS PRIVATE CITIZENS, BUT THE CASE WAS LATER CLOSED. DOUBTS HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT THE ALLEGED ACCIDENT, AND THE CASE RESURFACED AGAIN WHEN A NEW INVESTIGATION WAS OPENED AND ONE OF THE WITNESSES DISCLOSED THAT THERE IS EVIDENCE OF PARTICIPATION BY THE U.S. CIA IN THE DEATH OF ROLDOS AND HIS RETINUE. ERNESTO BUENANO, ROLDOS' POLITICAL ADVISER, ASSERTED BEFORE A MULTIPARTY COMMISSION OF THE ECUADORAN CONGRESS THAT THE PLANE ACCIDENT IN WHICH THE FORMER PRESIDENT DIED DID NOT RESULT FROM HUMAN ERROR OR TECHNICAL FAILURE BUT FROM SABOTAGE, WHICH CONSISTED OF CONTAMINATING THE PLANE'S FUEL TO CAUSE ITS ENGINES TO STALL. THE WITNESS POINTED OUT THAT THERE IS INCONTESTABLE EVIDENCE ABOUT THIS AND URGED THE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THE PERSONS WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR SUPPLYING FUEL TO THE PRESIDENT'S PLANE. IT IS WORTH MENTIONING THAT ROLDOS' ADMINISTRATION WAS CHARACTERIZED BY A PROGRESSIVE ORIENTATION, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY BY HIS DIRECT OPPOSITION TO U.S. ATTEMPTS TO DOMINATE THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES. THE FORMER PRESIDENT WAS OPENLY IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT OF NICARAGUA AND THE SALVADORAN INSURGENTS. HIS ADOPTION OF THIS STANCE LED U.S. IMPERIALISM TO CONSIDER THE ROLDOS DOCTRINE AS A DANGER TO ITS INTERESTS. WHEN ONE RECALLS THE POSITION OF THE FORMER ECUADORAN PRESIDENT, THE DISAPPEARANCE OF FORMER PANAMANIAN LEADER OMAR TORRIJOS HERRERA ALSO COMES TO MIND. TORRIJOS' DEATH WAS SIMILAR IN CIRCUMSTANCES TO THAT OF JAIME ROLDOS, AND HIS PATRIOTIC ATTITUDE WITH REGARD TO HIS COUNTRY'S SOVEREIGNTY WAS ALSO SIMILAR. TORRIJOS AND ROLDOS WERE A NUISANCE TO U.S. PLANS IN LATIN AMERICA AND BOTH WERE MURDERED, AS VARIOUS SOURCES HAVE DISCLOSED. FORMER CHILEAN PRESIDENT SALVADOR ALLENDE IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT THE CIA'S HAND DIRECTLY TOOK HIS LIFE, THE ORGANIZATION DID HELP DESTABILIZE HIS PROGRESSIVE GOVERNMENT. THE INVESTIGATIONS ON JAIME ROLDOS' DEATH AND WHAT WAS SAID AT THE TIME ABOUT THE ALLEGED ACCIDENT SUFFERED BY OMAR TORRIJOS REVEAL ONCE MORE THE SINISTER PLANS OF THE U.S. CIA AGAINST OUR LATIN AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN PEOPLE, WHO MUST REMAIN ON THE ALERT.
DEV-MUC3-1294	CARACAS , 19 MAY 90 -- GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO LEFT HERE TODAY FOR HIS COUNTRY AT 1400 , OFFICIAL SOURCES IN THE VENEZUELAN CAPITAL HAVE CONFIRMED. CEREZO, WHO WAS VISITING CARACAS OFFICIALLY SINCE 17 MAY, SIGNED TWO TECHNICAL AND SCIENTIFIC COOPERATION AGREEMENTS ON ENERGY MATTERS WITH HIS VENEZUELAN COUNTERPART CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ. THE GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT ALSO SECURED AN AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE TO REFINANCE THE GUATEMALAN OIL DEBT TO VENEZUELA IN THE AMOUNT OF $200 MILLION FOR A 20-YEAR TERM, WITH A 6-YEAR GRACE PERIOD, AT 4 PERCENT INTEREST. VENEZUELA SUPPLIES GUATEMALA WITH 7,000 BARRELS OF OIL PER DAY WITHIN THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT WHEREIN IT IS ENGAGED WITH MEXICO TO SELL OIL UNDER SPECIAL TERMS TO CENTRAL AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN NATIONS. CEREZO SAID THAT THE TOTAL DEBT OF THE COUNTRIES WHO BENEFIT FROM THE OIL SUPPLIED BY MEXICO AND VENEZUELA AMOUNTS TO $3 BILLION, FOR WHICH INTERNATIONAL REFINANCING IS SOUGHT. THIS TOPIC WILL BE BROACHED AT THE UPCOMING CENTRAL AMERICAN ECONOMIC SUMMIT TO BE HELD IN GUATEMALA. THE GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT WAS SEEN OFF AT THE MAIQUETIA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT BY PRESIDENT PEREZ.
DEV-MUC3-1295	NO CITY, NO DATE -- FOLLOWING IS A COMPILATION OF REPORTS ON DRUG SEIZURES AND ARRESTS RELATED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING IN BUREAU COVERAGE AREA FROM 11 MAY TO 18 MAY. COLOMBIA NATIONAL POLICE IN BOGOTA DISMANTLED THREE COCAINE PROCESSING LABORATORIES AND SEIZED ONE TON OF COCAINE, IT WAS REPORTED ON 17 MAY. HONDURAS HONDURAN POLICE IN TEGUCIGALPA SEIZED SIX TONS OF MARIJUANA AT A PLANTATION LOCATED IN OCOTEPEQUE DEPARTMENT IN THE COUNTRY'S WESTERN REGION. THE POLICE INTERROGATED SEVERAL PERSONS LINKED WITH THE DRUGS AND REPORTED THAT THE MARIJUANA HAD A MARKET VALUE OF $1 MILLION. POLICE LIEUTENANT JOSE DANIEL AMADOR ORDONEZ REPORTED THAT HONDURAN CARLOS MANUEL LOPEZ MATA WAS THE OWNER OF THE PLANTATION WHERE THE POLICE DISCOVERED MARIJUANA VALUED AT $8 MILLION LEMPIRAS. MATA ESCAPED TOGETHER WITH SALVADORANS LUIS AND GUILLERMO GUERRA WHO WERE ALSO CONNECTED WITH THE DRUGS FOUND. THE POLICE OFFICER SAID THE DRUGS WERE READY TO BE SHIPPED TO EL SALVADOR THROUGH THE BORDER REGION OF EL RINCON DE MARCHALA. HONDURAN POLICE HAVE SEIZED 58 KG OF COCAINE WHICH DRUG BANDS INTENDED TO SMUGGLE INTO THE UNITED STATES. THE POLICE DISCOVERED THE DRUGS INSIDE VEHICLES WITH CAMOUFLAGED COMPARTMENTS IN THE NORTHERN CITY OF SAN PEDRO SULA, 255 KM FROM TEGUCIGALPA. THE TRAFFICKERS PLANNED TO TAKE THE DRUG FROM PANAMA TO THE UNITED STATES. FIVE HONDURANS AND COLOMBIAN RODOLFO ANTONIO MONTOYA WERE ARRESTED IN THIS CONNECTION. IT WAS ALSO LEARNED IN TEGUCIGALPA ON 18 MAY THAT COLOMBIAN DRUG LEADER GUILLERMO LEON VELASQUEZ, WHO IS AT THE SERVICE OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, WAS ARRESTED ON 15 MAY AND DEPORTED TO THE UNITED STATES WHERE HE IS ACCUSED OF KILLING A PERSON SIX YEARS AGO. THE REPORT ADDED THAT LEON VELASQUEZ, KNOWN IN MEDELLIN AS "CHIRUZA," IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SEVEN OTHER MURDERS. MEXICO FEDERAL JUDICIAL POLICE AGENTS SEIZED 1,850 KG OF COCAINE WHEN A COLOMBIAN AIRCRAFT CRASHED IN THE TOWN OF ESCALON IN CIUDAD JUARES, CHIHUAHUA. THE DRUGS WERE BEING FLOWN TO THE UNITED STATES. PJF COMMANDER GUILLERMO GONZALEZ CALDERONI SAID THAT THE DRUGS WERE FOUND 30 KM NORTHEAST OF THE CITY OF JIMENEZ. THE DRUGS ARE REPORTED TO HAVE A MARKET VALUE OF 1 BILLION PESOS. FEDERAL HIGHWAY POLICE IN SALTILLO REPORTED THAT 781 KG OF PURE COCAINE, WHICH WAS BEING TRANSPORTED IN A TRAILER FROM GUATEMALA TO HOUSTON, TEXAS, WAS SEIZED TODAY. POLICE COMMANDER JORGE ESLAVA SAID THAT ANGEL GUADALUPE RIVERA RIVAS, DRIVER OF THE TRAILER, AND BALTAZAR FIGUEROA MATEO, HIS ASSISTANT, WERE ARRESTED. THE NATIONAL DEFENSE SECRETARIAT REPORTED ON 13 MAY THAT A TOTAL OF 632 KG OF MARIJUANA WERE SEIZED IN DIFFERENT OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT IN THE STATES OF JALISCO AND OAXACA FROM 8 TO 11 MAY. MOST OF THE PERSONS ARRESTED WERE TURNED OVER TO THE PERTINENT AUTHORITIES. THE REPORT ADDS THAT OVER THE SAME PERIOD A TOTAL OF 37 HECTARES WERE DESTROYED AND 122 FIREARMS WERE SEIZED. THE SAME SOURCE ADDED THAT MEMBERS OF THE 18TH INFANTRY BATTALION IN IXCOTEL, OAXACA, CLASHED WITH DRUG TRAFFICKERS ON 10 MAY, RESULTING IN THE DEATHS OF A SOLDIER AND A CIVILIAN. THE POLICE ARRESTED 11 PERSONS AND SEIZED 300 KG OF MARIJUANA, TWO VEHICLES, AND LARGE CALIBER WEAPONS. DURING OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT IN CIUDAD OBREGON, SALTILLO, AND MEXICALI, ANTIDRUG POLICEMEN SEIZED 1,382 KG OF COCAINE BASE AND ONE AND A HALF TONA OF MARIJUANA, AND ARRESTED 10 ALLEGED DRUG TRAFFICKERS, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS REPORTED. IN MEXICALI, ANTINARCOTICS POLICEMEN SEIZED MORE THAN ONE AND A HALF TONS OF MARIJUANA AND ARRESTED FIVE DRUG TRAFFICKERS. DURING THE ENSUING CLASH, MARCO ANTONIO RESENDIZ GASTELUM, THE LEADER OF THE BAND, WAS KILLED.
DEV-MUC3-1296	SAN SALVADOR, 21 MAY 90 -- A MILITARY SPOKESMAN HAS REPORTED THAT ONE CIVILIAN WAS KILLED AND FIVE OTHER PEOPLE, INCLUDING A POLICEMAN, WERE INJURED TODAY AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION OF A GRENADE THROWN AT A POLICE PATROL CAR BY ALLEGED URBAN GUERRILLA COMMANDOS. THE CIVILIAN WHO WAS KILLED HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS JOSE OVIDIO GOMEZ, A TAXI DRIVER, AND THE INJURED POLICEMAN IS RICARDO ANTONIO MARTINEZ. MARTINEZ AND THE OTHER PERSONS WHO WERE INJURED, SOME SERIOUSLY, WERE TAKEN TO A SAN SALVADOR MEDICAL CENTER. ACCORDING TO THE SOURCE, THE GRENADE WAS THROWN AT 0630 TODAY. THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE NEAR THE CENTRAL MARKETPLACE, SAN SALVADOR'S MOST IMPORTANT SUPPLY CENTER, WHICH IS VERY CROWDED AT THAT TIME OF DAY. THE SOURCE ATTRIBUTED THE ATTACK TO URBAN GUERRILLA COMMANDOS, BUT THE GUERRILLAS HAVE NOT CLAIMED CREDIT FOR IT. THIS IS THE FIRST ATTACK THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL SINCE THE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT BEGAN LAST WEDNESDAY IN VENEZUELA. THE TALKS ARE IN THEIR SIXTH DAY TODAY AND THERE IS AN ATMOSPHERE OF OPTIMISM. ACCORDING TO SOURCES CLOSE TO THE DIALOGUE, IMPORTANT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE TO SECURE THE PACIFICATION OF EL SALVADOR, WHICH FOR A DECADE HAS BEEN ENDURING A CIVIL WAR IN WHICH MORE THAN 70,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED.
DEV-MUC3-1297	SANTIAGO, 21 MAY 90 -- CHILEAN PRESIDENT PATRICIO AYLWIN WILL TODAY REPORT ON THE FIRST 70 DAYS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION AND WILL MAKE IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENTS CONCERNING HIS FUTURE PLANS IN A SPEECH TO A PLENARY MEETING OF THE CHILEAN CONGRESS THAT WILL MARK THE BEGINNING OF SPECIAL CONGRESSIONAL SESSIONS. AYLWIN'S SPEECH AWAKENS CONSIDERABLE EXPECTATION BECAUSE OF RECENT UNPUBLICIZED CLASHES BETWEEN AYLWIN'S ADMINISTRATION AND GENERAL AUGUST PINOCHET, WHO HAS BEEN THROWING HIS WEIGHT AROUND AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMY, AND ALSO BECAUSE OF THE GROWING RIGHTWING OPPOSITION TO THE ACTIONS OF THE DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION. POLITICAL ANALYSTS HAVE POINTED OUT THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL SPEECH WILL COINCIDE WITH THE "END OF A GOVERNMENT-OPPOSITION HONEYMOON" THAT HAD MARKED THE INITIAL WEEKS OF THE NEW ADMINISTRATION. THE ADMINISTRATION'S INITIATIVES REGARDING HUMAN RIGHTS, TAX REFORM, THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, AND OTHER STEPS AIMED AT DEPRIVING MILITARY COURTS OF THEIR POWERS HAVE WORSENED THE CONFLICT AND HAVE MADE THINGS MORE DIFFICULT FOR AYLWIN'S ADMINISTRATION. THIS IS HAPPENING BECAUSE, WHILE THE RIGHTWING PARTIES ARE LEANING MORE AND MORE TOWARD PINOCHET EVERY DAY AND LONGING FOR HIS AUTHORITARIAN REGIME, THE LEFTWING PARTIES AND EVEN SECTORS OF THE COALITION OF PARTIES FOR DEMOCRACY HAVE BEEN CRITICIZING AYLWIN FOR ALLEGED "LUKEWARM" APPROACH TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC CHANGES THAT HE PROMISED DURING HIS ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN. THE RIGHTWING HAS TAKEN DUE ADVANTAGE OF SEVERAL UNSOLVED TERRORIST ATTACKS OVER THE RECENT WEEKS TO PROP UP ITS OPPOSITION IN CONGRESS TO BILLS RELATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS. HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO RECENT OPINION POLLS, AYLWIN WILL MAKE HIS SPEECH AMID GROWING POPULARITY, MUCH HIGHER THAN THE SUPPORT HE OBTAINED AT THE 14 DECEMBER ELECTIONS. THE PRESIDENTIAL SPEECH TO CONGRESS AT THE LEGISLATIVE PALACE IN VALPARAISO, 125 KM WEST OF SANTIAGO, WILL MARK THE RETURN TO A LONG-STANDING DEMOCRATIC TRADITION THAT CHILEANS USED TO ENJOY EVERY 21 MAY. ON THIS DAY, THE REPORT TO CONGRESS WAS YET ANOTHER REASON FOR POPULAR REJOICING BECAUSE IT COINCIDED WITH THE "NAVAL GLORIES DAY" WHICH IS ALSO COMMEMORATED ON 21 MAY IN MEMORY OF THE CHILE'S TOP NAVAL HERO ARTURO PRAT WHO DIED IN THE NAVAL BATTLE OF IQUIQUE DURING THE 1879 PACIFIC WAR. SINCE CONGRESS WAS CLOSED DOWN DURING THE MILITARY REGIME, GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET USED TO READ HIS STATE OF THE NATION ADDRESS ON 11 SEPTEMBER, THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE MILITARY COUP D'ETAT THROUGH WHICH HE SEIZED POWER. ACCORDING TO POLITICAL ANALYSTS, AYLWIN'S SPEECH MAY PROVIDE THE KEY TO THE LAYOUT OF CHILE'S TRANSITION IN THE FUTURE. THE MANNER IN WHICH THE PRESIDENT WILL MAKE HIS REPORT IS RATHER CURIOUS BECAUSE THEORETICALLY THIS REPORT SHOULD ENCOMPASS ONE YEAR OF GOVERNMENT, WHILE AYLWIN HAS BEEN PRESIDENT FOR ONLY 70 DAYS DURING WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN HARSHLY CRITICIZED BY THE RIGHTWING EVERY TIME THE ADMINISTRATION HAD SOMETHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT THE PRIOR MILITARY REGIME. GENERAL PINOCHET PERSONALLY TOLD AYLWIN THAT HE FELT OFFENDED BY AYLWIN'S LABOR DAY CELEBRATION SPEECH ON 1 MAY. DURING HIS LATEST PRIVATE MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT, PINOCHET TOLD AYLWIN THAT HE FELT THAT THE "TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION" COMMISSION THAT AYLWIN HAD CREATED TO INVESTIGATE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS DURING THE MILITARY REGIME WAS A DIRECT ATTACK ON THE ARMY. PINOCHET ALSO TOLD AYLWIN THAT BY WAY OF "PROTEST" AGAINST THESE ACTIONS HE WOULD NOT ATTEND THE LUNCHEON TO WHICH THE PRESIDENT HAD INVITED ALL THE COMMANDERS OF THE ARMED FORCES BRANCHES. ACCORDING TO LEAKS ABOUT THIS MEETING, AYLWIN TOLD PINOCHET: "WATCH YOUR STEP, GENERAL" AND REMINDED HIM THAT OFFENSIVE BEHAVIOR AGAINST THE PRESIDENT COULD HARM PINOCHET'S IMAGE EVEN WITHIN HIS OWN INSTITUTION, THE ARMY. PINOCHET DID NOT ATTEND THE LUNCHEON, HOWEVER, SENDING INSTEAD GENERAL HUGO SALAS, THE THIRD HIGHEST-RANKING ARMY OFFICER AND THE FORMER CHIEF OF THE CNI , THE SECRET POLICE OF HIS REGIME. PINOCHET FAILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO CONVOKE THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL AND TO MAKE THIS COUNCIL ISSUE A STATEMENT AGAINST THE "TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION" COMMISSION, BUT PINOCHET'S SORTIE IN THE POLITICAL ARENA AWOKE CONCERN LACED WITH FEAR, AS ONE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL ADMITTED TO EFE. THE SOURCE, WHO ASKED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS, ADDED THAT "PINOCHET IS AWARE OF THE FEAR HE AWAKENS AND HE USES IT ADROITLY." THE FORMER PRESIDENT WILL NOT ATTEND THE TODAY'S CEREMONY IN CONGRESS ALTHOUGH THE COMMANDERS OF THE OTHER ARMED FORCES BRANCHES, THE VERY SAME ONES THAT DID NOT SUPPORT HIS ATTEMPT TO CONVOKE THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, WILL BE PRESENT. PINOCHET CLAIMED THAT HE HAS "INSTITUTIONAL REASONS" FOR HIS ABSENCE AND HAS LEFT FOR NORTHERN CHILE WHERE HE IS CURRENTLY TOURING ARMY GARRISONS. ANALYSTS BELIEVE THAT THE "PINOCHET EFFECT" WILL BE NOTICEABLE IN AYLWIN'S SPEECH THROUGH GREATER MODERATION IN ANNOUNCEMENTS OF NEW INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES AND THROUGH MORE BENIGN ASSESSMENTS OF THE PREVIOUS MILITARY REGIME.
DEV-MUC3-1298	SAN SALVADOR, 21 MAY 90 -- THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT INFORMS THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY: 1. SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE INITIATION OF THE CARACAS MEETING ON 16 MAY, THE ARMED FORCES LAUNCHED A GENERAL OFFENSIVE WITH AERIAL BOMBINGS, MASSIVE ARTILLERY ATTACKS, AND THE DEPLOYMENT OF PARATROOPERS AND INFANTRY SOLDIERS TO ALL OUR RURAL FRONTS. FOLLOWING FIVE DAYS OF INTENSE COMBAT, WE HAVE CONFIRMED THAT IT IS A ROUTINE OPERATION AND NOT A LARGE-SCALE OFFENSIVE. 2. OUR FORCES HAVE REJECTED THE ENEMY'S GENERAL OFFENSIVE AND TO DATE HAVE DOWNED ONE HELICOPTER, DAMAGED TWO OTHERS, AND INFLICTED DOZENS OF CASUALTIES ON THE ENEMY TROOPS. WE DENY THAT COMMANDER LEONCIO PICHINTE WAS KILLED IN COMBAT. 3. WHILE THE GOVERNMENT ACCUSES THE FMLN OF HAVING VIOLATED THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE TALKS, CRISTIANI AND THE PROCESS HAVE BEEN MAKING A SERIES OF STATEMENTS CONCERNING CONFIDENTIAL ISSUES. 4. FROM THE SIGNING OF THE GENEVA AGREEMENT, THE GOVERNMENT HAS INCREASED ITS INTERFERENCE OF OUR RADIO VENCEREMOS AND RADIO FARABUNDO MARTI, WHICH REFLECTS THE GOVERNMENT'S WEAKNESS. IT CANNOT STAND TO HAVE OUR POSITIONS KNOWN. THEREFORE, THERE IS CLEARLY NO FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, WHICH IN TURN DELAYS THE POSSIBILITY OF A CEASE-FIRE BECAUSE IT HINDERS THE NATIONAL DEBATE WE NEED IN ORDER TO REACH A POLITICAL SOLUTION. 5. FROM THE ABOVE SITUATION, WE CONCLUDE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS USED THE CARACAS MEETING AS PART OF A WAR PLAN, WITH CRISTIANI PARTICIPATING AT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE LEVEL WITH A VIEW TO POINTING OUT THE CONTRADICTORINESS OF THE FMLN'S POLITICAL ACTIVITY. WITH THE NEGOTIATION AND THE INTERFERENCE OF OUR RADIO STATIONS, THE FMLN HAS SILENCED THE CONFIDENTIALITY ARGUMENT, WHILE THE ARMY IS TRYING TO MILITARILY ANNIHILATE US AND IS OPENLY PROCLAIMING IT BY SAYING THAT IT HAS ATTACKED COMMAND POSTS AND KILLED FMLN LEADERS. 6. THE FMLN REITERATES THAT AS LONG AS A CEASE-FIRE IS NOT AGREED UPON THROUGH A POLITICAL AGREEMENT THAT WILL END THE ARMY'S IMPUNITY, AND SPECIFIC PLEDGES ARE NOT MADE TO DEMILITARIZE THE COUNTRY, IT RESERVES THE LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF EVEN BY LAUNCHING OFFENSIVES, REGARDLESS OF THEIR SCOPE, WHENEVER NECESSARY ANYWHERE WITHIN THE NATIONAL TERRITORY.
DEV-MUC3-1299	BOGOTA, 21 MAY 90 -- FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: I ADDRESS YOU AT A MOMENT WHEN ALL GOOD COLOMBIANS ARE FILLED WITH PAIN. TERRORIST ACTIONS HAVE BROUGHT SADNESS AND MOURNING TO DOZENS OF OUR POOR HOMES, AS WELL AS TO FAMILIES OF NATIONAL LEADERS. COLOMBIA'S ENEMIES HAVE DEDICATED THEMSELVES TO ATTACKING UNARMED CITIZENS. THEIR INSANE ACTIONS ARE ENDING THE LIVES OF INNOCENT CHILDREN, WOMEN, AND HONEST COLOMBIANS. AT THESE TRYING TIMES, I SEND ALL THOSE WHO HAVE SUFFERED THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS IRRATIONAL WAVE OF MONSTROUS CRIMES MY DEEPEST SENTIMENTS OF SOLIDARITY. I WANT TO TELL ALL THE VICTIMS' RELATIVES AND FRIENDS THAT WE SHARE THEIR SORROW AND SADNESS. THE COUNTRY AND ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN DEALT A STRONG BLOW TODAY. ANOTHER GREAT MAN HAS BEEN ASSASSINATED. LIBERAL LEADER FEDERICO ESTRADA VELEZ WAS VIOLENTLY MURDERED IN THE STREETS OF MEDELLIN. THE LOSS OF SENATOR ESTRADA VELEZ LEAVES THE LIBERAL PARTY AND ANTIOQUIANS WITHOUT ONE OF ITS GREAT LEADERS. HE IS TO BE ADDED TO THE LIST OF MARTYRS THAT HAVE BEEN MURDERED FOR THEIR THOUGHTS AND BRAVE ATTITUDE IN CONFRONTING THE COUNTRY'S PROBLEMS. FEDERICO ESTRADA WAS A FIGHTER IN THIS ADMINISTARTION AND, AS OUR COLOMBIAN AMBASSADOR TO ITALY, CONTRIBUTED TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF RELATIONS WITH THAT COUNTRY AND WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY. THE COUNTRY RECALLS HIM FOR HIS RECENT ACTIONS AS THE PROPONENT AND PROMOTER OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS PROJECT AT THE SENATE. HIS BRILLANT POLITICAL AND PROFESSIONAL CAREER ALLOWED HIM TO REACH THE HIGHEST POSITIONS OF THE COLOMBIAN CONGRESS AND OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. HE WAS A SUPREME COURT MAGISTRATE, UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR, PARLIAMENTARIAN, THE NATIONAL AND DEPARTMENTAL LEADER OF THE LIBERAL PARTY, A PUBLIC SERVANT OF MANY YEARS, AND A TIRELESS WORKER FOR THE WELLBEING OF THE PEOPLE OF ANTIOQUA. HIS LIFE WAS ENDED AT A TIME WHEN THE COUNTRY AND HIS PARTY NEEDED HIS EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE. TO HIS WIFE, HIS FOUR CHILDREN, HIS FOLLOWERS, AND ALL ANTIOQUEANS, I SEND A HEARTFELT MESSAGE OF CONDOLENCE IN THE NAME OF ALL HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN. THE PEOPLE ARE SICK OF THIS IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE. ALL COLOMBIANS GET ANGRY EACH TIME A BARBARIC ACT TAKES PLACE AND EACH TIME ONE OF OUR LEADERS IS MURDERED. LET US TURN THIS ANGER INTO A PUBLIC CONDEMNATION OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE ACTIONS, IN A DECIDED ACTION BY ALL AGAINST THE EMPIRE OF CRIME, AND IN EFFECTIVE SOLIDARITY WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. RECOVERING PEACE AND TRANQUILLITY IS A JOINT TASK. EVERY DAY WE MUST DEMAND MORE EFFICIENCY FROM OUR PUBLIC FORCES BUT WE MUST ALSO GIVE THEM MORE SOLIDARITY AND SUPPORT SO THAT THEY CAN EFFICIENTLY COMPLY WITH THEIR SERIOUS RESPONSIBILITIES. THIS IS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN DOING; IT HAS SUPPORTED THEM MORALLY AND MATERIALLY. TO DEFEAT TERRORISM AND IMPUNITY DEPENDS ABOVE ALL ON THE COOPERATION OF CITIZENS. WE MUST ALL BECOME LIKE SOLDIERS IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE BECAUSE THE FUTURE OF OUR FAMILIES, OUR PRINCIPLES, OUR RIGHTS, AND OUR DEMOCRACY ARE AT STAKE. LET THOSE WHO PROMOTE VIOLENCE FACE AN INVINCIBLE ARMY OF 30 MILLION HONEST COLOMBIANS. NO ONE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PAINFUL MOMENT THE COUNTRY IS ENDURING. THE INTERESTS OF COLOMBIA ARE ABOVE ALL OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. ON THE EVE OF THE ELECTIONS AND THE DECISION BY THE HONORABLE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY, AND AFTER A THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE MOST RECENT PUBLIC ORDER DISTURBANCES, I HAVE DEEMED IT APPROPRIATE TO SEND THE FOREIGN MINISTER TO REPRESENT COLOMBIA AT THE ANDEAN GROUP PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT. AS YOU ARE AWARE, THE ANDEAN GROUP PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT WILL BEGIN TOMORROW IN CUZCO, PERU. THIS MEETING WAS CALLED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF ACHIEVING NEW PROGRESS IN THE INTEGRATION OF THE SUBREGION, THROUGH NEW MECHANISMS FOR INTEGRATION AND WITH THE CREATION OF THE ANDEAN PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL. THE FOREIGN MINISTER WILL BE ENTRUSTED WITH REAFFIRMING COLOMBIA'S FULL COMMITMENT TO THE INTEGRATION PROCESS AND TO CONCERTED NEW JOINT ACTIONS WITH PERU, ECUADOR, BOLIVIA, AND VENEZUELA TO FACE THE PROBLEM OF THE CONSUMPTION, SMUGGLING, AND DRUG PRODUCTION. FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: I HEREBY REITERATE MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO ALL THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY VIOLENCE. IT IS AT THIS TIME OF SORROW AND SADNESS WHEN WE COLOMBIANS SHOULD BE MORE UNITED THAN EVER. I WANT TO INVITE YOU TO USE THE SUFFERING AND THE MEMORIES OF THOSE WHO HAVE FALLEN AS A FORCE THAT WILL GIVE US MORE COURAGE AND DETERMINATION TO CONTINUE TO PROGRESS IN BUILDING COLOMBIA IN PEACE, FREE OF TERRORISM AND VIOLENCE. GOOD NIGHT.
DEV-MUC3-1300	QUITO, 21 MAY 90 -- ALL MEDIA IN GUAYAQUIL AND MANY CORRESPONDENTS WHO HAVE COME TO THE PORT OF GUAYAQUIL TO COVER THE FOURTH ALFARO LIVES DAMMIT NATIONAL CONFERENCE ARE STILL UNAWARE OF WHERE THE MEETING IS BEING HELD. THE SURRENDERING OF WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF THIS GROUP WILL BE DISCUSSED AT THIS MEETING. THE FOUR-DAY MEETING BEGAN ON 18 MAY AT THE GUAYAS ELECTORAL TRIBUNAL. HOWEVER, THE MEETING WAS CONTINUED LATER AT AN UNDISCLOSED LOCATION IN GUAYAQUIL. DURING THEIR SESSIONS, IN ADDITION TO MAKING A DECISION ON THE SURRENDERING OF WEAPONS, AVC LEADERS WILL ALSO ASSESS THE AGREEMENT THEY SIGNED A YEAR AGO WITH THE PRESIDENT RODRIGO BORJA GOVERNMENT. THE ACCORD MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO CEASE THE ARMED STRUGGLE IN EXCHANGE FOR A GOVERNMENT DIALOGUE WITH SOCIAL SECTORS IN THE COUNTRY. PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE FOURTH AVC NATIONAL CONFERENCE, AVC LEADER SANTIAGO DILLMAN REPORTED ON 18 MAY THAT THE FINAL DECISION ON THE SURRENDERING OF WEAPONS WAS A LOGICAL STEP -- AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THE ARMED STRUGGLE IN ECUADOR AND IN THE REST OF LATIN AMERICA IS NO LONGER THE PROPER COURSE. THEREFORE, HE ANNOUNCED, THIS ALFARIST MEETING WILL ALSO ANALYZE THE DECISION TO ORGANIZE A NEW POLITICAL PARTY OR TO ALLOW AVC LEADERS TO JOIN AN ALREADY EXISTING GROUP RECOGNIZED BY THE SUPREME ELECTORAL TRIBUNAL. THESE ARE SOME OF THE POINTS ON THE AGENDA OF THE AVC MEETING, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO CONCLUDE ON 21 OR 22 MAY WITH A HISTORICAL RESOLUTION. HOWEVER, AVC LEADERS -- AMONG THEM SANTIAGO DILLMAN, MARCO TROYA, PEDRO MONCADA, AND JANETH SOSA -- HAVE PREFERRED NOT TO DISCLOSE THE SITE OF THE MEETING, WHICH HAS FRUSTRATED THE WORK OF JOURNALISTS. THE AVC LEADERS PLAN TO DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF DELIVERING WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF AVC MEMBERS TO A SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL DELEGATION IN A CEREMONY SIMILAR TO ONE RECENTLY HELD BY THE 19-APRIL MOVEMENT IN COLOMBIA, WHICH IN THE PAST HAS STAGED SEVERAL WELL-KNOWN MILITARY ACTIONS, INCLUDING THE KIDNAPPING OF BUSINESSMAN NAIM ISAIAS WITH THE HELP OF THE AVC. THE AVC HAS SAID IT WANTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COUNTRY'S INSTITUTIONAL LIFE. IN ORDER TO DO THIS, IT WILL PLEDGE TO SURRENDER ITS WEAPONS -- THE SYMBOL OF ITS REBELLION -- WHICH IT WILL CONTINUE WITH OR WITHOUT WEAPONS, AVC LEADERS HAVE SAID. THE AVC LEADERS CONTINUE MEETING AT AN UNKNOWN LOCATION IN GUAYAQUIL AND EXPECT TO REACH AN AGREEMENT SOON ON LAYING DOWN THEIR WEAPONS, WHICH WOULD THEN BE DESTROYED IMMEDIATELY.
TST1-MUC3-0001	GUATEMALA CITY, 4 FEB 90 -- THE GUATEMALA ARMY DENIED TODAY THAT GUERRILLAS ATTACKED THE "SANTO TOMAS" PRESIDENTIAL FARM, LOCATED ON THE PACIFIC SIDE, WHERE PRESIDENT CEREZO HAS BEEN STAYING SINCE 2 FEBRUARY. A REPORT PUBLISHED BY THE "CERIGUA" NEWS AGENCY -- MOUTHPIECE OF THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY -- WHOSE MAIN OFFICES ARE IN MEXICO, SAYS THAT A GUERRILLA COLUMN ATTACKED THE FARM 2 DAYS AGO. HOWEVER, ARMED FORCES SPOKESMAN COLONEL LUIS ARTURO ISAACS SAID THAT THE ATTACK, WHICH RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF A CIVILIAN WHO WAS PASSING BY AT THE TIME OF THE SKIRMISH, WAS NOT AGAINST THE FARM, AND THAT PRESIDENT CEREZO IS SAFE AND SOUND. HE ADDED THAT ON 3 FEBRUARY PRESIDENT CEREZO MET WITH THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS ACCREDITED IN GUATEMALA. THE GOVERNMENT ALSO ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE DESCRIBING THE REBEL REPORT AS "FALSE AND INCORRECT," AND STRESSING THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS NEVER IN DANGER. COL ISAACS SAID THAT THE GUERRILLAS ATTACKED THE "LA EMINENCIA" FARM LOCATED NEAR THE "SANTO TOMAS" FARM, WHERE THEY BURNED THE FACILITIES AND STOLE FOOD. A MILITARY PATROL CLASHED WITH A REBEL COLUMN AND INFLICTED THREE CASUALTIES, WHICH WERE TAKEN AWAY BY THE GUERRILLAS WHO FLED TO THE MOUNTAINS, ISAACS NOTED. HE ALSO REPORTED THAT GUERRILLAS KILLED A PEASANT IN THE CITY OF FLORES, IN THE NORTHERN EL PETEN DEPARTMENT, AND BURNED A TANK TRUCK.
TST1-MUC3-0002	SAN SALVADOR, 18 FEB 90 -- HEAVY FIGHTING WITH AIR SUPPORT RAGED LAST NIGHT IN NORTHWESTERN SAN SALVADOR WHEN MEMBERS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT ATTACKED AN ELECTRIC POWER SUBSTATION. ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY REPORTS, A SOLDIER GUARDING THE SUBSTATION WAS WOUNDED. THE FIRST EXPLOSIONS BEGAN AT 2330 AND CONTINUED UNTIL EARLY THIS MORNING, WHEN GOVERNMENT TROOPS REQUESTED AIR SUPPORT AND THE GUERRILLAS WITHDREW TO THE SLOPES OF THE SAN SALVADOR VOLCANO, WHERE THEY ARE NOW BEING PURSUED. THE NOISE FROM THE ARTILLERY FIRE AND HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS WAS HEARD THROUGHOUT THE CAPITAL AND ITS OUTSKIRTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE CROWDED NEIGHBORHOODS OF NORTHERN AND NORTHWESTERN SAN SALVADOR, SUCH AS MIRALVALLE, SATELITE, MONTEBELLO, AND SAN RAMON. SOME EXPLOSIONS COULD STILL BE HEARD THIS MORNING. MEANWHILE, IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE CITIES OF SAN MIGUEL AND USULUTAN, THE LARGEST CITIES IN EASTERN EL SALVADOR, HAVE NO ELECTRICITY BECAUSE OF GUERRILLA SABOTAGE ACTIVITY.
TST1-MUC3-0003	SAN SALVADOR, 4 APR 89 -- EL SALVADOR'S SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE HAS RELIEVED JUDGE HECTOR LARIOS OF HIS DUTIES AS JUDGE AND NOTARY BECAUSE HE ORDERED THE RELEASE OF A BAND OF ALLEGED KIDNAPPERS. THE NEW JUDGE, RICARDO MEJIA, OVERTURNED THE RULING TO RELEASE THE EIGHT PEOPLE ACCUSED OF KIDAPPING AT LEAST SIX WEALTHY SALVADORANS IN THE EARLY 1980'S. SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE FRANCISCO JOSE GUERRERO ANNOUNCED LARIOS' DISMISSAL AND SUSPENDED HIS LICENSE TO PRACTICE LAW. "BASED ON A REVIEW OF LARIOS' IRREGULAR RULING, ONE CAN CONCLUDE THAT HIS BEHAVIOR IS UNBECOMING AN OFFICIAL WORTHY OF THE SUPREME COURT'S TRUST. WE ARE DISMAYED BY THAT JUDGE'S CONDUCT," HE NOTED. MOREOVER, MEJIA OVERTURNED THE RULING ORDERING THE RELEASE OF ORLANDO LLOVERA BALLET, LIEUTENANT ISIDRO LOPEZ, MAJOR ALFREDO JIMENEZ, AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE KIDNAPPING RING. LARIOS DECIDED ON FRIDAY TO RELEASE THE MEMBERS OF THE KIDNAPPING RING, WHICH INCLUDED SOME ARMY OFFICERS AND SYMPATHIZERS OF THE RIGHTIST NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE , WHICH WON THE 19 MARCH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. "THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE SUPREME COURT HAS LEVIED THIS KIND OF SANCTION IN A CASE SETTING A PRECEDENT IN JUDICIAL CORRUPTION," A COURT OFFICIAL ASSERTED, REFERRING TO LARIOS' DISMISSAL. LARIOS IS ALSO ACCUSED OF RELEASING MEMBERS OF A DRUG TRAFFICKING RING SOME YEARS AGO. BECAUSE THE RULING ON THE KIDNAPPERS WAS OVERTURNED, "THE CASE GOES BACK TO THE LOWER COURTS," THE NEW JUDGE SAID. THE KIDNAPPERS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE BEEN UNDER ARREST SINCE APRIL 1986, WERE ACCUSED OF KIDNAPPING SEVERAL BUSINESSMEN FOR HIGH SUMS OF MONEY. LARIOS'S RULING IN FAVOR OF THE KIDNAPPERS PROMPTED A BITTER REACTION FROM GOVERNMENT, POLITICAL, AND PROFESSIONAL SECTORS. THE NATIONAL AD COUNCIL, REPRESENTING NEWS MEDIA ANNOUNCERS, HAS URGED THAT THE KIDNAPPERS BE PROSECUTED TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THE LAW "SO THAT THOSE WHO PROFIT FROM THE SUFFERING OF OTHERS ARE PUNISHED."
TST1-MUC3-0004	BOGOTA, 30 AUG 89 -- LAST NIGHT'S TERRORIST TARGET WAS THE ANTIOQUIA LIQUEUR PLANT. FOUR POWERFUL ROCKETS WERE GOING TO EXPLODE VERY CLOSE TO THE TANKS WHERE 300,000 GALLONS OF THE SO-CALLED CASTILLE CRUDE, USED TO OPERATE THE BOILERS, IS STORED. THE WATCHMEN ON DUTY REPORTED THAT AT 2030 THEY SAW A MAN AND A WOMAN LEAVING A SMALL SUITCASE NEAR THE FENCE THAT SURROUNDS THE PLANT. THE WATCHMEN EXCHANGED FIRE WITH THE TERRORISTS WHO FLED LEAVING BEHIND THE EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL THAT ALSO INCLUDED DYNAMITE AND GRENADE ROCKET LAUNCHERS. METROPOLITAN POLICE PERSONNEL SPECIALIZING IN EXPLOSIVES, DEFUSED THE ROCKETS. SOME 100 PEOPLE WERE WORKING INSIDE THE PLANT. THE DAMAGE THE ROCKETS WOULD HAVE CAUSED HAD THEY BEEN ACTIVATED CANNOT BE ESTIMATED BECAUSE THE CARIBE SODA FACTORY AND THE GUAYABAL RESIDENTIAL AREA WOULD HAVE ALSO BEEN AFFECTED. THE ANTIOQUIA LIQUEUR PLANT HAS RECEIVED THREATS IN THE PAST AND MAXIMUM SECURITY HAS ALWAYS BEEN PRACTICED IN THE AREA. SECURITY WAS STEPPED UP LAST NIGHT AFTER THE INCIDENT. THE LIQUEUR INDUSTRY IS THE LARGEST FOREIGN EXCHANGE PRODUCER FOR THE DEPARTMENT.
TST1-MUC3-0005	MANAGUA , 11 DEC 89 -- HOW ABOUT THE SANDINIST SOLDIERS THAT ALLEGEDLY . NO SANDINIST SOLDIERS ARE BEING HELD BY THE CREW OF THAT BOAT? THAT IS WHAT I SAID. FURTHERMORE, ONE OF THE BOATS WITH 50 CREW MEMBERS HAS SHOWN UP IN HONDURAS AND IT IS WHAT IS CAUSING THIS PROBLEM. THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS WITH SOME COLOMBIANS CONCERNING CONTRABAND, RIGHT? WE ARE THERE TO PROTECT THE FISHING RESOURCES AND TO PREVENT ANY TYPE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING, GUN RUNNING OR ANY MERCHANDISE CONTRABAND. HOW DID THE MUTINY OCCUR? FROM THE TIME THEY WERE CAPTURED AND ON THE WAY TO CORN ISLAND, ONE OF THE OFFICERS ON BOARD WAS CARELESS. THEN, THE COOK AND THE CAPTAIN DISARMED ONE OF THE SOLDIERS, TOOK AWAY HIS RIFLE, AND THEY KILLED HIM. THE CREW THEN AVAILED ITSELF OF THIS INCIDENT TO RISE UP IN MUTINY. THE CAPTAIN WAS STRANGLING ONE OF THE OFFICERS WHEN ANOTHER OFFICER PULLED UP GUN ON HIM. HE IS THE CAPTAIN WHO RAN THE SHIP AGROUND IN A CORAL REEF. THE SHIPOWNERS WILL HAVE TO PAY A FINE AND AFTER THE FINE IS PAID, THEY MUST COMPLY WITH ALL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS SO THAT THE BOAT AND CREW ARE RETURNED TO THEM.
TST1-MUC3-0006	BOGOTA, 18 AUG 89 -- THE EXTRADITABLES TODAY CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MURDER OF ANTIOQUIA POLICE COMMANDER COLONEL WALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO, WHICH OCCURRED THIS MORNING IN MEDELLIN. THE CRIMINAL ATTACK ON THE OFFICER OCCURED A SCANT 1 MONTH AFTER THE MURDER OF ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT GOVERNOR ANTONIO ROLDAN BETANCUR. A POLICEMAN WAS KILLED AND ANOTHER POLICEMAN WOUNDED DURING THE TERRORIST ATTACK. COL QUINTERO DID NOT HAVE A POLICE ESCORT BY HIS OWN BEHEST. COL QUINTERO WAS DIRECTING OPERATIONS AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING AND CONSEQUENTLY HAD BEEN THE OBJECT OF DEATH THREATS. HERE IS A REPORT BY GLADYS VARGAS FROM MEDELLIN. THIS MORNING ANTIOQUIA POLICE COMMANDER COL WALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO LEFT HIS RESIDENCE TO BEGIN HIS DAILY TASKS AT ANTIOQUIA POLICE HEADQUARTERS. AS THE VEHICLE DROVE THROUGH THE AMERICA NEIGHBORHOOD, SEVEN BLOCKS FROM WHERE ANTIOQUIA GOVERNOR ANTONIO ROLDAN WAS KILLED, THE VEHICLE THAT COL QUINTERO WAS IN -- A WHITE NISSAN PATROL VEHICLE WITH LICENSE PLATES ME-7847 -- DREW TO A STOP IN FRONT OF A RED LIGHT AT THE CARRERA 80 CROSSING. SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS IN A GRAY MAZDA 626 VEHICLE, WITH LICENSE PLATES MI-1630, TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS CIRCUMSTANCE TO FIRE VOLLEYS OF SUBMACHINEGUN FIRE AGAINST COL QUINTERO, WHO DIED INSTANTLY. COL QUINTERO DID NOT HAVE A POLICE ESCORT. JUST 8 DAYS AGO HE DECIDED TO DISMISS THE ESCORT, BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT ANYONE ELSE TO BE KILLED IF THERE WERE AN ATTACK ON HIM. ONLY COL QUINTERO AND A POLICE DRIVER WERE IN THE VEHICLE. THE JUDGE OF THE 76TH DISTRICT COURT, WHO DIRECTED THE REMOVAL OF THE BODY, SAID THAT SEVERAL TYPES OF WEAPONS WERE USED IN THE ATTACK AND MORE THAN 100 SHOTS WERE FIRED.
TST1-MUC3-0007	GUATEMALA CITY, 31 AUG 89 -- THE LEADERSHIP OF THE COORDINATING COMMITTEE OF FARMING, COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL, AND FINANCIAL ASSOCIATIONS, CACIF, HAS MET WITH THE ACTING PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC. SOURCES CLOSE TO THE GOVERNMENT HAVE DISCLOSED THAT THEY DISCUSSED THE ECONOMIC PROGRAM PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT ON 25 AUGUST. ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCES, THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COUNTRY'S PRODUCTIVE SECTOR AND ACTING PRESIDENT ROBERTO CARPIO NICOLLE ALSO DISCUSSED THE VIOLENCE PREVAILING IN THE COUNTRY AND THE WAY LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES ARE COPING WITH THE PROBLEM THAT HAS ALREADY TAKEN A TOLL ON SEVERAL VICTIMS. NO DETAILS WERE DISCLOSED AS TO THE MEANS THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL ADOPT IN ORDER TO HALT THE WAVE OF TERROR THAT HAS TAKEN OVER THE COUNTRY, THE SAME SOURCES DISCLOSED, CLAIMING THAT THE MECHANISMS WILL BE ANNOUNCED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SECURITY PLAN THAT THE ACTING PRESIDENT WILL MAKE PUBLIC IN A FEW DAYS. A STATE OF SIEGE MIGHT BE IMPOSED AT ANY MOMENT, AS THIS IS ONE OF THE ALTERNATIVES THE GOVERNMENT HAS LEFT FOR CONTROLLING VIOLENCE, PARTICULARLY THE TERRORIST ACTIONS, SAID GOVERNMENT MINISTER ROBERTO VALLE BALDIZAN. THE MINISTER ADDED THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO WAIT FOR PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO TO RETURN TO THE COUNTRY.
TST1-MUC3-0008	BOGOTA, 14 SEP 89 -- DIEGO BIAFARA, ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY AND DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY INFORMANT, WHO APPEARED BEFORE A U.S. SENATE COMMITTEE ON 13 SEPTEMBER, REVEALED UNKNOWN LINKS BETWEEN THE ISRAELI AND BRITISH MERCENARIES, WHO HAVE TRAINED PARAMILITARY GROUPS IN OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS YAIR KLEIN IN FRONT. HE IS THE COLONEL WEARING THE DARK BLUE SHIRT. THE THIN PERSON BEHIND HIM WEARING THE LIGHT BLUE SHIRT IS TEDDY, WHO WAS THE TRANSLATOR. THERE WERE FIVE ISRAELI INSTRUCTORS. I REMEMBER THE NAMES: SADAKA, AMANCIA, YAIR, AND TEDDY. I CANNOT REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE FIFTH ONE. THERE WERE 11 BRITISH INSTRUCTORS. WE USED TO CALL THAT ONE DAVID. THIS MAN WAS AN EXPERT IN EXPLOSIVES. HE INSTRUCTED US ON HOW TO USE EXPLOSIVES. THESE WERE STATEMENTS MADE BY BIAFARA TO THE U.S. SENATE IN WHICH WE LEARNED OF A CLEAR LINK BETWEEN THE ISRAELI MERCENARIES, WHO WERE TRAINING PARAMILITARY GROUPS IN THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA REGION, AND THE BRITISH MERCENARIES WHO CAME TO THE COUNTRY ALLEGEDLY TO ASSASSINATE PABLO ESCOBAR. BIAFARA KNEW BOTH GROUPS OF MERCENARIES. ACCORDING TO HIS STATEMENTS GIVEN TO DAS LAST MARCH, NOT ONLY DID ISRAELI MERCENARIES TRAIN ASSASSINS IN MIDDLE MAGDALENA, THERE WAS ALSO A GROUP OF 11 BRITISH MERCENARIES, WHO GAVE LESSONS TO 50 STUDENTS. AMONG THE INSTRUCTORS THERE WAS PETER MCLISE, THE NAME OF ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE OPERATION AGAINST PABLO ESCOBAR, AND DAVID, WHO BIAFARA CLEARLY IDENTIFIED. HE WAS DAVID TOMKINS, THE MAN IN CHARGE OF THE PLOT AGAINST ESCOBAR. ACCORDING TO BIAFARA, MOST BRITISH INSTRUCTORS HAD TATOOS ON THEIR BREASTS, ARMS, AND SHOULDERS, JUST AS WE CAN SEE ON THE VIDEO TAPED BY THE BRITISH MEN WHO PREPARED THE OPERATION AGAINST ESCOBAR. IN CONCLUSION, THE MERCENARIES WHO WERE PREPARING TO ASSASSINATE ONE OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL LEADERS WERE THE SAME ONES WHO TRAINED THE ASSASSINS PAID BY THE CARTEL ITSELF.
TST1-MUC3-0009	SAN SALVADOR, 12 NOV 89 -- THE ARMED FORCES OF EL SALVADOR HEREBY REPORTS TO THE CITIZENS IN GENERAL THAT THE FMLN TERRORISTS HAVE BEEN REPELLED BY OUR COURAGEOUS SOLDIERS AND THAT THERE ARE NOW ONLY A FEW DISPERSED GROUPS OF CRIMINALS WHO ARE LOOTING. THE ARMED FORCES REPORT THAT IN DUE TIME THEY WILL ANNOUNCE STATISTICS ON THE CASUALTIES INFLICTED BY THE TERRORISTS AMONG THE CIVILIAN POPULATION, AS WELL AS THE MEMBERS OF THE ARMY WHO HAVE FALLEN IN THE LINE OF THEIR SACRED AND CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY. IN DUE TIME, THE ARMED FORCES WILL ANNOUNCE THE NUMBER OF TERRORISTS KILLED IN THEIR EFFORTS TO BRING SORROW AND MOURNING TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. THE ARMED FORCES ALSO REQUEST THAT THE PEOPLE FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS AT THE MILITARY CHECKPOINTS THROUGH WHICH THEY MUST PASS IN ORDER TO PREVENT ANY UNNECESSARY INCIDENTS. THE ARMED FORCES ALSO CALL ON THE PEOPLE TO REMAIN CALM. IN THE LOYAL FULFILLMENT OF THEIR DUTIES, THE ARMED FORCES OF THE REPUBLIC ARE DETERMINED TO CARRY OUT THIS STRUGGLE SO THAT DEMOCRACY WILL NOT BE HINDERED BY THESE CRIMINAL TERRORISTS, WHO IN RECENT HOURS HAVE BROUGHT MORE SORROW, MOURNING, AND GRIEF TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.
TST1-MUC3-0010	SAN SALVADOR, 19 MAR 89 -- ESTEEMED MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION: TODAY, 9 MARCH, WE HAVE RECEIVED A MESSAGE SIGNED BY THE MEMBERS OF YOUR COMMISSION ASKING US TO BEGIN THE PEACE TALKS. WE HAVE ALREADY ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS, EXPRESSING OUR WILLINGNESS TO HOLD A MEETING. THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION'S LETTER MAKES NO MENTION OF ANY MOVE TO POSTPONE THE ELECTIONS. IT DOES NOT EVEN CONSIDER INCLUDING THIS TOPIC ON THE MEETING'S AGENDA. ON THE CONTRARY, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE COMMISSION HAS ALREADY DECIDED TO HOLD THE ELECTIONS ON 19 MARCH. CONSEQUENTLY, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT HEREBY INFORMS THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION AND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE OF THE FOLLOWING: 1. THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION MUST CLEARLY AND PUBLICLY ANNOUNCE THAT IT IS WILLING TO REACH AN AGREEMENT ON CONFINING THE ARMY TO ITS BARRACKS ON THE DAY OF THE ELECTIONS, ESTABLISHING AN ELECTORAL CODE BY CONSENSUS, PROVIDING ABSENTEE VOTING FOR SALVADORANS LIVING ABROAD, RESTRUCTURING THE CENTRAL ELECTIONS COUNCIL, AND FORMING A COUNCIL FOR VERIFICATION. MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT MUST EXPRESS THE STATE POWERS' WILLINGNESS TO POSTPONE THE ELECTIONS FOR 5 MONTHS, ONCE A CEASE-FIRE HAS BEEN AGREED UPON. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION MUST PUBLICLY ANNOUNCE THAT IT IS WILLING TO BRING MILITARY COMMANDERS AND OFFICERS RESPONSIBLE FOR POLITICAL MURDERS AND CRIMES TO TRIAL, TO REDUCE THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES TO THE NUMBER OF TROOPS IT HAD IN 1968, AND TO DISBAND THE SECURITY FORCES TO FORM A NEW CIVIL POLICE. WE REITERATE OUR WILLINGNESS TO DISCUSS PERMANENTLY CEASING THE ARMED STRUGGLE. 2. IF THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION AGREES TO THE ABOVE REQUESTS, THE FMLN WILL AGREE TO A MEETING AND IS WILLING TO IMMEDIATELY DECIDE ON A DATE AND A TIME FOR THE MEETING. THE FMLN IS EVEN WILLING TO HOLD THE MEETING OUTSIDE EL SALVADOR. AS A PART OF THIS MEETING, WE ARE WILLING TO NEGOTIATE AND COME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE ARMED FORCES STAFF ON A CEASE-FIRE THAT WILL BRING ABOUT A PERMANENT AND NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT. 3. IF NO SUCH AGREEMENT IS REACHED, THEN THERE IS NO POINT IN HOLDING THE MEETING PRIOR TO 19 MARCH, BECAUSE IT WILL SIMPLY BE USED BY BOTH THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE IN THEIR ELECTION DISPUTE. THE ELECTIONS PLAY NO ROLE IN ACHIEVING PEACE; THEY ONLY SERVE TO PROVIDE A FALSE JUSTIFICATION FOR CONTINUING THE WAR. 4. WE AWAIT A RESPONSE FROM THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION.

TST1-MUC3-0011	SANTIAGO, 18 MAY 90 -- EDMUNDO VARGAS CARRENO, CHILEAN FOREIGN MINISTRY UNDER SECRETARY, HAS STATED THAT THE BRYANT TREATY WITH THE UNITED STATES WILL BE APPLIED IN THE LETELIER CASE ONLY TO COMPENSATE THE RELATIVES OF THE FORMER CHILEAN FOREIGN MINISTER MURDERED IN WASHINGTON AND THE RELATIVES OF HIS U.S. SECRETARY, RONNIE MOFFIT. THE CHILEAN FOREIGN UNDER SECRETARY MADE THIS STATEMENT IN REPLY TO U.S. NEWSPAPER REPORTS STATING THAT THE TREATY WOULD BE PARTIALLY RESPECTED. FOLLOWING ARE VARGAS CARRENO'S STATEMENTS AT A NEWS CONFERENCE HE HELD IN BUENOS AIRES BEFORE CONCLUDING HIS OFFICIAL VISIT TO ARGENTINA: THIS TREATY USED BY THE UNITED STATES IN 1989, DURING THE PAST ADMINISTRATION, TO SOLVE TWO PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE LETELIER CASE: THE PROBLEM OF COMPENSATION AND THE PROBLEM OF THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEATH OF ORLANDO LETELIER AND HIS ASSISTANT. IT HAS BEEN AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO USE THE TREATY EXCLUSIVELY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF COMPENSATION; THAT IS THE OBJECTIVE WHEN WE REFER TO ITS PARTIAL USE. SO AS FOR THE COMPENSATION SUBJECT, IT WILL BE USED. WE ARE USING THE MECHANISM CREATED BY THE FIVE-MEMBER COMMISSION ESTABLISHED BY THE TREATY. THE LANGUAGE OF THIS TREATY WAS PERTINENT FOR THE EARLY DECADES OF THIS CENTURY BUT IS NO LONGER IN KEEPING WITH CURRENT INTERNATIONAL PRACTICES. DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE WITH ARGENTINE AND FOREIGN JOURNALISTS, VARGAS CARRENO ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM WILL VISIT CHILE IN AUGUST IN RESPONSE TO AN INVITATION FROM CHILEAN PRESIDENT PATRICIO AYLWIN, WHO WILL ALSO VISIT ARGENTINA AT AN AS YET UNDETERMINED DATE. VARGAS CARRENO NOTED HIS SATISFACTION WITH HIS MEETINGS IN BUENOS AIRES WITH FOREIGN MINISTER DOMINGO CAVALLO AND RAUL CARIGNANO, UNDER SECRETARY FOR LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS. VARGAS CARRENO SAID THAT AS A RESULT OF THIS INITIAL CONTACT THE BINATIONAL COMMISSION ESTABLISHED BY THE CHILEAN-ARGENTINE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY, WHICH WAS SIGNED IN 1984, WILL MEET NEXT JULY. HE SAID THAT THE TWO COUNTRIES WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD FORMAL AND INFORMAL TALKS TO DISCUSS PROBLEMS OF COMMON INTEREST, SPEED UP THE INTEGRATION PROCESS, AND INCREASE MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AND COOPERATION. REGARDING THE SITUATION OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILEAN CITIZENS LIVING IN ARGENTINA -- A TOTAL HE ESTIMATED AT 800,000 -- VARGAS CARRENO SAID THAT PRESIDENT AYLWIN'S GOVERNMENT HAS ESTABLISHED AN OFFICE TO HELP THOSE CITIZENS LIVING ABROAD FOR VARIOUS REASONS TO RETURN TO CHILE, ESPECIALLY THOSE LIVING IN ARGENTINA'S PATAGONIA REGION WHO ARE BEING TREATED INHUMANELY, ESPECIALLY BY BUSINESSMEN IN THE BORDER AREA, AS REPORTED BY AN ARGENTINE JOURNALIST.
TST1-MUC3-0012	SAN SALVADOR, 21 NOV 89 -- LEFTIST GUERRILLAS EARLY TUESDAY ATTACKED A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR WHERE MANY GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY LEADERS HAVE THEIR HOMES. THE DIN OF GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSIONS COULD BE HEARD BEFORE DAWN IN THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD NEAR THE SHERATON HOTEL. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE FARABUNDO MARTI LAUNCHED THEIR OFFENSIVE 11 DAYS GO THAT FIGHTING HAD SPREAD TO THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH IS AT THE FOOT OF THE SAN SALVADOR VOLCANO. AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS FLEW OVER THE AREA AND THE SOUND OF MACHINEGUN FIRE COULD BE HEARD.
TST1-MUC3-0013	LIMA, 20 DEC 89 -- THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS CALLED A SPECIAL SESSION OF CONGRESS FOR TOMORROW AND THE NEXT DAY TO CONSIDER THE SERIOUS SITUATION OF PANAMA AND TO DENOUNCE THE INTER-AMERICAN RECIPROCAL ASSISTANCE TREATY, TIAR, FOR ITS INEFFECTIVENESS. THIS WAS ANNOUNCED BY PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA AT THE CONCLUSION OF A COUNCIL OF MINISTERS MEETING AT GOVERNMENT HOUSE TODAY. THE PRESIDENT ALSO EXPRESSED HIS SURPRISE OVER THE MILDNESS WITH WHICH THE REST OF THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES HAVE REACTED TO THE U.S. AGGRESSION AGAINST PANAMA. PRESIDENT GARCIA ALSO SAID THAT THE FUEL PRICE INCREASE WILL ALLOW PETROPERU TO OPERATE. WHAT IMPORTANT SUBJECTS WERE DISCUSSED IN THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS MEETING TODAY? THE MAIN SUBJECT WAS THE DECISION TO CALL A SPECIAL CONGRESSIONAL SESSION ON 22 AND 23 DECEMBER TO CONSIDER THE SERIOUS SITUATION CREATED BY THE U.S. INVASION IN PANAMA. THE SECOND IMPORTANT SUBJECT WAS THE DECISION TO DENOUNCE THE TIAR, A MILITARY ORGANIZATION THAT GROUPS ALL THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND THE UNITED STATES AND WHICH, ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, HAS PROVED TO BE ABSOLUTELY INEFFECTIVE AND PARTIAL. THE MALVINAS ISLANDS SITUATION IS A GOOD EXAMPLE. ACCORDING TO THE TIAR, THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE SUPPORTED ARGENTINA, BUT IT DID EXACTLY THE CONTRARY, SUPPORTING THE UNITED KINGDOM. NOW, IN THIS CASE WITH PANAMA, THE TIAR HAS NOT SERVED ANY PURPOSE. RATHER, IT HAS SERVED TO MASK THE U.S. INVASION OF PANAMA. THEREFORE, SINCE WE CONSIDER THE TIAR TO BE INEFFECTIVE AND SENSELESS, WE, AS A REPUBLIC, MUST DENOUNCE IT. WE MUST WITHDRAW OUR SIGNATURE FROM THE TIAR. THIS MUST BE DONE THROUGH CONGRESS, AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE CALLED A SPECIAL SESSION. SEVERAL SECTORS HAVE DESCRIBED THE DECISION TO WITHDRAW THE PERUVIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES AS A HASTY DECISION. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT? I THINK THAT THOSE MUST BE SECTORS COMMITTED TO THE INVASION. THEY MUST SUPPORT A RIGHTIST CONCEPT BY WHICH THE UNITED STATES HAS THE HEGEMONIC RIGHT TO SAFEGUARD OUR DESTINY AND TO DECIDE WHO CAN GOVERN US AND WHO CANNOT. AS PERUVIANS AND LATIN AMERICANS, WE FEEL THAT THE AGGRESSIVE AND BLOODY ACTION BY U.S. TROOPS TO OCCUPY A SMALL COUNTRY IS A VIOLATION. THERE ARE CURRENTLY NEARLY 30,000 U.S. SOLDIERS IN PANAMANIAN TERRITORY. THEY HAVE KILLED MANY PEOPLE AND THEY WANT TO IMPOSE A NEW GOVERNMENT. THUS, AS LONG AS THOSE TROOPS REMAIN THERE, AS LONG AS THIS VIOLATION TO LATIN AMERICA IS MAINTAINED, OUR AMBASSADOR WILL NOT STAY IN THAT COUNTRY. THIS DOES NOT IMPLY A BREAK IN RELATIONS; IT REPRESENTS A CLEAR GESTURE OF CONDEMNATION AND DISLIKE. AS LONG AS A U.S. SOLDIER VIOLATES THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA, WE WILL KEEP OUR AMBASSADOR HERE. AS LONG AS THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT WITHDRAW THEIR TROOPS AND PANAMA REMAINS OCCUPIED, THE PANAMANIAN AND PERUVIAN FLAGS WILL REMAIN TOGETHER. DON'T YOU THINK THAT THIS ATTITUDE COULD HARM CERTAIN RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES; THAT IS, COULDN'T IT JEOPARDIZE THE IMF LOAN? NOT AT ALL. THESE ARE TWO ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT THINGS. THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE IMF ARE ONE THING; THE INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ATTITUDE OF A GOVERNMENT THAT ABUSES ITS ECONOMIC AND MILITARY POWER WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IS SOMETHING ELSE. BESIDES, WE SHOULD MENTION SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT. AS FOR PANAMANIAN-U.S. RELATIONS, THE AMERICANS HAVE BEEN THE MAIN ACCOMPLICES IN DEPRIVING PANAMA OF DEMOCRACY. WHEN ELECTIONS TOOK PLACE IN 1984, WHEN ARNULFO ARIAS SHOULD HAVE WON, THE UNITED STATES DECIDED THAT IT WAS NOT CONVENIENT THAT ARIAS SHOULD WIN, SO A LARGE FRAUD -- AS IT WAS DECLARED AT THE TIME -- WAS CARRIED OUT TO PLACE NICOLAS ARDITO BARLETTA IN POWER. THE FIRST ONES TO RECOGNIZE ARDITO WERE THE AMERICANS. ARDITO WAS PLACED IN THE PRESIDENCY BY NORIEGA. IN 1985 NORIEGA REMOVED ARDITO AND PUT ERIC ARTURO DEL VALLE IN HIS PLACE. THE AMERICANS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED DEL VALLE AS PRESIDENT. THEREFORE, THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN NORIEGA'S ACCOMPLICE IN DEPRIVING PANAMA OF DEMOCRACY. WE DENOUNCED THIS. NORIEGA IS A CREATION OF THE UNITED STATES. IT HAS REPEATEDLY BEEN SAID THAT NORIEGA WORKED WITH THE UNITED STATES AND WITH THE U.S. CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, WHERE PRESIDENT BUSH WAS ONCE CHIEF. THEREFORE, NOW THAT THE MAID IS ANSWERING BACK, MAKING CLAIMS TO THE PANAMA CANAL AND WANTING TO BECOME INDEPENDENT FROM THE UNITED STATES, THE UNITED STATES SUDDENLY DISCOVERS THAT SHE IS A DRUG TRAFFICKER AND THAT SHE DOES NOT SERVE ITS INTERESTS, SO THEY SEND 30,000 U.S. SOLDIERS TO PANAMA. THIS IS AN ABUSE. IT IS A VIOLATION OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF ANOTHER STATE. NO HONORABLE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY SHOULD TOLERATE THIS INVASION WITHOUT ACTIVELY AND OPENLY CONDEMNING IT. ONE WAY TO CONDEMN IT AND EXPRESS DISAPPROVAL OF IT IS TO SAY THAT AS LONG AS THE TROOPS INVADING LATIN AMERICA REMAIN, WE DO NOT NEED TO MAINTAIN OUR AMBASSADOR THERE.
TST1-MUC3-0014	LIMA, 29 MAR 89 -- THE TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT , A PERUVIAN GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION, HAS SENT A LETTER TO PERUVIAN CARDINAL JUAN LANDAZURI, PROPOSING THAT A DIALOGUE BE HELD TO RESTORE PEACE TO PERU. IN ITS LETTER, WHICH IS PARTIALLY PUBLISHED IN TODAY'S LA REPUBLICA, A LIMA NEWSPAPER, THE MRTA OUTLINES SEVERAL CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH IT WILL HOLD A DIALOGUE WITH THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. THE MRTA LETTER IS DATED 26 MARCH, THE SAME DAY CARDINAL LANDAZURI STATED OVER A LOCAL TELEVISION STATION THAT THE CHURCH WOULD BE WILLING TO MEDIATE WITH VIOLENCE-ORIENTED MOVEMENTS UNDER ACCEPTABLE CONDITIONS FOR DIALOGUE. THE CARDINAL ADDED THAT, BECAUSE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE IDEOLOGIES, THESE MOVEMENTS HAVE NOT ENGAGED IN ANY DIALOGUE WHATSOEVER. HE ALSO NOTED THAT APPEALS MADE BY THE CHURCH HAVE GONE UNHEEDED. ACCORDING TO LA REPUBLICA, THE MRTA LETTER SAYS THAT THE MRTA "NATIONAL LEADERSHIP CAREFULLY LISTENED TO YOUR EASTER MESSAGE TO THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY IN WHICH YOU REFLECTED ON THE PROBLEM OF VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY, AND MADE AN APPEAL TO THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN UP ARMS." THUS, THE LETTER ADDS, THE MRTA "DEEMS IT IMPORTANT TO INFORM YOU OF OUR OPINION AND OUR PROPOSALS IN THIS REGARD." THE LETTER SAYS THAT THE CHURCH MUST PLAY A DECISIVE ROLE IN "HUMANIZING THIS WAR," AND THAT MOST VICTIMS OF THIS WAR ARE "UNARMED CIVILIANS." THE MRTA BELIEVES THAT IN ORDER TO HUMANIZE THIS CONFLICT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES MUST "STOP COMMITTING CRIMES AGAINST UNARMED CIVILIANS, PRISONERS MUST BE TREATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE VIENNA CONVENTION, TORTURE AND HUMAN RIGHTS' CRIMES MUST END, AND PARAMILITARY GANGS MUST BE DISMANTLED." THE MRTA ASKS THE CHURCH TO DEMAND THAT THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT CHANGE ITS ECONOMIC POLICY. THE MRTA SAYS: "THE CHURCH MUST DEMAND THAT THE GOVERNMENT PUT AN END TO REPRESSION AND CRIMES AGAINST THE PEOPLE; THAT HIGH MORAL STANDARDS BE OBSERVED IN ALL ASPECTS OF PERUVIAN POLITICAL LIFE; AND THAT STIFF PUNISHMENT BE GIVEN TO THOSE WHO COMMIT IMMORAL, CRIMINAL ACTS AGAINST THE PEOPLE." THE MRTA LETTER CONCLUDES BY STATING THAT ONLY THIS WAY WILL THE CHURCH TRULY "CONTRIBUTE TO FINDING A SOLUTION TO THIS CONFRONTATION." MONSIGNOR RICARDO DURAND FLORES, PRESIDENT OF THE PERUVIAN EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE, TODAY SAID THAT THE CHURCH "CANNOT REJECT ANY PROPOSAL FROM VIOLENCE-ORIENTED ORGANIZATIONS." MSGR DURAND SAID THAT IF SUCH A PROPOSAL IS MADE THE EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE WILL IMMEDIATELY CALL A MEETING OF ITS STANDING COMMITTEE "TO STUDY THE SITUATION." VICTOR POLAY, ONE OF THE MRTA'S LEADERS, IS CURRENTLY IN CUSTODY AND FACING TRIAL ON CHARGES OF TERRORISM. MORE THAN 13,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN PERU SINCE 1980, WHEN THE MAOIST SHINING PATH ORGANIZATION STARTED ITS WAVE OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE, WHICH HAS ALSO CAUSED HEAVY MATERIAL DAMAGE.
TST1-MUC3-0015	GUATEMALA CITY, 30 SEP 89 -- THE GUATEMALAN GUERRILLAS TODAY PROPOSED "BEGINNING A DIALOGUE PROCESS AND TALKS" AMONG THE VARIOUS SECTORS OF THE COUNTRY TO TRY AND PUT AN END TO "REPRESSION, TERROR, AND VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND TO BEGIN A REAL DEMOCRATIC PROCESS." THE GUATEMALAN REBELS PROPOSED HOLDING "MEETINGS ON DATES TO BE AGREED UPON AND IN A COUNTRY THAT WILL GUARANTEE THE NECESSARY SAFETY AND OFFER ITS TERRITORY TO HOLD THE MEETINGS" TO DISCUSS "VITAL" ISSUES, SUCH AS HOW TO END THE REPRESSION AND THE INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICT. THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY HAS ALSO REITERATED TO CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT VINICIO CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT ITS WILLINGNESS TO ATTEND A DIALOGUE TO REACH AN AGREEMENT ON A CEASE-FIRE; HOWEVER, IT REGRETS THE FACT THAT UP TO NOW, "THE PRESIDENT AND HIS DEFENSE MINISTER, GENERAL ALEJANDRO GRAMAJO, HAVE REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION." GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT AND URNG REPRESENTATIVES MET FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MADRID, SPAIN, IN 1987, BUT THE MEETING ENDED WITHOUT SPECIFIC AGREEMENTS BEING REACHED. "WE HAVE INSISTED ON A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE URNG BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, EVEN THOUGH ALL OF CENTRAL AMERICA IS WILLING TO HOLD DIALOGUES, PRESIDENT CEREZO AND THE GRAMAJO CLIQUE REFUSE TO DO SO," THE URNG STATED IN A PAID ADVERTISEMENT PUBLISHED IN LOCAL NEWSPAPERS. IN REFERENCE TO THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE THAT IS SWEEPING THE COUNTRY, THE URNG, MADE UP OF FOUR REBEL GROUPS THAT OPERATE IN GUATEMALA, SAID THAT THE PEOPLE "ARE LIVING ONE OF THE DARKEST AND DEADLIEST CHAPTERS IN THEIR HISTORY." WITHIN THIS CONTEXT, THE URNG GENERAL COMMAND "FEELS THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERTAKE A PROCESS OF DIALOGUE AND TALKS WITH ALL THE FORCES AND POLITICAL PARTIES, WITH ALL THE POPULAR, RELIGIOUS, BUSINESS GROUPS, AND WITH THE HONEST SOLDIERS, SO THAT TOGETHER WE CAN FIND A REAL ALTERNATIVE TO THE CURRENT SITUATION." "THE ISSUES TO BE DISCUSSED COULD INCLUDE -- IN ADDITION TO THE VITAL ISSUES LIKE REPRESSION AND THE INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICT -- ECONOMIC MEASURES THAT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT, WITHOUT PRESSURES OR IMF MEASURES, OF A PROSPEROUS ECONOMY," THE GUERRILLA'S STATEMENT ADDS. "WITH 16 MONTHS AND A FEW DAYS LEFT IN THE CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL TERM, PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT HAS NOT LIVED UP TO ITS PROMISES AND HAS ONLY MADE THE SITUATION WORSE," THE REBEL COMMUNIQUE STATES. "INSTEAD OF CHANGES, REPRESSION, TERROR, INSTABILITY, CHAOS, AND CORRUPTION CONTINUE, AND THE GUATEMALAN PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF LIES, FRUSTRATION, AND MANIPULATION," THE REBELS ADD. THE URNG STATED THAT CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT, THE FIRST CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY HAS HAD SINCE 1970, HAS PROVEN ITSELF TO BE "A COUNTERINSURGENT, REPRESSIVE, AND TERRORIST REGIME." THE GUATEMALAN REBELS BELIEVE THAT "THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NEW WAVE OF REPRESSION AND TERROR THAT ONLY ADDS TO THE MORE THAN 100,000 PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN MURDERED, 40,000 WHO HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED OR ARE MISSING, 1 MILLION LOCALLY DISPLACED AND 46,000 WHO HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE IN MEXICO SINCE 1954." THE URNG TODAY ALSO PUBLISHED A COPY OF A LETTER SENT TO UN SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR IN WHICH IT REQUESTS THAT HE OFFER HIS GOOD OFFICES "SO THAT A REGIME THAT RESPECTS HUMAN RIGHTS, THE INTERNATIONAL NORMS AND CONVENTIONS, JUSTICE, FREEDOM, AND DEMOCRACY WILL PREVAIL IN GUATEMALA." THE REBELS SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S ASSURANCE THAT THE REBEL MOVEMENT HAS BEEN ANNIHILATED "IS NOT TRUE" AND ADDED THAT, QUITE THE CONTRARY, "THE POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY WAR HAS INCREASED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY." THE URNG CLAIMS THAT "THE URNG MILITARY GROUPS ARE NOW FIGHTING IN 11 OF THE 22 DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING GUATEMALA CITY," AND HAVE CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR ATTACKS ON "IMPORTANT TARGETS." ACCORDING TO ITS MILITARY REPORT, THE URNG HAS CARRIED OUT APPROXIMATELY 688 MILITARY ACTIONS AND INFLICTED 1,172 CASUALTIES ON THE ARMY SINCE LAST APRIL. THE GUATEMALAN ARMY CLAIMS THAT THE REBELS HAVE BEEN MILITARILY DEFEATED AND THAT ONLY ABOUT 1,000 REBELS ARE ACTIVE IN SOME ISOLATED REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY. TODAY'S STATEMENT WAS SIGNED BY ROLANDO MORAN, GASPAR ILOM, CARLOS GONZALEZ, AND PABLO MONSANTO, COMMANDERS OF THE FOUR CLANDESTINE ORGANIZATIONS THAT MAKE UP THE URNG: THE POOR PEOPLE'S GUERRILLA ARMY , THE REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION OF THE PEOPLE IN ARMS , THE GUATEMALAN LABOR PARTY , AND THE REBEL ARMED FORCES .
TST1-MUC3-0016	CLANDESTINE, 23 NOV 89 -- THE OFFICERS AND EVERYONE ELSE IN THE ARMY MUST THINK THIS OVER. THEY CANNOT CONTINUE CLOSING THEIR EYES TO THE BOMBINGS, TO THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEFT THE POOR NEIGHBORHOODS OF SAN SALVADOR, TO THE MOTHERS WHO APPEAR CRYING ON TELEVISION. IT IS GOOD THAT THE NETWORK PRESENTS THESE PICTURES OF PEOPLE CRYING, MANIPULATING THEIR EMOTIONS. THOSE TEARS WERE SHED OVER 50 YEARS OF OPPRESSION AND MISERY, AND OVER THE BOMBINGS THAT HAVE DESTROYED ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD. OFFICERS, THE BOMBS HAVE CAUSED ALL THAT SORROW AND THE DESTRUCTION OF 500 HOUSES IN ZACAMIL. AS WE WERE SAYING, OFFICERS, YOU MUST ASK YOURSELVES: WHO ARE YOU DYING FOR? FOR COLONEL PONCE'S MANSIONS IN MIAMI? FOR GENERAL BUSTILLO'S MANSIONS? WHY ARE THE ARMED FORCES MEMBERS DYING HERE? WHY ARE THE LIEUTENANTS, THE CAPITAINS DYING, WHILE THE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES HIERARCHY ARE CONFORTABLY SITTING IN THEIR AIR-CONDITIONED OFFICES BEING GUARDED WHILE THEY ARE AT EASE, BUT NOT REALLY AT EASE AS COMBAT IS TAKING PLACE JUST A FEW BLOCKS FROM THEIR OFFICE. OFFICERS, LIEUTENANTS, CAPTAINS, THIS IS THE APPEAL THE FMLN WANTS MAKE TO YOU TODAY, AT A TIME WHEN THE FUTURE OF THE FATHERLAND IS AT STAKE? YOU MUST THINK THIS OVER, YOU MUST MAKE A DECISION, AND YOU MUST DO THIS SOON. HISTORY IS MOVING FAST, AND THE TIME IS RIPE. SO WHEN YOU ARE TOLD THAT YOU ARE DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION, THINK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE TELLING YOU. IF YOU ARE DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION, THINK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE SAYING. IF WE ARE DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION HERE, WHY IS THIS CONSTITUTION BEING VIOLATED BY THOSE RAMBOS SENT BY PRESIDENT BUSH TO EL SALVADOR? YOU ALL KNOW THIS LITTLE GROUP OF RAMBOS IS GOOD FOR NOTHING, AS THEY ARE COWARDS. THEY DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE THE SHERATON HOTEL, BECAUSE THE GUERRILLAS WERE THERE. THEY ARE COWARDS, JUST LIKE THEIR SYSTEM. THEY ARE TINHORN RAMBOS, WHO ARE ABSOLUTELY NO GOOD. AS WE SAID YESTERDAY, IF THOSE MEN WHO LEFT THE SHERATON LIKE COMMON CRIMINALS COVERING THEIR FACES FROM THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS ARE THE ONES WHO ARE TRAINING THE ARMED FORCES, WE CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER WHY THE FMLN IS DEFEATING THE TACTICS TAUGHT BY THEM. THEY ARE NO GOOD, BECAUSE THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND OUR PEOPLE, THEY UNDERESTIMATE OUR PEOPLE. OFFICERS, YOU KNOW THOSE U.S. ADVISERS UNDERESTIMATE YOU, THEY LOOK DOWN ON YOU, AS LITTLE INDIANS, AS DONKEYS. YOU KNOW HOW THEY THINK OF YOU. YOU KOW THEY MOCK THE SALVADORAN OFFICERS. OFFICERS, YOU KNOW VERY WELL HOW THESE U.S. ADVISERS TREAT OUR SOLDIERS. THEY ARE HAUGHTY, ARROGANT, AND COWARDS. YOU SAW THEM AT THE SHERATON HOTEL, PISSING IN THEIR PANTS, THEY DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE THE HOTEL. A COMMISSION WENT THERE, THE RED CROSS WENT THERE, BUT THEY DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE, BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT SURE OF THEMSELVES DURING THE TRUCE, SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE COWARDS. WE WANT THE CIN , THAT FASCIST NETWORK THAT IS SILENCING OUR PEOPLE, TO PRESENT THE FILMS OF THE ADVISORS LEAVING THE HOTEL. WE CHALLENGE THE NETWORK TO PRESENT THOSE FILMS OF THE ADVISORS LEAVING THE SHERATON, WITH THEIR FACES COVERED AS IF THEY WERE CAR THIEVES. THAT IS THE WAY THE U.S. ADVISERS -- THE RAMBOS, THE SUPERMEN -- LEFT THE SHERATON. THESE RAMBOS ARE NOT GOING TO SAVE ANYONE, AS THEY CANNOT EVEN SAVE THEMSELVES.
TST1-MUC3-0017	CLANDESTINE, 12 NOV 89 -- THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND REPORTS: 1. ON SATURDAY 11 NOVEMBER WE BEGAN THE NATIONAL MILITARY CAMPAIGN CALLED " OUT WITH THE FASCISTS! FEBE ELIZABETH LIVES!" THIS CAMPAIGN IMMERSED THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND AND THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION IN CONFUSION AND INSECURITY SINCE THE BEGINNING; AND IT SUCCESSFULLY CONTINUES IN ITS SECOND DAY OF FIGHTING. 2. THE FMLN FIGHTERS ARE USING ALL THEIR INTELLIGENCE, ENERGY, UNSELFISHNESS, AND PATRIOTISM SO THAT A JUST PEACE IS ACHIEVED IN THE COUNTRY BASED ON AN AUTHENTIC DEMOCRACY DESIGNED TO COUNTER THE GENOCIDAL REPLY THAT THE MILITARY DICTATORSHIP HAS RESPONDED WITH. 3. SALVADORANS WHO HAVE WITHSTOOD A BLOODY MILITARY DICTATORSHIP FOR ALMOST 60 YEARS SEE MORE CLEARLY TODAY THE NEED TO DEVELOP THEIR LEGITIMATE DEFENSE AGAINST THE REPRESSION WHICH HAS BEEN STEPPED UP BY THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND MILITARY HOSTILITY OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S ADMINISTRATION; AND THEY UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO SUPPORT AND JOIN THE STRUGGLE FOR OUR COUNTRY'S LIBERTY. 4. WE URGE THE HONEST AND PATRIOTIC MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES TO SERIOUSLY REFLECT ON THE FACT THAT THEY ARE NOT ONLY FACING THE GUERRILLA ARMY OF THE FMLN, BUT A WHOLE SECTOR WHICH CLAIMS ITS RIGHT TO REBEL. WE SPECIFICALLY URGE THE SOLDIERS AND OFFICERS IN THE BATTLEFIELD TO UNDERSTAND THAT OUR STRUGGLE IS NOT BEING PERSONALLY WAGED AGAINST YOU, BUT RATHER AGAINST THE ANTIPOPULAR INTERESTS WHICH ARE BEING DEFENDED BY THE ARMED FORCES UPON ORDERS FROM THE FASCISTS. 5. THE GOVERNMENTS AND PEOPLES OF THE WORLD ARE CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE LATEST EVENTS IN EL SALVADOR AND THEIR CONTRIBUTION WILL BE VALUABLE IN ACHIEVING A NATIONAL CONSENSUS BASED ON DEMOCRACY, A SOLUTION AMONG SALVADORANS, AND NO FOREIGN INTERVENTION. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST HELP ACHIEVE A JUST AND DURABLE PEACE, THUS AVOIDING MORE BLOODSHED. 6. THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND WANTS TO REPORT THE ATROCITIES BEING PERPETRATED AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION BY THE ARMED FORCES WHO ARE INDISCRIMINATELY BOMBING DENSELY POPULATED AREAS IN SAN SALVADOR, AND ISSUING DEATH THREATS AGAINST ALL THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL GROUPS, THUS PROVING THE REGIME'S WEAKNESS AND SHOWING ITS ANTIPOPULAR AND ANTIPATRIOTIC ESSENCE. 7. WE ALSO URGE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO HELP CREATE SPECIAL ZONES WHERE CHILDREN, THE ELDERLY, AND WOUNDED PEOPLE FROM THE BATTLE ZONES CAN BE EVACUATED. OUT WITH THE FASCISTS! FEBE ELIZABETH LIVES! FMLN GENERAL COMMAND COMMANDERS SALVADOR SANCHEZ CEREN, COMMANDER FRANCISCO JOVEL, COMMANDER JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, COMMANDER SHAFIK JORGE HANDAL, COMMANDER EDUARDO SANCHO. EL SALVADOR, 12 NOVEMBER 1989.
TST1-MUC3-0018	SAN SALVADOR, 26 MAY 90 -- TO DATE, THE ARMY HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF A REPORT THAT THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT HAS SAID IT SENT TO PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ON THE INVESTIGATIONS CARRIED OUT IN THAT COUNTRY CONCERNING THE DEATH OF SALVADORAN LEFTIST LEADER HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES. OQUELI, LEADER OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT AND HILDA FLORES, A GUATEMALAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER WERE ABDUCTED AND KILLED IN JANUARY BY UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS IN GUATEMALA CITY AS THEY WERE HEADING TO THE LA AURORA AIRPORT. PRESIDENT CEREZO WAS IN CARACAS ON THE OCCASION OF THE MEETING BETWEEN THE FMLN-FDR AND A DELEGATION OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT. ON THAT OCCASION PRESIDENT CEREZO MET WITH BOTH DELEGATIONS SEPARATELY. HE INFORMED THEM ABOUT THE INVESTIGATIONS BEING CONDUCTED CONCERNING THE CRIME AND TOLD THEM THAT HE WOULD SEND HIS GOVERNMENT'S VERSION TO PRESIDENT CRISTIANI. SINCE PRESIDENT CEREZO TOLD JOURNALISTS THAT "SALVADORAN RIGHTIST SECTORS AND SOLDIERS" COULD BE IMPLICATED IN THE CRIME, YESTERDAY ARMY SPOKESMEN WERE ASKED TO COMMENT ON THE SUBJECT. THEY SAID THAT ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE HEARD SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT, THEY HAVE NO SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE REPORT, WHICH THEY EXPECT TO SEE SOON, IF IT IS NOT JUST SPECULATION.
TST1-MUC3-0019	SAN SALVADOR, 26 JAN 90 -- AFTER NEARLY A 2-MONTH ABSENCE FROM THE NATIONAL PRESS, MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON HOLDS THE VIEW THAT THE ARMED FORCES SHOULD NOT BE CRITICIZED FOR THE ISOLATED BEHAVIOR OF SOME OF ITS MEMBERS. THE ARENA LEADER IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE ARMED FORCES THEMSELVES WERE THE ONES THAT EXERTED PRESSURE SO THAT THE JESUITS' MURDER CASE COULD BE CLEARED-UP. IT WAS NOT THE INSTITUTION THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THE PROBLEM. REGRETTABLY SOME OF ITS MEMBERS DID IT AND NOW THE ENTIRE ARMED FORCES ARE UNDER PRESSURE FOR POLITICAL REASONS. HOWEVER, WE MUST REALIZE THAT IT IS THANKS TO THE ARMED FORCES THAT WE HAVE THIS DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, WITH A HOPE THAT OUR COUNTRY DEVELOPS AND RECOVERS. IT IS VERY UNFAIR THAT SOME PEOPLE PASS JUDGMENT OR CRITICIZE WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING HOW HARD IT HAS BEEN ON ALL THE OFFICERS, NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND TROOPS WHO HAVE HAD TO PUT UP WITH THESE ATTACKS IN ADDITION TO THE INTENSE WORK THEY HAVE HAD FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS. D'AUBUISSON SAID THAT ONCE THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS HAS BEEN CLEARED UP, U.S. AUTHORITIES HAVE NO REASON TO QUESTION THE CONTINUATION OF U.S. ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO THE COUNTRY. THE JESUITS' CASE WAS A DETERMINING FACTOR. BUT NOW THAT THE CASE HAS BEEN FULLY SOLVED WITH THE HELP OF THE FBI, SCOTLAND YARD, AND INVESTIGATORS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, THIS IS NO LONGER A PROBLEM, ALTHOUGH PREVIOUSLY IT WAS SERIOUS. I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE CAN BE ANY DOUBT NOW ABOUT RECEIVING THE AID, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE TREMENDOUS OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FMLN . FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE, IF THE SITUATION DID ARISE , THIS WOULD ONLY FAVOR THE FMLN. I KNOW THE FMLN HAS A WHOLE RANGE OF SUPPORT GROUPS THAT HANDLE DISINFORMATION AND MAKE IT APPEAR AS IF THINGS HERE WERE DISASTROUS. FOR EXAMPLE, INFORMATION ABROAD IS THAT THE AIR FORCE LEVELED ALL THE NEIGHBORHOODS. WE SALVADORANS KNOW THAT THE AIR FORCE WAS EXCESSIVELY CAUTIOUS AND DID AN EXCELLENT JOB REPELLING THIS ATTACK WITH A MINIMUM OF CIVILIANS WOUNDED. FOR THAT MATTER, IF WE ARE GOING TO COMPARE THINGS, U.S. MILITARY OPERATIONS IN PANAMA WERE MORE CLUMSY -- THERE THEY SET A WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD ON FIRE. THE ARENA LEADER ALSO DENIED THAT THERE WERE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRESIDENT CRISTIANI AND HIMSELF. ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL PRESS AGENCIES, THE DECISION OF THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT TO PROSECUTE THE MILITARY MEN INVOLVED IN THE JESUITS' MURDER CAUSED DIVISION WITHIN THE PARTY. D'AUBUISSON DENIED THIS WAS TRUE. NOT IN THE LEAST. THERE HAVE NEVER BEEN ANY DIFFERENCES WITH PRESIDENT CRISTIANI. ON THE CONTRARY, WE ARE VERY CLOSE AND GRATEFUL FOR THE GREAT EFFORT, WORK, AND THE MAGNIFICENT JOB PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IS DOING. THIS IS REASON FOR PRIDE NOT ONLY AMONG FRIENDS OF PRESIDENT CRISTIANI BUT FOR THE PARTY AND FRIENDS OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT. IN COMMENTING ON THE DIALOGUE WITH THE FMLN, D'AUBUISSON SUPPORTED PRESIDENT CRITIANI'S INITIATIVE OF ENGAGING THE ASSISTANCE OF THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL. I DO NOT THINK HE HAS THE TIME TO ACT AS MEDIATOR; HOWEVER, HE COULD ACT AS A GUARANTOR, RECEIVING RESULTS OF THESE TALKS AND ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMMITMENTS MADE. MAJ ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON, CURRENTLY AN ARENA DEPUTY, SAID THAT THIS YEAR HE WILL DEDICATE HIS TIME TO EXPAND AND REORGANIZE THE PARTY TO GET READY FOR THE 1991 MUNICIPAL AND PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS. HE WILL MOST LIKELY NOT BE AN ARENA DEPUTY IN THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE PERIOD, BECAUSE HE, ALONG WITH OTHER FORMER LEGISLATORS, WILL CONCENTRATE THEIR POLITICAL ACTIVITIES ON THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PARLIAMENT.
TST1-MUC3-0020	SAN SALVADOR, 11 NOV 89 -- THE ARMED FORCES HAVE EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL. WE HAVE TOURED THE ENTIRE AREA; SOME HAVE ELECTRICITY, AND OTHERS DO NOT. THE REBELS HAVE TRIED TO CREATE A SITUATION. HOWEVER, NOTHING HAS HAPPENED BECAUSE THE ARMED FORCES CONTROL EVERYTHING. THIS IS A REPORT FROM THE ENTIRE AREA WHERE THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO CREATE A SITUATION OF HARASSMENT, AND THAT IS WHAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE REPORTING TONIGHT. IN A CERTAIN SECTOR, IN THE VICINITY OF SANTA TECLA OR, THE ENTIRE SITUATION THAT IS BEING EXPERIENCED TONIGHT. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE CAN REST ASSURED THAT THE ARMED FORCES CONTROL EVERYTHING; THERE ARE ONLY SOME BOMBINGS AND SHOOTINGS THAT WILL NOT LEAD TO ANYTHING. THIS IS ONLY BEING DONE TO MAKE THE PEOPLE FEEL AS IF THERE WERE SITUATIONS THAT ARE NOT DIFFERENT AT ALL, BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT LEAD TO ANYTHING, THE SITUATION, RIGHT? THAT IS THE REPORT WE CAN GIVE YOU NOW, WHILE WE ARE EXPERIENCING THE POWER OUTTAGE, AND THE REBLS ARE BRINGING EVERYTHING TO A STANDSTILL, BUT THIS WILL NOT LEAD TO ANYTHING THAT WOULD MAKE THE PEOPLE FEEL THAT THERE IS AN ALARMING SITUATION. I AM REPORTING LIVE FROM THE AREA OF THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY AND JARDINES LA SULTANA, WHERE THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY AT PRESENT. WE HAVE MADE A GREAT EFFORT TO CONTACT YOU BY TELEPHONE AS WE KNOW THIS IS THE STATION THAT IS HEARD THROUGHOUT EL SALVADOR AND OUTSIDE OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS THE SITUATION AT PRESENT. EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL. THERE ARE NO PROBLEMS. IT IS JUST A HARASSMENT BY THE REBELS WHO ARE TRYING TO SCARE PEOPLE. EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL.
TST1-MUC3-0021	SAN SALVADOR, 8 AUG 89 -- FMLN COMMUNIQUE TO ALL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE: CONCERNING THE TELA AGREEMENTS, THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND HEREBY STATES THE FOLLOWING: 1. THESE AGREEMENTS ARE A VICTORY FOR THE REVOLUTIONARY, PROGRESSIVE, INDEPENDENT, AND DEMOCRATIC FORCES OF THE REGION, AND AS SUCH, WE STRONGLY PRAISE THEM. 2. THESE AGREEMENTS SEAL THE POLITICAL DEATH OF THE CONTRAS AND DECLARE TO THE WORLD THE FAILURE OF THE POLICY OF AGGRESSION THAT THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION INITIATED AND CARRIED OUT AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF CENTRAL AMERICA. 3. ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES WERE PREPARED TO PUT FORWARD A THEORY OF PARALLELS, ALL OF THEIR ALLEGED EVIDENCE WAS DERIDED AND DISCARDED. 4. CRISTIANI HAS SIGNED OFF ON THE CONTRAS' DEATH AND ACKNOWLEDGED BEFORE THE ENTIRE WORLD THAT THE FMLN IS A FORCE WITH WHICH IT MUST TALK AND NEGOTIATE. HE WENT TO TELA WITH A DIALOGUE PLAN TO COVER UP THE WAR, BUT HE WAS FORCED, UNDER THE AGREEMENTS, TO NEGOTIATE FOR PEACE WITH THE FMLN. CRISTIANI'S DIALOGUE COMMISSION, IN FACT, HAS BEEN DEMOBILIZED. 5. CRISTIANI WAS FORCED TO SIGN A PLEDGE FOR DEMOCRATIZATION WHEN HIS PLANS WAS TO FASCISTIZE EL SALVADOR. 6. THE FMLN REAFFIRMS ITS RESOLVE TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES, THE SAN SALVADOR ARCHBISHOPRIC, AND OTHER SOCIAL FORCES TO ESTABLISH A DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE CONTRAS WERE A MERCENARY FORCE MAINTAINED BY THE UNITED STATES, WHICH ATTACKED NICARAGUA FROM HONDURAS, AND WHICH SHOULD AND COULD BE DEMOBILIZED. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE FMLN IS A NATIONAL FORCE THAT HAS REASONS FOR BEING AT WAR, AND WITH WHICH PEACE MUST BE NEGOTIATED. NO ONE CAN DEMOBILIZE THE FMLN BECAUSE IT IS WITHIN THE COUNTRY AND IS A LEGITIMATE NATIONAL FORCE. THE FMLN CALLS ON ALL FELLOW PATRIOTS WHO HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE IN HONDURAS, NICARAGUA, COSTA RICA, GUATEMALA, AND THE REST OF THE WORLD TO RETURN TO THE FATHERLAND. THEY ARE PROTECTED BY THE TELA AGREEMENTS. WE ASK ALL SALVADORANS TO DEMAND OF CRISTIANI THAT, WITHOUT FURTHER STRATAGEMS, HE CARRY OUT A SERIOUS NEGOTIATION; FULFILL HIS PLEDGE TO DEMOCRATIZE THE COUNTRY; STOP THE REPRESSION, KIDNAPPING, AND TORTURE; RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS; GUARANTEE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION; RESPECT REFORM; AND ABOLISH THE ECONOMIC MEASURES THAT ARE DEEPENING THE WAR. FMLN GENERAL COMMAND 7 AUGUST 1989
TST1-MUC3-0022	SAN SALVADOR, 15 MAR 89 -- SEVERAL HUNDRED ACTIVISTS OF THE RADICAL BREAD, LAND, WORK, AND FREEDOM MOVEMENT MARCHED THROUGH THE STREETS OF SAN SALVADOR ON TUESDAY, OPENLY DEFYING THE GOVERNMENT AND CONDEMNING "THE ELECTION FARCE" OF 19 MARCH. PEASANTS, WHOSE HARDENED FACES AND BODIES REVEAL THE ENDURANCE OF LONG WORK DAYS, PARTICIPATED IN THE MARCH ALONG WITH WOMEN, WHO IN MANY CASES WERE CARRYING THEIR BABIES WHO NEVER KNEW THEIR FATHERS BECAUSE THEY ARE MISSING OR BECAUSE THEY WERE MURDERED BY SECURITY FORCES OR DEATH SQUADS, ACCORDING TO WHAT THEY TOLD AFP. YOUNG PEOPLE OF BOTH SEXES MARCHED ALONG WITH THEM SHOUTING SLOGANS AND WITH THEIR FACES COVERED WITH RED HANDKERCHIEFS. THEY CARRIED IRON RODS AND MOLOTOV COCKTAILS IN THEIR BAGS, "IN CASE THEY WERE NEEDED TO CONFRONT THE POLICE OR IN CASE THEY HAD TO CHARGE AGAINST A GOVERNMENT VEHICLE." IN THEIR STRING BAGS, THE YOUNG PEOPLE -- SOME OF WHOM CAME DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINS IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS TO PROMOTE THE REACTIVATION OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE MASSES -- ALSO CARRIED SPRAY PAINT CANS, WHICH THEY WERE READY TO USE TO PAINT SLOGANS ON WALLS AND VEHICLES AT THE SLIGHTEST OPPORTUNITY. "WHAT IS OUR BATTLE CRY? BREAD, LAND, WORK, AND FREEDOM," THEY SHOUTED AS THEY MARCHED DOWN THE MAIN AVENUES OF THE CAPITAL CARRYING HUGE RED FLAGS WITH A BLACK CIRCLE IN THE CENTER, THE MPTTL SYMBOL. ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES AND HIGH PARTY LEADERS, THE MPTTL DEMONSTRATORS ARE "A MINORITY, INSTRUMENTS OF THE TERRORISTS OR SIMPLY GUERRILLAS THAT CAME DOWN THE MOUNTAINS TO PROMOTE CHAOS." LEFTIST LEADERS, HOWEVER, SAID THE MARCH HELD TODAY WAS THE "EXPRESSION OF THE MAJORITY OF THE 5 MILLION SALVADORANS, A MAJORITY, WHICH FOR MANY YEARS, SINCE THE 1932 MASSACRE, HAS BEEN SUBJUGATED BY RIFLES AND HUNGER BUT IS NOW AWAKENING."
TST1-MUC3-0023	BOGOTA, 27 APR 90 -- THE MEDIA CAN MAKE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TOWARD PEACE AND DEMOCRACY IF, ON THEIR OWN INITIATIVE, THEY LAUNCH A GREAT CIVIC CAMPAIGN TO VIGOROUSLY STIMULATE THE CITIZENS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COMING ELECTIONS. FELLOW CITIZENS, I KNOW THAT YOU ARE ASKING YOURSELVES WHAT CAN BE DONE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. ABOVE ALL, DO NOT PLAY UP TO TERRORISM. THE INTERESTS OF THE FATHERLAND ARE ABOVE ALL INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP INTERESTS, AS IS THE DEFENSE OF OUR DEMOCRACY, WHICH WE HAVE ALL BEEN BUILDING TOGETHER FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY. THIS CANNOT BE THE TIME OF OPPORTUNISM. THIS IS THE HOUR OF SOLIDARITY WITH THE COUNTRY, ITS PEOPLE, AND ITS INSTITUTIONS. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE MEASURES AND THE ACTIONS OF THE PUBLIC FORCE DEPEND, FIRST OF ALL, ON THE SOLIDARITY OF THE CITIZENS. THE RESULTS WILL BE AS ENCOURAGING AND AS FAVORABLE AS THE COOPERATION OF THE CITIZENS. TO REGAIN TRANQUILITY IS NOT THE EXCLUSIVE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ARMED FORCES OR THE STATE. IT IS A TASK IN WHICH EACH OF US HAS SOMETHING TO CONTRIBUTE. COLOMBIA HAS SUCCESSFULLY OVERCOME EVEN MORE DIFFICULT MOMENTS. IT HAS FACED DECISIVELY AND EMERGED VICTORIOUSLY FROM EVEN MORE UNCERTAIN SITUATIONS. THAT PAST HAS CREATED SOLID INSTITUTIONS. FOR THIS REASON, I AM SURE THAT DEMOCRACY WILL TRIUMPH AND THAT THOSE WHO COMMIT VIOLENCE, REGARDLESS OF WHO THEY MAY BE, WILL BE PUNISHED. I AM SURE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROGRESS ALONG THE PATH OF PEACE, TOLERANCE, AND RESPECT FOR LIFE AND HUMAN DIGNITY. GOOD NIGHT.
TST1-MUC3-0024	BOGOTA, 8 DEC 89 -- THE CAR BOMB ATTACK ON 6 DECEMBER WHICH DESTROYED THE BUILDING THAT HOUSES THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY HAD BEEN PLANNED SINCE LAST SEPTEMBER, ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL DISCLOSURES. A POLICE SPOKESPERSON CONFIRMED TODAY THAT THE BUS USED IN THE TERRORIST ACTION WAS BOUGHT BY A MAN WHO IS A NATIVE OF MEDELLIN. HE USED FALSE DOCUMENTS TO BUY THE CAR FROM A SCHOOL PROPRIETOR IN BOGOTA. ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES, THE BUYER, WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE SINISTER MEDELLIN CARTEL, WAS INSTRUCTED BY TERRORISTS ABROAD TO EXPLODE 500 KG OF DYNAMITE GEL IN FRONT OF THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE COUNTRY'S PRINCIPAL SECURITY ORGANIZATION. DAS DIRECTOR BRIGADIER GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ SAID ON 7 DECEMBER THAT A MEMBER OF THE SEPARATIST ETA GROUP DIRECTED THE OPERATION. MAZA MARQUEZ ALSO SAID THAT PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA AND GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, THE WORLD'S BIGGEST DRUG TRAFFICKERS, "ARE BEHIND THIS CRIMINAL ATTACK." "THE MEDELLIN CARTEL PLANNED THE ATTACK SINCE SEPTEMBER, AFTER ANOTHER CAR BOMB ATTEMPT TO ASSASSINATE MAZA MARQUEZ WAS FOILED LAST MAY," THE POLICE SPOKESPERSON STATED. MEANWHILE, THREE PERSONS SUSPECTED OF PARTICIPATING IN THE ATTACK WERE RELEASED ON 7 DECEMBER, AFTER BEING FOUND INNOCENT. TWO OTHER PERSONS ARE BEING HELD BY THE POLICE AND ARE UNDERGOING INTENSE QUESTIONING. THE AUTHORITIES ALSO CONFIRMED THAT THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS IS 59 AND NOT 62, AS WAS REPORTED OFFICIALLY ON 7 DECEMBER. CIVIL DEFENSE AND RED CROSS CREWS, AS WELL AS ARMED FORCES UNITS, ARE REMOVING THE RUBBLE FROM A 2-KM-PERIMETER, FEARING THAT PEOPLE MAY BE PERSONS TRAPPED BENEATH TONS OF IRON AND CEMENT.
TST1-MUC3-0025	BOGOTA, 22 SEP 89 -- SECURITY MEASURES IN THE CAPITAL HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY BEEFED UP AFTER THE MILITARY AND POLICE FORCES DISCOVERED A TERRORIST PLAN AGAINST A STATE INSTITUTION. GENERAL RAMON NIEBLES UZCATEGUI, COMMANDER OF THE 13TH BRIGADE, REPORTED THAT THE PLAN WAS DISCOVERED FOLLOWING INVESTIGATIONS IN SOUTHWESTERN BOGOTA, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY AT CARVAJAL DISTRICT, WHERE THE POLICE DISCOVERED A CAR WITH 100 KG OF GELIGNITE AT A RESIDENCE. THE CAR HAD A SLOW-BURNING FUSE AND MECHANISMS TO SET IT OFF. DURING THE SAME INVESTIGATION, THE AUTHORITIES FOUND A TOYOTA CAMPER WITH 15 KG OF DYNAMITE, A POWERFUL MOTORCYCLE, AND OTHER ITEMS TYPICAL OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.
TST1-MUC3-0026	BOGOTA, 24 AUG 89 -- THE PRESENCE OF BRITISH AND ISRAELI MERCENARIES, PAID BY COLOMBIAN EXTREME RIGHT-WING GROUPS AND DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WAS CONFIRMED TODAY BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY , COLOMBIA'S SECRET POLICE. THE DAS SENT A CONFIDENTIAL REPORT TO COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO WHICH WAS PUBLISHED TODAY BY THE LIBERAL NEWSPAPER EL TIEMPO. THE REPORT CONFIRMS THAT THERE IS A COLLABERATION BETWEEN DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND EXTREME RIGHT-WING GROUPS, AND THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN MERCENARIES IN COLOMBIA -- HIRED BY THE EXTREME RIGHT-WING DRUG-TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS. THE OFFICIAL ORGANIZATION ASSERTS THAT THE RECENTLY CREATED EXTREME RIGHTIST MOVEMENT OF NATIONAL RESTORATION "MUST BE IDENTIFIED AS THE CULMINATION OF A SYMBIOSIS BETWEEN DRUG TRAFFICKERS, SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS, GROUPS OF HIRED GUNMEN TRAINED BY FOREIGN MERCENARIES, AND AGRARIAN BUSINESSMEN WHO ARE TIRED OF THE GUERRILLA GROUPS' CONSTANT HARASSMENT." THE REPORT INDICATES THAT BRITISH AND ISRAELI MERCENARIES IDENTIFIED AS JOHN OWEN, DAVE TOMKINS, R. PAXTON, P. GLASGOW, A. DEWER, AND P. ATHERTON ENTERED COLOMBIA THROUGH ELDORADO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN JULY, BUT THE INFORMATION DOES NOT GIVE THEIR INDIVIDUAL NATIONALITIES. THE DAS ADDS THAT DEAN SHELLEY, PETER MCALEESE, ALEX LENOX, AND ANDRES GIBSON ENTERED THE COUNTRY IN PREVIOUSLY AND SETTLED IN THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS EXTREME RIGHT-WING GROUPS' MILITARY TRAINING CAMPS IN PUERTO BOYACA, MIDDLE MAGDALENA REGION , LA AZULITA , PUERTO LOPEZ , AND EL RECREO ON THE NORTHEASTERN FLATLANDS. RADIO STATIONS' REPORTS ADDED THAT COLONEL YAIR KLEIN HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AMONG THE ISRAELI MERCENARIES BY THE SECRET SERVICES OF HIS COUNTRY. KLEIN WAS COMMANDER OF A PARATROOPERS' UNIT IN 1983 AND APPARENTLY HAS A PRIVATE SECURITY AGENCY IN ISRAEL. ABRAHAM TZADAKA AND JACOBO BRINE WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED BY THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN. ON A NATIONAL NEWSCAST BROADCAST SEVERAL WEEKS AGO A VIDEO WHICH SHOWS THE ISRAELI MERCENARIES WEARING BLUE UNIFORMS DURING WAR MANEUVERS WITH THE DRUG-TRAFFICKERS FAR RIGHT-WING GROUPS' PRIVATE ARMY. THE SCENES WERE REPRODUCED BY THE NBC TELEVISION NETWORK IN THE UNITED STATES. PREVIOUS REPORTS FROM THE DAS, REVEALED IN COLOMBIA, INDICATE THAT THE COLOMBIANS TRAINED BY THE MERCENARIES INCLUDE PERSONS LINKED WITH THE SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS IN THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA REGION AND THE RECENTLY CREATED MORENA. THE FIRST PERSONS TO NOTIFY THE PROSECUTOR GENERAL OF THE NATION, THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY, ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN MERCENARIES AMONG THE DRUG-TRAFFICKERS FAR RIGHT-WING ARMED GROUPS WERE DESERTERS FROM THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS -- IDENTIFIED AS JESUS ALBERTO MOLINA URREA, RICAURTE DUQUE ARBOLEDA, AND VICTOR ARBOLEDA DUQUE. ACCORDING TO THE DESERTERS' DECLARATIONS, THE ISRAELI MERCENARIES CANNOT SPEAK SPANISH AND THEY FREQUENTLY MET WITH GONZALO DE JESUS PEREZ, HENRY PEREZ, AND MARCELO PEREZ. ACCORDING TO THE DAS REPORT REVEALED TODAY, "THE PEREZES," ARE IMPORTANT MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF MIDDLE MAGDALENA CATTLEMEN , THE SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS, AND MORENA; AND THE AUTHORITIES CHARGE THEM WITH THE MASS MURDERS OF PEASANTS IN URABA, LOCATED IN THE COUNTRY'S NORTHWESTERN AREA.
TST1-MUC3-0027	LA PAZ, 18 OCT 89 -- IT HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY REPORTED IN LA PAZ THAT A BOMB ATTACK OCCURRED EARLY THIS MORNING SOMEWHERE NEAR THE PLACE WHERE BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA AND PERUVIAN PRESIDENT GARCIA ARE TO MEET TODAY. NAVY LIEUTENANT JUSTO MARTINEZ, COMMANDER OF THE PORT OF THE BOLIVIAN CITY OF COPACABANA, REPORTED THAT A BOMB EXPLODED IN THE PERUVIAN TOWN OF YUNGUYO, WHICH IS LOCATED NEAR THE BORDER BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES, APPROXIMATELY 10 KM FROM COPACABANA. MARTINEZ ADDED THAT THE OFFICES OF THE DEPUTY MAYOR, A CIVILIAN OFFICE OCCUPIED BY THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNOR, WAS THE OBJECTIVE OF THE TERRORIST ATTACK. THE NAVY OFFICER TOLD LA PAZ RADIO PANAMERICANA THAT RECONNAISANCE PATROLS HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE BORDER WITH PERU AND OTHER "CRITICAL" POINTS OF COPACABANA BAY IN ORDER TO GUARD THE PRESIDENTIAL MEETING. IT IS IN FRONT OF THIS LAKE TITICACA BAY THAT PAZ ZAMORA AND GARCIA WILL MEET TODAY TO DISCUSS BILATERAL TOPICS AND MATTERS PERTAINING TO DRUG TRAFFICKING. BOLIVIA AND PERU GROW 90 PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S COCA LEAVES, WHICH ARE USED TO PRODUCE COCAINE.
TST1-MUC3-0028	PANAMA CITY , 10 MAY 90 -- ENDING OUR NEWSCAST, WE REPORT THAT AN ATTORNEY GENERAL OFFICE SPOKESMAN STATED TO A RPC TELEVISION REPORTER LATE THIS AFTERNOON THAT THERE ARE NO GROUNDS TO MANTAIN THE ARREST ORDERS AGAINST FORMER MAYOR GONZALO, AKA CHALO, GONZALEZ, WHO HAD TAKEN ASYLUM IN THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA CITY. THE SPOKESMAN ADDED THAT THE ARREST ORDER AGAINST THE FORMER OFFICER HAD BEEN REVOKED BECAUSE ONE OF THE PERSONS IMPLICATED IN THE CASE HAD WITHDRAWN HIS ACCUSATIONS AGAINST FORMER MAYOR GONZALO GONZALEZ. ACCORDING TO THIS REPORT, THE WITNESS SAID HE HAD ACCUSED GONZALEZ FOR PERSONAL REASONS. THEREFORE, GONZALEZ IS NO LONGER ACCUSED IN THE JUSTINES RODRIGUEZ CRIME.
TST1-MUC3-0029	BEIJING , 30 NOV 89 -- ON 30 NOVEMBER WHEN U.S. PRESIDENT BUSH SET FORTH TO MALTA TO MEET WITH SOVIET LEADER GORBACHEV, A REPORT FROM ANGOLA SAID THAT A CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY AIRPLANE ON A CLANDESTINE MISSION OF DELIVERING WEAPONS TO THE ANTIGOVERNMENT NATIONAL UNION FOR THE TOTAL INDEPENDENCE OF ANGOLA CRASHED IN SOUTHERN ANGOLA ON 27 NOVEMBER AND THAT THE FOUR AMERICANS ON THE PLANE WERE KILLED. TODAY BOTH THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT CONFIRMED THE CRASH, BUT THEY REFUSED TO COMMENT ON WHETHER THE AMERICANS WHO WERE KILLED WERE CIA OFFICIALS, OR ON THE NATURE OF THE PLANE'S MISSION. THIS IS IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE RESPONSE THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MADE A FEW DAYS AGO IN CONNECTION WITH A PLANE CRASH IN EL SALVADOR. AFTER A PLANE CARRYING WEAPONS TO THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS CRASHED ON 25 NOVEMBER, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE BAKER PROMPTLY INSTRUCTED THE UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE ON THAT SAME EVENING TO SUMMON THE SOVIET AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES TO PROTEST TO THE SOVIET UNION FOR UNDERMINING PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND "FAILING TO EXERCISE ITS INFLUENCE" TO STOP CUBA AND NICARAGUA FROM DELIVERING WEAPONS TO THE GUERRILLAS IN EL SALVADOR. IN THIS CONNECTION, A U.S. GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL POINTED OUT THAT PRESIDENT BUSH WOULD PRESENT THE CENTRAL AMERICA ISSUE AS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE WHILE DISCUSSING PROBLEMS OF REGIONAL CONFLICTS WITH SOVIET LEADERS DURING THEIR MEDITERRANEAN MEETING. SOME OFFICIALS EVEN SAID THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICA ISSUE IS THE "PRINCIPAL OBSTACLE" TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF U.S.-SOVIET RELATIONS, AND THAT ONLY WHEN THE USSR MAKES FURTHER CONCESSIONS ON THE CENTRAL AMERICA ISSUE WILL IT BE POSSIBLE FOR THE UNITED STATES TO PROVIDE ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO THE SOVIET UNION. IN A CEASEFIRE ACCORD SIGNED ON 24 JUNE THIS YEAR, UNITA AND THE ANGOLAN GOVERNMENT AGREED TO SEEK WAYS AND MEANS TO CONCLUDE THE CIVIL WAR THAT HAD GONE ON FOR 14 YEARS. HOWEVER, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT KEEPS SUPPLYING WEAPONS TO UNITA. ACCORDING TO U.S. NEWSPAPERS, EVER SINCE THE SOUTH AFRICAN AUTHORITIES STOPPED SUPPLYING WEAPONS TO UNITA LAST APRIL, THE UNITED STATES HAS BECOME UNITA'S MAIN WEAPON SUPPLIER. THE SECRET THAT THE UNITED STATES' MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO UNITA INCREASED FROM $15 MILLION TO $50 MILLION THIS YEAR WAS REVEALED AFTER THE CRASH OF THE CIA'S WEAPON CARRIER. NOW, EVEN THE U.S. PRESS HAS ASKED THIS QUESTION: COULD IT PREVENT PRESIDENT BUSH FROM PRESENTING HIS CRITICISM WHEN PROBLEMS OF REGIONAL CONFLICTS ARE DISCUSSED WHEN HE MEETS THE SOVIET LEADER? A U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL SAID: "NOT AT ALL," "WE WILL NOT PLACE ON A PAR." A STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ALSO SAID THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE "APPROPRIATE AND EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE" TO UNITA IN THE FUTURE.
TST1-MUC3-0030	NO CITY , 16 SEP 89 -- AS A LATIN AMERICAN PRESIDENT, I FEEL A LITTLE BIT UNCOMFORTABLE OVER THE STATEMENT THAT THE NORTH AMERICANS ARE VICTIMS OF THE DRUGS PRODUCED IN LATIN AMERICA AND THAT COLOMBIA, PERU, AND BOLIVIA ARE TO BLAME FOR PRODUCING THE DRUGS; LET'S CALL THOSE COUNTRIES TO TALK WITH THEM. THAT SEEMS TO ME A VERY ETHNOCENTRIC VISION; IT LOOKS AT THIS MATTER FROM ONLY ONE SIDE. OUR PEASANTS ARE POOR PEOPLE WHO PRODUCE WHATEVER IS MOST PROFITABLE, AND COCA CULTIVATION HAPPENS TO BE MOST PROFITABLE FOR THEM. THIS IS SO, SPEAKING COLDLY, HONESTLY, AND SINCERELY. AS PRESIDENT OF PERU I HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT MY PEOPLE, THE HUALLAGE REGION PEASANTS, CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS CRIMINALS OR AS PEOPLE WHO MUST BE JAILED FOR PRODUCING COCA LEAVES. WE HAVE EXCHANGED THESE VIEWS WITH PRESIDENT BARCO, AND WE REACHED THESE CONCLUSIONS. WE MUST ALSO NOTE THAT THIS MATTER HAS BEEN HANDLED WITH A GREAT DEAL OF PUBLICITY. AFTER THE DEATH OF CARLOS GALAN, A GREAT COLOMBIAN LEADER, THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED AN OFFENSIVE INTENDED TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE DRUG TRAFFICKING BANDS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS ASSASSINATION, AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THEN EXTENDED SOME ASSISTANCE. THIS ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN PRESENT TO THE WORLD AS THOUGH THE UNITED STATES HAD SENT AN ENORMOUS QUANTITY OF AIRCRAFT, HUNDREDS OF HELICOPTERS, AND THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO COLOMBIA. AS I WAS ABLE TO SEE IN BOGOTA, ONLY HELICOPTERS, SOME OF WHICH HAD BEEN PURCHASED EARLIER BY THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT, WERE SENT. I WAS ALSO INFORMED THAT SOME OF THOSE HELICOPTERS HAD BEEN USED PREVIOUSLY IN PERU. I HAVE SAID THAT, IF THERE IS THAT MUCH CONVICTION, I SUPPORT PRESIDENT BUSH FOR DEFENDING U.S. SOCIETY. IF HE HAS THAT MUCH CONVICTION, IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT LESS THAN ONE THOUSANDTH OF WHAT IS SPENT IN ARMS AND MILITARY EXPENDITURES SHOULD BE ALLOCATED TO REPLACE COCA PLANTATIONS AND TO IMPROVE THE GENERAL SITUATION IN LATIN AMERICA. WE HAVE TALKED WITH PRESIDENT BARCO, AND I WILL TALK WITH PRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA TO SEE HOW WE CAN EXCHANGE OPINIONS. THEN, AS PRESIDENT BUSH SAID, A MEETING OF PRESIDENTS WILL BE WELCOME. BUT THE MEETING SHOULD ALSO BE ATTENDED BY EUROPE, WHICH HAS A FUNDAMENTAL INTEREST IN THE FUTURE. WOULD THE IDEA BE TO HOLD A MEETING IN THE NEAR FUTURE OF PERU, COLOMBIA, AND BOLIVIA WITH PRESIDENT BUSH AND A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE EEC? YES, BECAUSE DRUG TRAFFICKING IS A GROWING PROBLEM. CARTELS HAVE SPROUTED IN COLOMBIA -- MONOPOLIES THAT TRY TO ELECT DEPUTIES AND SENATORS TO INFLUENCE THE GOVERNMENT. THOSE MONOPOLIES MIGHT EXTEND THEIR OPERATIONS TO OUR COUNTRIES IF WE DO NOT STOP THIS GROWING PROBLEM. THE SITUATION CAN BECOME WORSE IN BOLIVIA, WHERE IT WAS SAID THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAD AN INFLUENCE ON A DICTATORIAL MILITARY REGIME. IT IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF PROTECTING THE MORALITY OF HUMANITY; IT IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF DEFENDING THE UNITED STATES, WHICH HAS A PRIMARY ROLE IN WORLD LEADERSHIP; IT IS ESSENTIALLY A MATTER OF DEFENDING OUR DEMOCRACY -- THE LEGITIMACY AND CLEANLINESS OF OUR SOCIAL LIFE. I HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE A MEETING OF THE THREE PRESIDENTS FIRST, SO THAT WE CAN LET THE U.S. PRESIDENT KNOW OUR VIEWS ON THE OVERALL PROBLEM. WILL YOU PROPOSE THAT MEETING, MR PRESIDENT? I DON'T WANT TO ASSUME A LEADING ROLE. THE IDEA EMERGED IN A CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT BARCO, AND I WILL TALK LATER WITH PRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA. A MEETING BETWEEN YOU AND PRESIDENT BUSH LATE THIS MONTH HAS BEEN MENTIONED. IS THIS TRUE, MR PRESIDENT? NO, I BELIEVE THAT HAS BEEN MERE SPECULATION IN THE PRESS. FOR THE TIME BEING I HAVE DISCARDED THE IDEA OF MAKING ANOTHER TRIP ABROAD. I DO NOT SEE THE CONCRETE POSSIBILITY OF MEETING WITH PRESIDENT BUSH, ALTHOUGH I HOPE WE CAN MEET SOMETIME BEFORE 28 JULY 1990. CHANGING THE SUBJECT, MR PRESIDENT -- MUCH HAS BEEN SAID IN RECENT DAYS ABOUT THE POSSIBLE OR PROBABLE EXPULSION OF PERU FROM THE IMF. WHAT IS THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS, AND WHAT WOULD EXPULSION MEAN? WELL, FIRST, IT IS POLITICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR PERU TO BE EXPELLED FROM THE IMF. SECOND, THERE IS MISINFORMATION AND ALARMISM REGARDING THE MATTER. WHAT IS THE IMF? IT IS SOME SORT OF CREDITOR BANK CREATED IN 1946 THAT LENDS MONEY TO COUNTRIES WITH BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS PROBLEMS; THAT IS, WITH PROBLEMS WITH THEIR FOREIGN RESERVES LEVELS. WHEN A COUNTRY HAS NO RESERVES OR ONLY $100 MILLION IN RESERVES, IT CAN APPLY FOR A CREDIT FROM THE IMF TO PAY FOR IMPORTS OR OVERDUE DEBTS. THIS IS THE IMF, AN ORGANIZATION CREATED TO FACILITATE THE FLOW OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL RESOURCES. AN IMF CREDIT IS DEPENDENT ON SIGNING A LETTER OF INTENT OR AN ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM. ADJUSTMENT MEANS REDUCING THE COUNTRY'S INTERNAL CONSUMPTION SO AS TO SPARE THE COUNTRY'S RESERVES IN ORDER TO MEET DEBT OBLIGATIONS.
TST1-MUC3-0031	TEL AVIV , 12 NOV 89 -- THE REPORT THAT THE DAUGHTER OF ISRAEL'S AMBASSADOR TO EL SALVADOR WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED BY GUNFIRE SHOTS IS ABSOLUTELY UNFOUNDED. THE AMBASSADOR'S DAUGHTER, WITH HER FAMILY, IS IN ISRAEL. SHE IS SAFE AND SOUND. THE ERRONEOUS REPORT ON HER INJURY WAS CARRIED BY THE AFP NEWS AGENCY. TO REPEAT, THE REPORT HAS NO BASIS WHATSOEVER. ON THE ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO EL SALVADOR'S DESCRIPTION OF EVENTS IN SAN SALVADOR OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS
TST1-MUC3-0032	BUENOS AIRES, 18 MAY 90 -- NEXT JUNE AN ENTIRE U.S. ARMY COMPANY WILL CARRY OUT JOINT MANEUVERS WITH ARGENTINE TROOPS IN A PROVINCE OF THE LITTORAL REGION. THE MANEUVERS, DESIGNED TO TEACH THE ARGENTINE OFFICERS THE LATEST TECHNIQUES AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, FALL WITHIN THE COMPREHENSIVE MILITARY EXCHANGE PLAN. GENERAL MAXWELL THURMAN'S VISIT IS ALSO PART OF THE AFOREMENTIONED PLAN. ACCORDING TO RELIABLE SOURCES, THE RECENT VISIT FROM THE UNITED STATES OF 10 LIEUTENANT COLONELS, THREE COLONELS, AND EIGHT CIVILIAN EXPERTS IN DEFENSE STRATEGY, REPRESENT AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THE RENEWED U.S.-ARGENTINE MILITARY RELATIONSHIP. THE SAME SOURCES HAVE STATED THAT THE GRADUAL AND RESTRICTED PARTICIPATION OF THE ARMY IN MANEUVERS DESIGNED TO PRACTICE FIGHTING AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED BY THE DEFENSE MINISTRY AND EVEN BY THE PRESIDENT. THE MILITARY GROUP THAT ARRIVED IN ARGENTINA ON 6 MAY CARRIED OUT WAR GAMES AT THE WAR SCHOOL AND THE CAMPO DE MAYO MILITARY SCHOOL AND, LATER ON, CARRIED OUT FIELD MANEUVERS. OTHER FORCES PARTICIPATED IN THE THREE-DAY MANEUVERS THAT WERE CARRIED OUT ON AN ISLAND IN THE RIVER PLATE DELTA. ACCORDING TO A WITNESS, THE MANEUVERS CONSISTED OF "RAIDS" INCLUDING "SURPRISE" SITUATIONS THAT FORCED THE U.S. TROOPS TO ENDURE BAD WEATHER AND BAD TERRAIN. ACCORDING TO THE FINAL EVALUATION, THE MANEUVERS WERE REGARDED AS "SATISFACTORY AND SUCCESSFUL". ACCORDING TO THE PROGRAM, A COMPLETE U.S. COMPANY THAT WILL TRAIN WITH ARGENTINE TROOPS IN A PROVINCE OF THE LITTORAL REGION IS SCHEDULED TO ARRIVE IN JUNE. FOREIGN MINISTRY SOURCES CONFIRMED THE EXISTENCE OF EXCHANGE PLANS BUT STATED THAT GENERAL THURMAN HAD PROPOSED TO THE CHIEFS OF STAFF THE POSSIBILITY OF CARRYING OUT JOINT MANEUVERS TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING DURING A LUNCHEON. THE SOURCES STATED THAT THE CHIEFS OF STAFF HAVE MADE SOME OBJECTIONS TO THE PROPOSAL AND DID NOT REACH ANY AGREEMENT. HOWEVER, SOURCES THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE RECENT MANEUVERS ON THE ISLAND HAD A DIFFERENT OPINION AND RATIFIED THAT ANOTHER MANEUVER WOULD BE HELD IN A PROVINCE OF THE LITTORAL IN JUNE. ANYHOW, THE STATEMENT OF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN FALLS WITHIN THE DIPLOMATIC POLICY THAT MAY PARTLY DIFFER WITH THE MILITARY AND DEFENSE POLICIES, AS WAS POINTED OUT BY A SECTOR OF THE MEDIA YESTERDAY. MOREOVER, GENERAL THURMAN WILL REMAIN IN SAN CARLOS DE BARILOCHE UNTIL SATURDAY, 19 MAY, AND THAT SAME DAY WILL FLY TO THE IGUAZU FALLS FROM WHERE HE WILL RETURN TO HIS MILITARY BASE IN PANAMA. THE ONLY PURPOSE OF GENERAL THURMAN'S VISIT WAS TO OFFER THE DEFENSE MINISTRY ALL THE TECHNOLOGY, KNOW HOW, AND WEAPONS FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING WHICH, IN MANY CASES TURNS INTO NARCOTERRORISM, IN OTHER WORDS, THE USE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING TO FINANCE THE PURCHASE OF WEAPONS AND TERRORIST ACTIONS. THURMAN'S VISIT, WHICH TOOK THE UNITED STATES A WHOLE YEAR TO ARRANGE, WAS PREVIOUSLY APPROVED BY THE U.S. SENATE. WITHIN THE SAME FRAMEWORK, THE BOLIVIAN POLICE HAVE JUST RECEIVED WEAPONS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT AMOUNTING TO $50 MILLION, WHICH IS ENOUGH TO EQUIP TWO COMPLETE BATTALIONS IN CHARGE OF FIGHTING DRUG TRAFFICKERS. THEREFORE, THE ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING LAUNCHED BY THE UNITED STATES IS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY OF THE SOUTHERN CONE OF WHICH ARGENTINA -- ACCORDING TO EXPERTS -- MUST PARTICIPATE OUT OF FEAR OF A GROWING ISOLATION. IT IS QUITE LIKELY THAT THE RESTRICTED AND GRADUAL -- BY NO MEANS MASSIVE -- PARTICIPATION OF THE ARMY AND PROBABLY THE NAVY IN MANEUVERS FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING MAY BE THE KEY THAT WILL FINALLY ALLOW THE ARMED FORCES TO ACQUIRE THE WAR MATERIEL, SPARE PARTS AND OTHER ELEMENTS IT NEEDS. THE ANALYSTS HAVE RECALLED THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S DETERMINATION TO FIGHT CORRUPTION -- A PROBLEM THAT ALSO WORRIES PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM AND VICE PRESIDENT EDUARDO DUHALDE -- FALLS WITHIN THE SAME FRAMEWORK BECAUSE, IN THE EXPERTS' OPINION, IT IS THE EQUIVALENT TO DRUG TRAFFICKING. HIGHLY RELIABLE SOURCES HAVE RECALLED THAT 30 DAYS AGO PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH SENT PRESIDENT MENEM TWO VOLUMES OF A U.S. EDITION ON TECHNIQUES TO FIGHT CORRUPTION.
TST1-MUC3-0033	BOGOTA, 9 SEP 89 -- THE PEACE PROCESS WITH M-19 THAT WAS INTERRUPTED DUE TO THE MURDER OF TWO MEMBERS OF THAT SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION -- NOW OBSERVING A TRUCE -- WAS RESTORED FOLLOWING A VISIT BY PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER RAFAEL PARDO TO THE M-19 CAMP IN SANTO DOMINGO, CAUCA DEPARTMENT. OUR CORRESPONDENT MARIA ALEJANDRA GONZALEZ WAS THERE. THE PEACE PROCESS BETWEEN M-19 AND THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WAS SERIOUSLY JEOPARDIZED THIS WEEK DUE TO THE MURDER OF TWO MEMBERS OF THAT GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION, WHICH OCCURRED AT THE BORDER BETWEEN CAUCA AND VALLE DEL CAUCA DEPARTMENTS. CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN OVER THE SITUATION. WE ARE LIVING A SLOW MOTION PEACE PROCESS. WE NEED A PEACE PROCESS THROUGH WHICH COLOMBIANS CAN FEEL THAT PEACE HAS ARRIVED, INSTEAD OF A PROCESS THAT IS SIMPLY A PERMANENT AND ENDLESS ACCOUNT OF PEACE TRAGEDIES. OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS, PRESIDENTIAL PEACE ADVISER RAFAEL PARDO AND DEPUTY GOVERNMENT MINISTER JOSE NOE RIOS MET WITH MEMBERS OF THE M-19 COMMAND. THE PARTICIPANTS REAFFIRMED THEIR DETERMINATION TO CONTINUE WITH THE PEACE EFFORTS. A FORUM FOR LIFE, DEMOCRACY, AND PROGRESS WILL BE HELD IN SANTO DOMINGO THIS WEEKEND, WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF POLITICAL LEADERS AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS. THE EVENT WILL INCLUDE SPORTS AND CULTURAL ACTIVITIES. COMMISSIONS WILL WORK ON DEVELOPMENT PLANS. AT LEAST 2,000 PEOPLE ARE EXPECTED THIS WEEKEND AT THE PEACE CAMP.
TST1-MUC3-0034	SAN SALVADOR, 23 NOV 89 -- TODAY SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI REJECTED A REBEL PROPOSAL TO IMMEDIATELY NEGOTIATE A CEASE-FIRE WITH THE ARMY UNDER OAS AND UNITED NATIONS SUPERVISION; HOWEVER, HE DID EXPRESS HIS INTENTION TO SEEK A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE ARMED CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY. THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE ATTACKED THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR WITH MACHINEGUN FIRE AND ROCKETS JUST AS PRESIDENT CRISTIANI REJECTED THE DIALOGUE PROPOSAL MADE BY THE GUERRILLAS ON 22 NOVEMBER. FOUR "PUSH AND PULL" PLANES AND TWO HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS OPENED FIRE ON ALLEGED FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT COLUMNS IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR. "THEIR PROPOSAL IS NOT SERIOUS, ARE ONCE AGAIN SAYING THAT THERE ARE TWO ARMED FORCES. IN EL SALVADOR THERE IS ONLY ONE ARMED FORCE," CRISTIANI SAID. HE ADDED THAT A POLITICAL SOLUTION ENTAILS THAT THE GUERRILLAS END THE VIOLENCE. THE PRESIDENT, ACCOMPANIED BY COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE ARMED FORCES, SAID IN A NEWS CONFERENCE THAT THE FMLN PROPOSAL "IS NOT VERY SERIOUS" BECAUSE "IT IS NOT AIMED AT THE GOVERNMENT BUT AT THE ARMY, WHICH IS PART OF THE GOVERNMENT," HE SAID. ACCORDING TO CRISTIANI, THE NEW FMLN PROPOSAL IS "PROPAGANDIST" AND IS ONLY MEANT TO GAIN SOME TIME IN VIEW OF THE "MILITARY DEFEAT SUFFERED IN THE LAST FEW DAYS." CRISTIANI SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO SEEK A RATIONAL SOLUTION TO THE MILITARY CONFLICT IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT HE CATEGORICALLY EMPHASIZED THAT THIS MEANS THAT THE GUERRILLAS MUST LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND JOIN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. "WE WILL NOT ALLOW THE GUERRILLAS TO REGROUP AND BEGIN ATTACKING AGAIN. IF THEY WANT TO HOLD A DIALOGUE, THEY SHOULD LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND PEACEFULLY JOIN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS," CRISTIANI SAID. THE PRESIDENT WARNED THAT "THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE WILLING TO FIGHT MILITARILY. IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE FMLN CONTINUES TO BEHAVE THIS WAY, NOT LISTENING TO REASON, AND NOT ENDING THIS MADNESS," THE RIGHTIST PRESIDENT SAID. THE NEWS CONFERENCE, HELD WITH SOME 50 JOURNALISTS, WAS ABRUPTLY INTERRUPTED BY THE HEAVY BOMBINGS CARRIED OUT BY THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE AGAINST ALLEGED GUERRILLA COLUMNS. FOLLOWING THE FIRST BOMBINGS, WHICH ROCKED THE MILITARY OFFICES WHERE THE NEWS CONFERENCE WAS BEING HELD, CRISTIANI AND PONCE RESUMED CONTROL OF THE CONFERENCE AND EXPLAINED THAT THE ATTACK WAS THE RESULT OF AN OPERATION IN PURSUIT OF THE "GUERRILLAS FLEEING IN DISARRAY." THE AIR FORCE BOMBING BEGAN SHORTLY BEFORE THE CURFEW, WHICH BEGAN AT 1800 UNTIL 0600 IN THE MORNING , JUST WHEN THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS WERE RETURNING HOME. THE HEAVY EXPLOSIONS CAUSED ALARM AMONG THE POPULATION IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR AND IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN HURT. ACCORDING TO CRISTIANI, THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE "HAS BEEN A FAILURE" NOT ONLY MILITARILY, BUT POLITICALLY AS WELL BECAUSE THEY WERE UNABLE TO INCITE THE PEOPLE TO REBELLION, AS THEY PLANNED. THE PROPOSAL SIGNED BY THE TOP FIVE FMLN COMMANDERS AND READ ON THE OFFICIAL REBEL STATION, CLANDESTINE RADIO VENCEREMOS, HAS BEEN RELEASED IN THE FRAMEWORK OF A REBEL MILITARY OFFENSIVE, WHICH BEGAN 12 DAYS AGO AND WHICH HAS LEFT MORE THAN 1,000 PEOPLE DEAD, HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WOUNDED, AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HOMELESS.
TST1-MUC3-0035	CLANDESTINE, 26 MAY 89 -- PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION. RADIO VENCEREMOS WILL NOW GIVE A PRELIMINARY BULLETIN ON VARIOUS ACTIONS THAT TOOK PLACE THURSDAY NIGHT IN SAN SALVADOR. EVERYONE AGAINST ARENA -- WE WILL WIN! THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT REPORTS THAT URBAN COMMANDO UNITS STAGED SIMULTANEOUS ATTACKS ON THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS AND THE NATIONAL POLICE HEADQUARTERS AT 1830 ON THURSDAY, 25 MAY, IN THE ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD. FURTHERMORE, ARMED UNITS DISTRIBUTED PROPAGANDA IN NEARBY AREAS. OUR UNITS ALSO SABOTAGED THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM. WE REPORT THAT ARMED FORCES TROOPS REACTED BY SHOOTING INDISCRIMINATELY, SURROUNDING THE AREAS OF THE ATTACKS, AND CONDUCTING SEARCHES AND ARRESTS. THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN SURROUNDED. TROOPS HAVE ENTERED THE UNIVERSITY AND OPENED FIRE INDISCRIMINATELY INSIDE UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS. IN FACE OF THE TERRORISM WAGED BY ARENA AND THE ARMED FORCES, EVERYONE SHOULD PREPARE TO FIGHT. EVERYONE AGAINST ARENA -- WE WILL WIN!
TST1-MUC3-0036	TEGUCIGALPA, 13 JUL 89 -- ATTENTION: A GROUP OF NINE U.S. SOLDIERS STATIONED AT THE PALMEROLA BASE WHO WERE VISITING THE CITY OF LA CEIBA WERE ATTACKED AT 0030 TODAY. THE NINE U.S. SOLDIERS FROM PALMEROLA BASE WERE ON A RECREATIONAL VISIT AND WERE WOUNDED WHEN A HOMEMADE BOMB EXPLODED. SEVEN OF THE NINE SOLDIERS WERE WOUNDED, THREE OF THE SOLDIERS ARE IN GRAVE CONDITION. THE AUTHORITIES REPORTED THAT THEY HAVE ONLY ARRESTED TWO SUSPECTS IN THIS ATTACK AGAINST U.S. SOLDIERS, WHICH TOOK PLACE AT 0030.
TST1-MUC3-0037	SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 -- TWO U.S. CITIZENS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE LAST FEW HOURS, VICTIMS OF THE SALVADORAN WAR THAT THEIR OWN COUNTRY SUPPORTS AND FINANCES, LABOR AND POLITICAL LEADERS HAVE TOLD DPA. THE U.S. EMBASSY HAS NOT OFFICIALLY REPORTED THIS TRAGEDY, BUT IT WAS LEARNED FROM JUDICIAL SOURCES THAT ERIKA SULLIVAN AND CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON, A 26-YEAR-OLD TEACHER AT THE AMERICAN SCHOOL HAVE BEEN KILLED. ACCORDING TO THE RED CROSS, MISS SULLIVAN WAS DRIVING HER VEHICLE WHEN SHE WAS CAUGHT IN THE HEAVY SHOOTING THAT TOOK PLACE ON 11 NOVEMBER. ANDERSON LIVED NEAR PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S MANSION, AND WHEN HE HEARD THE EXPLOSIONS DURING THE ATTACK ON THE PRESIDENT'S HOME, HE WENT OUTSIDE TO PUT HIS CAR IN THE GARAGE. UNFORTUNATELY, AT THAT MOMENT, A GRENADE HIT HIS CAR. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THEIR BODIES WILL BE SENT TO THE UNITED STATES TODAY. THE DAUGHTER OF THE EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR, NADINE ELKASHES, WAS ALMOST KILLED ALSO.
TST1-MUC3-0038	MANAGUA , 26 AUG 89 -- TEOTECACINTE -- MORE THAN 400 COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES HAVE DESERTED THE CAMPS IN YAMALES AND ARE ROAMING THE AREAS OF TROJES, CIFUENTES, JAMASTRAN, EL PARAISO, DANLI, SAN MARCOS, AND TEGUCIGALPA, DESPERATELY TRYING TO SLIP INTO THE REFUGEE GROUPS TO BE REPATRIATED -- HAD TIES WITH THE CONTRAS FOR 7 YEARS AND WAS FINALLY REPATRIATED ON WEDNESDAY 23 AUGUST. AN INTERIOR MINISTRY SOURCE CONFIRMED TO BARRICADA THAT A CONTRA DESERTER PASSING HIMSELF OFF AS A REFUGEE ENTERED THE COUNTRY WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE REPATRIATED BY THE ACNUR. THE TELA AGREEMENTS HAVE CAUSED HAVOC NOT ONLY IN THE CONTRA RANKS, BUT ALSO IN THE REFUGEE CAMPS. THEIR DESPERATION TO RETURN TO NICARAGUA IS SUCH THAT MORE THAN 160 PERSONS TRIED TO ENTER THE COUNTRY ON 24 AUGUST THROUGH THE MURUPUCHI AND CERRO LA PIEDRA BORDER POSTS, BUT THE HONDURAN ARMY STOPPED THEM BECAUSE THEY LACKED THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTS. ACCORDING TO JOSE TOMAS OSORIO, THE REFUGEES TRUST THE GUARANTEES OFFERED BY THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT. THIS WAS ASCERTAINED BY SEVERAL JOURNALISTS AT THE CERRO LA PIEDRA BORDER POST. SEVERAL PERSONS QUICKLY GOT OUT OF A VEHICLE BUT THE HONDURAN TROOPS' PRESENCE FRUSTRATED THEIR PLAN. THE RED CROSS' BRANCH IN JALAPA HAS INSTALLED A RECEPTION POST IN CERRO LA PIEDRA, BEHIND THE TROJES CEMETERY, TO AVOID TRAGEDIES LIKE THE ONE WHICH OCCURRED LAST WEEK, WHEN A YOUTH FELL INTO A MINED FIELD. THE NICARAGUANS WILL NOW BE ABLE TO CROSS THE BORDER, IF THE HONDURAN ARMY ALLOWS THEM, WITHOUT FACING ANY DANGER. RED CROSS PRESIDENT DENIS GUZMAN, WHO IS ALSO PRESIDENT OF THE PEACE COMMISSION, SPOKE ON 25 AUGUST WITH THE PERSON COMMANDING THE HONDURAN BORDER POST. HE SAID THAT THE RED CROSS WAS WILLING TO ACCEPT ALL THOSE WHO WANT TO RETURN TO NICARAGUA. THE HONDURAN OFFICER SAID: "WE HAVE NO INFORMATION BUT, IF MY COMMANDER AUTHORIZES IT, WE WILL NOT OBJECT AND WILL LET THEM PASS. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT LET ANYONE CROSS THROUGH HERE FOR THE TIME BEING." SEVERAL REPATRIATED PERSONS RETURNING ON 23 AUGUST THROUGH LAS MANOS CONFIRMED THE PROBLEMS OF THE REFUGEES AT THE CAMPS: "THERE IS NO FREEDOM TO WORK, THE FOOD IS RATIONED, THE PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS HUNGRY, AND WE LIVED LIKE ANIMALS IN A CORRAL," IT WAS STATED BY ERNESTINA UMANZOR, WHO WAS KIDNAPPED AT THE CIFUENTES BORDER REGION AND LATER WAS REPATRIATED. REFERRING TO THE CONTRAS, THE NICARAGUANS LIVING IN HONDURAN TERRITORY SAID THAT THE FORMER "ARE OUTSIDE THE LAW; THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO; THEY MUST PUT DOWN THEIR WEAPONS; THEY MUST BE DEMOBILIZED; THEY HAVE NO BUSINESS GOING TO THIRD COUNTRIES; THEY MUST RETURN TO THEIR HOMELAND," IT WAS ASSERTED BY DOMINGO OROZCO. THE REPATRIATED PEOPLE WHO ARRIVED AT TEOTECACINTE WERE WELCOMED BY LOCAL PEOPLE, WHO WERE SATISFIED WITH THEIR RETURN AND SAID THEY WOULD SUPPORT THOSE WHO WISH TO TILL IDLE AND ABANDONED LANDS.
TST1-MUC3-0039	SANTIAGO, 29 MAR 89 -- THE INVESTIGATIVE POLICE HAVE ADMITTED THAT THE INDIVIDUALS THAT FIRED THEIR GUNS DURING A DEMONSTRATION OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AT BERNARDO O'HIGGINS AVENUE YESTERDAY ARE MEMBERS OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. THE CIVILIAN POLICE PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICE RELEASED THE FOLLOWING COMMUNIQUE: REGARDING THE PICTURE THAT APPEARS IN THE MORNING NEWSPAPERS LA EPOCA AND FORTIN MAPOCHO SHOWING CIVILIANS TRYING TO CONTROL THE DISORDERS PROVOKED BY YOUNG INDIVIDUALS AT BERNARDO O'HIGGINS AVENUE NEAR SAN IGNACIO AND NATANIEL STREETS, THE INVESTIGATIVE POLICE PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICE STATES THE FOLLOWING: 1. THE CAR THAT APPEARS IN THE PICTURES OF BOTH NEWSPAPERS BELONGS TO THE INVESTIGATIVE POLICE. THE CAR WAS ON PATROL CARRYING OUT SURVEILLANCE FOR POSSIBLE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. 2. THE BEHAVIOR OF THE AGENTS IN THE POLICE CAR IS NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NORMS OF CONDUCT ESTABLISHED BY THE INSTITUTION FOR SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES. THE INSTITUTION WILL THEREFORE DISCIPLINE THE AGENTS INVOLVED. 3. HOWEVER, THE INVESTIGATIVE POLICE WARN THAT ACCORDING TO LAW 2460, ARTICLE 5, ITS DUTY IS TO MAINTAIN PUBLIC ORDER AND COMBAT ALL CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES. 4. THE POPULATION MUST REST ASSURED THAT THE INSTITUTION WILL FULFILL ITS DUTY TO MAINTAIN ORDER WHILE MAINTAINING THE APPROPRIATE STANDARD OF CONDUCT WITHIN THE DETECTIVE DEPARTMENT. SIGNED: JUAN DIAZ JARA, CHIEF PREFECT OF THE CIVILIAN POLICE PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICE. SEVERAL SHOTS WERE HEARD FOLLOWING THE INCIDENTS YESTERDAY AT THE CENTRAL WALKWAY OF BERNARDO O'HIGGINS AVENUE DURING A DEMONSTRATION STAGED BY STUDENTS FROM THE APPLICATIONS SCHOOL. THE STUDENTS WERE MARCHING TO HONOR THE TWO VERGARA TOLEDO BROTHERS WHO WERE KILLED 4 YEARS AGO DURING AN APPARENT CONFRONTATION AT VILLA FRANCIA. AROUND 1400 YESTERDAY, SOME 100 STUDENTS FROM THE APPLICATIONS SCHOOL BUILT A ROADBLOCK AND MARCHED THROUGH THE CENTRAL WALKWAY OF O'HIGGINGS AVENUE. WHEN THE DEMONSTRATORS PASSED THE BRAZILIAN EMBASSY, A GUARD CAME OUT AND POINTED A GUN AT THEM. THE STUDENTS THEN PICKED UP STONES AND FORCES THE GUARD TO WITHDRAW. LATER, TWO INDIVIDUALS IN A CHEVROLET OPALA AUTOMOBILE POINTED AK RIFLES AT THE STUDENTS, FIRED SOME SHOTS, AND QUICKLY DROVE AWAY. FINALLY A DETACHMENT OF CARABINEROS ARRIVED AT THE SCENE, ARRESTED SEVERAL STUDENTS, AND BROKE UP THE DEMONSTRATION.
TST1-MUC3-0040	BOGOTA, 4 JAN 90 -- TODAY "THE EXTRADITABLES," AN ORGANIZATION CONSIDERED TO BE THE ARMED SECTOR OF THE "MEDELLIN CARTEL," ORDERED "ITS LEADERS" IN LOW-INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS "TO TAKE HOSTAGES FROM TRADITIONAL BOURGEOISIE SECTORS TO FINANCE THE WAR" IT IS WAGING WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO. "THE EXTRADITABLES" SENT A 7-POINT COMMUNIQUE TO SEVERAL MEDIA SOURCES IN MEDELLIN, CALLING ON THEIR MEN TO DEMAND LARGE SUMS OF MONEY FROM THE RELATIVES OF THE PERSONS THEY KIDNAP. THEY ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE PERSONS WHO ARE GOING TO CARRY OUT THE ABDUCTIONS SHOULD SELECT THE VICTIMS FROM AMONG POLITICIANS AND MEMBERS OF THE COLOMBIAN BOURGEOISIE "WHO HAVE NEVER DISTINGUISHED THEMSELVES BY MAKING SOCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMMUNITY." THEY ADD THAT "50 PERCENT OF THE FUNDS OBTAINED FROM SUCH MILITARY ACTIONS ARE TO BE USED TO FINANCE THE WAR AGAINST THE POLITICAL OLIGARCHY AND THE OTHER 50 PERCENT TO RECONSTRUCT LOW-INCOME HOUSING FOR THE HOMELESS." ANOTHER POINT NOTES THAT "THIS MEASURE HAS BEEN TAKEN AS A RESPONSE TO THE OFFICIAL PERSECUTION AGAINST OUR FAMILIES AND ORGANIZATIONS," AND IT CONCLUDES BY STATING THAT "WE ARE WILLING TO HOLD A DIALOGUE AS THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE ARE REQUESTING AND DESIRE." ON 24 AUGUST 1989, "THE EXTRADITABLES" ANNOUNCED A COUNTEROFFENSIVE IN RESPONSE TO THE OFFICIAL ACTIONS OF PRESIDENT BARCO'S GOVERNMENT. THE GOVERNMENT INITIATED THE ATTACK ON THE DRUG-TRAFFICKING MAFIAS AFTER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LUIS CARLOS GALAN WAS KILLED ON 18 AUGUST. SINCE THEN, DRUG TRAFFICKERS BEGAN A SERIES OF ATTACKS WITH EXPLOSIVES AND CAR BOMBS MAINLY AGAINST BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, POLITICAL HEADQUARTERS, AND NEWSPAPERS. ON 2 SEPTEMBER, A CAR BOMB DESTROYED THE INSTALLATIONS OF "EL ESPECTADOR" NEWSPAPER IN BOGOTA AND 5 WEEKS LATER ANOTHER CAR BOMB CAUSED SIMILAR DAMAGE TO THE "VANGUARDIA LIBERAL" NEWSPAPER IN BUCARAMANGA, IN NORTHEASTERN COLOMBIA. SEVERAL SECURITY FORCES HEADQUARTERS HAVE ALSO BEEN HIT BY THESE ATTACKS AND AN AVIANCA AIRLINES PLANE BLEW UP IN MIDAIR ON 27 NOVEMBER KILLING ALL 107 PASSENGERS AND CREW. A WEEK LATER, A BUS BOMB BLEW UP IN THE VICINITY OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY , IN THE CENTER OF BOGOTA, AND DESTROYED THE 11-FLOOR BUILDING, LEAVING 67 DEAD AND APPROXIMATELY 1,000 WOUNDED.
TST1-MUC3-0041	CLANDESTINE, 13 NOV 89 -- ATTENTION, WE HAVE A LAST MINUTE REPORT. RADIO VENCEREMOS REPORTS TO OUR PEOPLE ON THE FIGHTING THAT IS UNDER WAY IN SAN SALVADOR. WE ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU MILITARY INFORMATION FROM THE METROPOLITAN WAR FRONT, AS FOLLOWS: THERE HAS BEEN FIGHTING AGAINST ATLACATL BATTALION ARMORED VEHICLES IN CUSCATANCINGO. AT 0700, THERE WAS AN EXTENSIVE AMBUSH IN WHICH SIX ARMORED VEHICLES WERE DESTROYED. THE AMBUSH WAS STAGED AGAINST ATLACATL BATTALION TROOPS IN CUSCATANCINGO WHO WERE ON THEIR WAY TO REINFORCE ENEMY POSITIONS UNDER ATTACK IN VARIOUS POINTS OF THE CAPITAL. OUR FORCES USED ROCKET LAUNCHERS AND SMALL ARMS FIRE, AS WELL AS EXPLOSIVES, TO AMBUSH THIS CONVOY, DESTROYING SIX ARMORED VEHICLES. IN ADDITION, FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FIGHTERS ATTACKED BELLOSO BATTALION TROOPS IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE. THE BELLOSO BATTALION CALLED FOR AIR SUPPORT, WHICH IT RECEIVED, BUT THIS HAS RESULTED IN MORE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES BECAUSE THE HELICOPTERS USED HAVE BEEN BOMBING AND STRAFING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN THE AYUTUXTEPEQUE AREA. THE DESPERATE AIR SUPPORT HAS RESULTED IN MORE CIVILIAN VICTIMS. MEANWHILE, FMLN FORCES BEGAN ATTACKING ENEMY POSITIONS IN LOS SANTOS, BOSQUES DEL RIO, AND UNICENTRO, IN SOYAPANGO. IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT BARRICADES ARE CONSTANTLY BEING BUILT IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS OF SAN SALVADOR'S NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN SECTORS. THESE ARE BARRICADES BUILT BY YOUTHS, STUDENTS, WORKERS, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN WHO HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS TO HELP WITH FOOD AND INFORMATION AND WHO, WITH THEIR OWN HANDS, ARE BUILDING BARRICADES AND ANSWERING THE CALL OF THE VANGUARD: THE FMLN. WE ARE RECEIVING A REPORT WHICH INDICATES THAT THE FIGHTING WHICH HAD DECREASED IN THE UNIVERSITY AREA RESUMED AT 0600 THIS MORNING.
TST1-MUC3-0042	TEGUCIGALPA, 20 DEC 89 -- FOLLOWING THE U.S. INVASION OF GRENADA ISLAND, THE WORLD DISCARDED ANY FURTHER POSSIBILITY OF A U.S. ARMED OPERATION AGAINST ANOTHER NATION OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT, DESPITE THE DETERIORATION OF ITS RELATIONS WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS AND PROVOCATIONS AGAINST THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THE U.S. WOULD CONFINE ITS PARTICIPATION TO SUPPORTING AND SPONSORING MOVEMENTS AIMED AT OUSTING GOVERNMENTS OR, AS IN THE CASE OF NICARAGUA, OF SUPPORTING REBEL FORCES TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS SET BY THE WHITE HOUSE. THE EVENTS THAT OCCURRED EARLY THIS MORNING IN PANAMA HAVE SURPRISED THE WORLD BECAUSE, DESPITE GENERAL MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA'S CHALLENGING ATTITUDE, NO ONE THOUGHT THE U.S. WOULD INVADE PANAMA. NORIEGA WAS CERTAIN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT DO SO, AND SUPPOSED THAT U.S. ATTITUDES AGAINST HIM WOULD CONSIST OF SPONSORING REBELLION, SUCH AS THE RECENT 3-OCTOBER ATTEMPT, WHEN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ENCOURAGED MEMBERS OF THE PANAMANIAN DEFENSE FORCES TO REBEL AGAINST THEIR COMMANDER IN CHIEF. NORIEGA NEVER THOUGHT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WOULD EVER CONDUCT A MILITARY OPERATION AGAINST PANAMA, ALTHOUGH THERE WERE U.S. TROOPS BASED ON THE CANAL ZONE. HE CONTINUED UNDER THIS IMPRESSION BECAUSE NEVER BEFORE HAD THESE TROOPS CHANGED FROM THEIR ROLE OF SURVEILLANCE, NOT EVEN WHEN WASHINGTON PROMOTED THE REBELLION OF SOME YOUNG OFFICERS OF THE PANAMANIAN FORCES. THIS EXCESSIVE SECURITY DISTRACTED NORIEGA AND ENCOURAGED HIM TO CHALLENGE THE U.S. POLICIES. NORIEGA DID NOT BELIEVE THE U.S. THREATS AND HE ADOPTED AN OMNIPOTENT STANCE, LIKE HIS RECENT DECISION TO APPOINT HIMSELF THE SUPREME LEADER OF PANAMA. NORIEGA BELIEVED THAT THE UNITED STATES WOULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT SUBVERSION IN HIS COUNTRY, AND THAT THE U.S. DECISION TO SUPPORT THE OPPOSITION CURRENTLY IN EXILE WOULD PRODUCE MOVEMENTS AGAINST HIS REGIME, OR THAT A COMMANDO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO KIDNAP HIM. AS A RESULT OF THIS BELIEF, HE INCREASED THE STRENGTH OF THE MILITARY FORCES AND EQUIPPED MANY CIVILIANS WHO SUPPORTED HIM WITH WEAPONS TO BE READY TO DISMANTLE MOVEMENTS THAT TRIED TO DESTABILIZE HIS GOVERNMENT. AS THE CLOCKS STRUCK MIDNIGHT IN PANAMA, THE U.S. FORCES BEGAN AN OPERATION AGAINST THE PANAMANIAN DEFENSE FORCE BARRACKS. THE TROOPS ALREADY BASED IN PANAMA, AND THOSE FLOWN IN FROM BASES IN CALIFORNIA AND IN OTHER CITIES NEAR PANAMA, STARTED A MASSIVE ATTACK TO OUST GEN NORIEGA. THE INVASION, WHICH SEEMED POSSIBLE TO SOME AND TO OTHERS , WERE MAINLY CONDUCTED TO PUNISH SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN DECLARED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT LATIN AMERICAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS BY THE U.S. COURTS. EARLY THIS MORNING, SOURCES CLOSE TO THE WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCED THAT THE OPERATION WAS AIMED AT CAPTURING NORIEGA AND TAKING HIM TO THE UNITED STATES TO BE TRIED FOR THE CRIMES ATTRIBUTED TO HIM BY THE U.S. COURTS, AT ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH THE TREATIES ON THE PANAMA CANAL, AND AT RESTORING DEMOCRACY IN THE COUNTRY FOLLOWING THE FARCICAL MAY-L989 ELECTIONS. THESE ARE THE REASONS FOR THE U.S. ARMED INTERVENTION IN PANAMA, WHICH IS FILLING THE WORLD WITH TREPIDATION DUE TO THE DANGER HOVERING OVER THE CONTINENT AND THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT BUSH'S DECISION HAS GONE BEYOND THE LOGIC OF THE U.S. POLICY TOWARD LATIN AMERICA. INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS DID, HOWEVER, GUESS THAT SOMETHING WAS ABOUT TO OCCUR WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH SAID RECENTLY THAT WHILE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD REACH AGREEMENT WITH NICARAGUA, WITH NORIEGA IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH ANY AGREEMENT, AND THAT THE UNITED STATES HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS VEILED DANGER THAT THREATENED THE AMERICAN CONTINENT. TODAY, PANAMA HAS BECOME A BATTLEFIELD. THE CAPITAL AND OTHER CITIES ARE BATTLEFIELDS ON WHICH THE GOVERNMENT FORCES ARE FIGHTING THE U.S. UNITS IN GROUND, AIR, AND MARITIME OPERATIONS THAT SEEK TO OUST MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA. THE U.S. ACTION IS FOCUSSING THE WORLD'S ATTENTION ON WASHINGTON'S DECISION. MANY NATIONS WILL PROTEST AND REJECT THE U.S. INVASION WHICH WAS DISGUISED BY A SERIES OF PEACE-SEEKING ACTIONS. FOUR DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS EVE, THE GHOST OF WAR IS HAUNTING OUR CONTINENT. WE MUST PONDER ON THE NEED TO KEEP HONDURAS ON THE DEMOCRATIC PATH, AND TO AVOID THE ANARCHY THAT DESTROYS NATIONS AND DECIMATES PEOPLES. THE EVENTS THAT HAVE KEPT THE WORLD IN VIGIL SINCE MIDNIGHT WILL CONTINUE FOR HOURS, DAYS, OR MAYBE WEEKS BECAUSE, SO FAR, THE NEWS IS VERY CONFUSING AND CIVILIAN VICTIMS ARE DYING ON THE STREETS OF THE PANAMANIAN TOWNS.
TST1-MUC3-0043	CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- COMMANDER, DO THE RN LEADERS AGREE THAT THE FMLN SHOULD EVENTUALLY JOIN THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL AS HAS BEEN PROPOSED CONCERNING THE SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT IN NICARAGUA? WE THINK SO, BECAUSE SI HAS REPRESENTED, FOR THE PAST 30-40 YEARS, A EUROPEAN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL BLOC THAT HAS SUPPORTED THE STRUGGLE.... THAT HAS SHOWN INTEREST IN THE THIRD WORLD. IN OTHER WORDS, WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL BLOC THAT TRULY WANTS TO ESTABLISH RELATIONS AND HELP -- WHILE STILL DEFENDING EUROPEAN INTERESTS -- IS VIABLE AND POSITIVE. THE FMLN MUST NECESSARILY JOIN THE SI. IN THE 1970'S STRUGGLE IN OUR COUNTRY AND THE WAR RESULTED FROM A DECISION ADOPTED BY THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY ARMY . VIRTUALLY NO ONE TALKS ABOUT THIS WITHIN THE FMLN NOW, YET THE RIGHT-WING SECTORS ALWAYS REMEMBER THE RESULTING SITUATIONS WITHIN THE LEFT-WING SECTORS. WHAT DOES THE RN THINK ABUT THE ERP IN 1990? WE HAVE STATED AND WE HAVE PUT IT IN WRITING -- IT IS GOOD TO HAVE IT IN WRITING -- THAT THE LEFT BECAME DIVIDED AND THE ERP BECAME DIVIDED BECAUSE WE WERE NOT FIRM ENOUGH, POLITICALLY AND IDEOLOGICALLY SPEAKING. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ERP LEADERSHIP ACTED CHILDISHLY , BUT WE CAN NOW SAY THAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED MATURITY IN EVERY SECTOR. THE OPTIONS WE HAVE CHOSEN WITHIN THE FMLN HAVE ALLOWED US TO CLEARLY SEE THE OUTCOME OF THE DECISIONS WE ADOPTED IN THE PAST. THIS HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN AND MISCONSTRUED BY THE ENEMY IN ITS PROPAGANDA AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WAR, BECAUSE IT LOVES TO SAY THAT REVOLUTIONARIES ALWAYS END UP KILLING EACH OTHER. THE IDEOLOGICAL STRUGGLE INDICATES THAT WE AND UNITY HAS PREVAILED WITHIN THE FMLN. WE CONSIDER THE DIVISION A PROCESS THAT IS PART OF EL SALVADOR'S HISTORY AND WE SHOULD NOT CRY OVER SPILT MILK. NO ONE SHOULD DEPLORE.... WE CANNOT SPECULATE ON WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED. IT WAS THE RESULT OF OUR IMMATURITY. COMMANDER, EVERYONE KNOWS THE NAMES OF THE FMLN LEADERS -- PARTICULARLY THE FIVE MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL COMMAND -- BUT THIS IS SOMETHING NEW. YOU WERE PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AS FERMAN CIENFUEGOS AND NOT EVERYONE KNEW THAT YOU WERE EDUARDO SANCHO COLOMBARI. THERE IS ALWAYS A CLANDESTINE ELEMENT INVOLVED. WHY IS THERE ALWAYS A TENDENCY TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS? I THINK THAT AFTER 10 OR 20 YEARS IN HIDING WE POLITICAL CONDUCT THAT DOES NOT CORRESPOND TO MODERN TIMES AND OUR POLITICAL NEEDS. THEREFORE, THE GENERAL COMMAND NEEDS SPECIFIC CONDITIONS, MEANING THE NEED FOR THE GENERAL COMMAND MEMBERS TO GO PUBLIC. WE BELIEVE THAT THE GENERAL COMMAND MEMBERS SHOULD GO PUBLIC AND STATE THEIR VIEWS SO THAT THEY PEOPLE CAN LEARN MORE ABOUT THEM, THEIR HUMAN SIDE, AND THEIR PERSONALITIES. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE PEOPLE AND THE WORLD TO KNOW ABOUT THE LEADERS' PERSONALITIES AS THEY ARE. THIS HAS BEEN -- LET US CALL IT A DEFECT OR LIMITATION. SECRECY IS A DEVIATION AND A PERSON CAN MAINTAIN.... COMBINE SECRECY WITH OUR POLITICAL ROLE. WE NOW WE HAVE TO OVERCOME THAT DEVIATION, MEANING SECRECY AND ANONYMITY. YES. I BELIEVE WE ARE TRYING TO OVERCOME THIS.
TST1-MUC3-0044	SAN SALVADOR, 2 MAY 90 -- WE NOW HAVE COLONEL SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ ON THE TELEPHONE. THE ARMED FORCES, PARTICULARLY THE COMMANDERS OF THE VARIOUS ARMY BRANCHES AND GARRISONS WHO WERE CONVENED BY THE DEFENSE MINISTER, MADE A STATEMENT AGAINST THIS OFFICER, WHO IS A DEPUTY AND THE CURRENT CEL PRESIDENT, AFTER HE DEMANDED JUSTICE IN THE CASE OF THE ASSASSINATED JESUIT PRIESTS. WE WILL NOW LISTEN TO COL OCHOA, WHO WILL MAKE KNOWN HIS STAND SINCE THE ARMED FORCES' STATEMENT WAS RELEASED. GOOD MORNING, COLONEL. GOOD MORNING. THANKS, RAUL. THESE GENTLEMEN SEEM TO BE SPEAKING IN THE NAME OF THE ENTIRE ARMED FORCES. I KNOW WELL WHAT WAS DISCUSSED IN THE MEETING. SOMEONE EVEN SAID THAT THE BRIGHT IDEA OF DISCHARGING ME WAS CONSIDERED. THEY FAILED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT, HOWEVER, THAT I AM A DEPUTY AND THAT, AS A DEPUTY AND A CITIZEN, I AM ENTITLED TO EXPRESS WHAT I FEEL, JUST AS I HAVE DONE. I, WHO OWE EVERYTHING TO THE ARMED FORCES, WHO FOUGHT BESIDE THE SOLDIERS AS MONTERROSA, CARLITOS, AND VERY FEW OTHERS DID, NEVER GOT RICH WHEN IN THE ARMED FORCES, AS SOME OF THE COMMANDERS DID, ALTHOUGH NOT ALL OF THEM, OF COURSE. THIS UNDOUBTEDLY HAS IRRITATED THEM. I HAVE SIMPLY EXPRESSED MY VIEWPOINT AS A SOLDIER CONCERNED ABOUT THE ARMED FORCES' SITUATION. I NEVER MENTIONED ANY NAMES. I SIMPLY DEMANDED JUSTICE BECAUSE, EVEN ACCORDING TO MILITARY THEORY, I CANNOT CONCEIVE THAT SUCH AN IMPORTANT DECISION COULD HAVE BEEN MADE BY A SINGLE PERSON. I STILL THINK THIS IS A PLOT BY SOME MEMBERS OF THE INSTITUTION, NOT BY THE ARMED FORCES AS SUCH. I ONLY HAVE RESPECT AND LOVE FOR THE ARMED FORCES. I AM CONCERNED OVER THE DELICATE SITUATION TO WHICH THE INSTITUTION COULD BE LED BECAUSE OF THE ACTIONS OF SOME NEFARIOUS MEMBERS. I HAVE DEEP RESPECT FOR THE OFFICERS IN THE FIELD, WHO FIGHT EVERY DAY. OF COURSE, I MUST CRITICIZE THOSE WHO HAVE PROFITED FROM THE INSTITUTION AND WHO TODAY HAVE RAISED THE ROOF, AS IF I WERE THE ONE TO BLAME AND AS IF I WERE UNDERMINING THE INSTITUTIONALITY OF THE STATE. QUITE THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE. MY CRITICISM IS POSITIVE AND INTENDS TO ENCOURAGE A DEEPER INVESTIGATION AND EXHAUST ALL RESOURCES IN THIS DIRECTION. I WOULD LIKE THEM TO STOP MAKING RIDICULOUS DEMANDS AND TO STOP SEEKING A CONFRONTATION. IT IS KNOWN THAT WHAT I AM DEMANDING IS WHAT IS BEING FELT AND SAID. I AM NOT ACCUSING ANYONE IN PARTICULAR. I AM ONLY DEMANDING JUSTICE. COMMANDERS' MEETINGS SHOULD NOT BE HELD TO MAKE SUCH A STATEMENT. THEY SHOULD HAVE INSTEAD SHOWN THEIR CONCERN OVER THE ARMED FORCES' SITUATION. I WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY INTERESTED IN SEEING THEM TAKE THE STAND TO CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION TO THE LAST CONSEQUENCES. AS THE MILITARY MAN I AM, I ONLY ASSESSED THE SITUATION. I NEVER MENTIONED ANY NAMES, BUT INSISTED THAT A DEEPER INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE TO CARRY OUT JUSTICE, BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT IS THE INSTITUTION THAT WILL SUFFER. COL OCHOA, AFTER THE "SIXTY MINUTES" PROGRAM ON CBS IN THE UNITED STATES, IT SEEMS THAT IN THIS CAPITAL AND IN THE COUNTRY YOUR REMARKS AND YOUR INTERPRETATION OF THE JESUITS' CASE WERE DISTORTED. TODAY THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO ACCUSE YOU. IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT THE CUT IN U.S. AID TO THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES IS THE RESULT OF YOUR REMARKS, RATHER THAN OF THE SLOWNESS IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THE JEUSIT PRIESTS' CASE. DO YOU THINK THERE HAS BEEN ILL INTENT IN THIS, OR THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU TO TRY TO JUSTIFY AN ACTION? I THINK SO. THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO BLAME ME, AS IF I COULD INFLUENCE THE DECISION-MAKING OF THE U.S. CONGRESS. A REDUCTION IN MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR HAS BEEN UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR MONTHS BECAUSE THE EXPECTED RESULTS HAVE NOT BEEN OBTAINED. I THINK IT IS RIDICULOUS AND CHILDISH TO SAY THAT THE AID WILL BE CUT AS THE RESULT OF MY REMARKS. THE TRUTH IS THAT ALL CRIMES WITH WHICH SOME ARMED FORCES' MEMBERS HAVE JEOPARDIZED THE INSTITUTION SHOULD BE PUNISHED. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SOLIDARITY SHOULD EXIST IN THE CONTEXT OF OPERATIONS AND THE FULFILLMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES' CONSTITUTIONAL MISSION. HOWEVER, THOSE WHO HARM THE INSTITUTION SHOULD NOT BE PROTECTED. I THINK SOME ARE TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION, AS IF TO SAY: COL OCHOA HAS ENDANGERED THE ARMED FORCES. WHAT HAS ENDANGERED THE INSTITUTION IS THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS AND THE SAN SEBASTIAN PEOPLE. I CANOT AGREE WITH THE PERPETRATION OF OUTRAGES. ONE THING IS TO FIGHT FAIRLY WITH THE ENEMY. THERE ARE DEAD IN EVERY WAR. I SAID THIS VERY CLEARLY WHEN I WAS 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE COMMANDER IN CABANAS. I AGREED WITH THE PENETRATION INTO THE POPULATION TO HELP THEM. I FEEL SATISFIED OVER MY PASSAGE THROUGH THE ARMED FORCES AS A COMMANDER, BECAUSE I IDENTIFIED MYSELF BOTH WITH MY MEN AND THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. AT NO TIME DID I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE INSTITUTION TO ACQUIRE ILLEGAL RICHES. TO POINT THESE THINGS OUT IS NOT TO ATTACK THE ARMED FORCES. QUITE THE CONTRARY, IT IS BECAUSE I LOVE IT THAT I HAVE CRITICIZED THE NEGATIVE MEMBERS. THE ARMED FORCES CAN THUS BE SPARED GREATER DAMAGE BY THE POOR ACTIONS OF SOME OF ITS MEMBERS. COLONEL, IN THE PAST FEW HOURS WE HAVE HEARD REPORTS THAT YOU ARE TO BE SUPPORTED BY THE ARMY'S YOUNGER OFFICERS AND SOME UNIONS, EVEN THE CEL UNION. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THIS SITUATION?
TST1-MUC3-0045	SAN SALVADOR, 3 DEC 89 -- TODAY THE SALVADORAN DEFENSE MINISTRY FLATLY DENIED CHARGES RAISED YESTERDAY BY AN ALLEGED "JUNIOR OFFICERS' COMMAND" THAT BLAMES CERTAIN OFFICERS OF THE ARMED FORCES FOR THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS. IN A COMMUNIQUE RELEASED TODAY, THE DEFENSE MINISTRY CATEGORICALLY REJECTED "ALL TYPES OF SLANDER AND CHARGES AGAINST ITS MEMBERS," REFERRING TO THE ABOVEMENTIONED DOCUMENT THAT IT SAID "LACKS ALL LOGIC AND CREDIBILITY." THE OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE POINTED OUT THAT "IN THESE MOMENTS, THE ARMED FORCES ARE UNITED MORE THAN EVER BEFORE IN THE DEFENSE OF THE FATHERLAND," ADDING THAT THE DOCUMENT ANONYMOUSLY DISTRIBUTED YESTERDAY TO THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS IS "GREY PROPAGANDA." IN THE FOUR-PAGE DOCUMENT, A SO-CALLED "JUNIOR OFFICERS' COMMAND" STATES THAT "COLONEL HECTOR HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ, CHIEF OF THE TREASURY POLICE, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDERS." THE AUTHORS OF THE COMMUNIQUE ADD THAT THE "TROOPS FROM THAT SECURITY CORPS LED BY CAPTAIN ALONSO CHAVEZ GARCIA" CARRIED OUT THE EXECUTIONS," BUT IT DID NOT PROVIDE ANY DETAILS TO BACK UP THE ACCUSATIONS. THE SIX JESUITS AND TWO MORE PERSONS WERE KILLED ON 16 NOVEMBER, SHOT DURING THE NIGHT BY A GROUP OF ARMED INDIVIDUALS WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS, ACCORDING TO WITNESSES OF THE CRIME. THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS INITIATED AN INVESTIGATION, INVITING FOREIGN EXPERTS TO PARTICIPATE. THE OFFICIAL DEFENSE MINISTRY NOTE WARNED THAT "THE FORCE THAT MAINTAINS THIS SOLID UNITY IS THE BLOOD SHED BY OUR SOLDIERS TO DEFEND THE FATHERLAND AND OUR IDEAS, CUSTOMS, RELIGION, DEMOCRACY, AND FREEDOM." THE MINISTRY'S COMMUNIQUE URGES THE CITIZENS "NOT TO ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE DECEIVED BY THE AMOUNT OF RUMORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSURES THAT THE MARXIST BOOKS OF THEORY CLEARLY DEFINE AS A FORM OF STRUGGLE TO ACHIEVE POWER." THE COMMUNIQUE ALSO DISCLOSES THAT FORMER CAPTAIN MAURICIO MENA SANDOVAL, WHO JOINED THE GUERRILLAS IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES, HAS MADE TELEPHONE CALLS OR SENT "PERSONAL NOTES" TO CHIEFS OR OFFICERS. "THESE CRIMINAL TERRORISTS RESORT TO THIS TYPE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TACTICS WHEN THEY FEEL THEY ARE LOST OR DESPERATE," THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS, REFERRING TO THE FAILURE OF THE OFFENSIVE THAT THE GUERRILLAS LAUNCHED ON 11 NOVEMBER.
TST1-MUC3-0046	SAN SALVADOR, 6 JUL 89 -- THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE A FEW HOURS AGO DENYING THAT IT DIRECTED AN ATTACK AGAINST SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE PRESIDENT MAURICIO GUTIERREZ CASTRO. THE REBEL COMMUNIQUE READS: ON THE AFTERNOON OF 2 JULY, FMLN GUERRILLAS CARRIED OUT PROPAGANDA ACTIVITY AND OCCUPIED 8 KM OF THE ROAD TO LA LIBERTAD PORT, BETWEEN THE 14- AND 21-KM MARKERS, WHERE THEY ERECTED A BARRICADE. THE GUERRILLAS ADDED THAT THEY STOPPED APPROXIMATELY 200 VEHICLES TO MEET AND EXCHANGE VIEWS WITH THE DRIVERS. AT THE 14-KM MARKER, A VEHICLE IN WHICH BODYGUARDS WERE RIDING ARRIVED, BUT THE DRIVER DID NOT OBEY THE ORDER TO STOP, WHICH PROVOKED A CLASH WITH OUR UNITS. TWO MEN WERE WOUNDED AND ONE WOMAN WAS KILLED AS A RESULT OF THAT INCIDENT. OUR FORCES REPORTED THAT THEY SEIZED ONE M-16 RIFLE AND ONE .45 - CALIBER PISTOL. THE FMLN DOCUMENT ADDS THAT MINUTES LATER, AT THE 21-KM MARKER, THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE PRESIDENT'S BODYGUARDS TRIED TO SURPRISE OUR FIGHTERS AND ANOTHER CLASH OCCURRED. DURING THE CLASH, ONE BODYGUARD WAS KILLED AND THE ARENA OFFICIAL WAS WOUNDED. PARAGRAPH THREE OF THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS THAT THE ARMED PROPAGANDA ACTIVITIES ALONG THE LA LIBERTAD PORT - SAN SALVADOR ROUTE ARE AIMED AT DISTRIBUTING PROPAGANDA AND AT DESTABILIZING THIS VITAL ROUTE USED BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND MILITARY MEN TO TRAVEL TO THEIR PRIVATE CLUBS LOCATED ALONG THE COAST. THE FMLN, THE DOCUMENT ADDS, REITERATES ITS DETERMINATION TO STOP THOSE WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THE GENOCIDAL WAR -- THOSE WHO EVERY DAY SHELL THE RURAL AREAS AND PERSECUTE AND MURDER PEASANTS, WORKERS, AND STUDENTS -- FROM TAKING IT EASY AND RELAXING AT THEIR CLUBS AND IN THEIR EXCLUSIVE NEIGHBORHOODS. THE ATTACK ON THE NATIONAL POLICE STATION AT THE MANUEL JOSE ARCE MILITARY NEIGHBORHOOD FOLLOWS THIS SAME LINE OF DESTABILIZATION. THEREFORE, WE CALL ON OUR PEOPLE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND ORDERS ISSUED BY OUR FIGHTERS AND TO THEREBY PREVENT REGRETTABLE LOSSES. WE WARN BODYGUARDS AND SECURITY GUARDS THAT WE WILL FIGHT THOSE WHO ARE ARMED AND WHO OFFER RESISTANCE. IN CONCLUSION, THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE RELEASED A FEW HOURS AGO ADDS: WE REITERATE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO ABIDE BY OUR REVOLUTIONARY PRINCIPLES AND STICK TO THE TRUTH. WE DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN INCIDENTS SUCH AS THE ATTACK AGAINST ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH AND EDGAR CHACON . THESE INCIDENTS RESULTED FROM A WAR WITHIN ARENA RANKS, AND WE WARN THAT ACTS OF REPRESSION UNLEASHED BY THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE POPULAR AND DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENTS WILL NOT GO UNPUNISHED AND WILL RECEIVE A STRONG RESPONSE FROM OUR FORCES. THIS WAS THE RECENT FMLN COMMUNIQUE ON THE INCIDENTS THAT OCCURRED ON 2 JULY ON THE ROAD TO LA LIBERTAD PORT, WHERE THE PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE WAS WOUNDED.
TST1-MUC3-0047	QUITO, 26 AUG 89 -- ECUADOR TODAY CONCEDED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE MAY BE COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN ECUADORAN TERRITORY, ALTHOUGH IT EMPHASIZED THAT BORDER CONTROLS HAVE BEEN REINFORCED "TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF VIOLENCE AND TERROR." ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE PRESENCE OF MEMBERS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, INTERIOR MINISTER ANDRES VALLEJO SAID: "IT IS POSSIBLE. HOWEVER, THERE ARE QUITE RELIABLE REPORTS THAT THEY HAVE MORE LIKELY FLED TO OTHER COUNTRIES." THE MINISTER REVEALED THAT A FINANCING COMPANY, WHICH HE DID NOT IDENTIFY, WAS CLOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE IT WAS FOUND TO BE LAUNDERING DOLLARS OBTAINED FROM THE TRAFFICKING. "THERE WILL BE NO MERCY IN SUCH CASES," HE SAID. OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, PRESS REPORTS MENTIONED ECUADOR AS ONE OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE TOP LEADERS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL HAD REPORTEDLY TAKEN REFUGE TO ESCAPE THE ACTIONS LAUNCHED BY THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT FOLLOWING A SERIES OF ASSASSINATIONS COMMITTED BY THE DRUG MAFIAS. EARLY THIS WEEK, ECUADOR REINFORCED ITS EXTENSIVE BORDER WITH COLOMBIA TO KEEP THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS OUT. ASSESSING THE STATUS OF DRUGS IN ECUADOR, THE MINISTER ADMITTED THAT "SEVERAL LARGE ESTATES HAVE BEEN PURCHASED BY PEOPLE WHO APPEAR TO BE LINKED TO THE DRUG TRAFFIC." HOWEVER, HE EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT THESE PURCHASES WERE LINKED TO MONEY LAUNDERING RATHER THAN THE PRODUCTION OF DRUGS. VALLEJO ALSO SAID THAT ECUADOR HAS "SEVERELY" RESTRICTED IMPORTS OF CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES USED IN THE PRELIMINARY PHASES OF THE REFINING OF NARCOTICS. FORMER FREE ACCESS TO THOSE SUBSTANCES HAD BEEN CONVERTING THE COUNTRY INTO AN ALTERNATIVE BASE FOR THE PRODUCTION AND SHIPMENT OF DRUGS TO THE UNITED STATES AND WESTERN EUROPE.
TST1-MUC3-0048	BOGOTA, 6 JUN 89 -- PASTO -- COMMERCE AT THE ECUADORAN BORDER IS VIRTUALLY PARALYZED AFTER THE BORDER WAS CLOSED IN THE WAKE OF SERIOUS INCIDENTS BETWEEN STRIKING TRANSPORTERS AND ECUADORAN POLICE. ONE PERSON WAS KILLED IN TULCAN, CARCHI PROVINCE. MEANWHILE, THE SITUATION REMAINS TENSE IN THE REST OF ECUADOR BECAUSE OF THE PROLONGED STRIKE OF DRIVERS WHO ARE PROTESTING AGAINST DRASTIC ECONOMIC MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT RODRIGO BORJA. AS A RESULT, COMMERCE BETWEEN TULCAN AND IPIALES, THE TWO MOST ACTIVE CITIES AT THE BORDER, IS VIRTUALLY PARALYZED.
TST1-MUC3-0049	POPAYAN, 23 MAR 90 -- MEMBERS OF THE 8TH FRONT OF THE SELF-STYLED REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA HAVE CARRIED OUT TERRORIST ATTACKS IN SOUTHERN CAUCA DEPARTMENT TO PROTEST PATRIOTIC UNION PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA'S MURDER. THE FARC MEMBERS BLEW UP A POWER SUBSTATION AND A POWER PYLON IN SAJANDI, LA FONDA CORREGIMIENTO. THE GUERRILLAS ALSO BURNED THREE VEHICLES ON THE PAN-AMERICAN HIGHWAY-- A BALBOA HOSPITAL AMBULANCE, A FUEL TRUCK CARRYING 3,000 GALLONS OF GASOLINE, AND A STATION WAGON. A LARGE SECTION OF EL PATIA VALLEY WAS LEFT WITHOUT ELECTRICITY. THROUGH SEVERAL TELEPHONE CALLS TO THE POPAYAN MEDIA, THE 8TH FARC FRONT DECLARED THE PAN-AMERICAN HIGHWAY A MILITARY TARGET DURING THE NEXT 48 HOURS IN ORDER TO DEMAND THAT THE GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATE AND ARREST THOSE WHO ARE TRULY RESPONSIBLE FOR JARAMILLO'S MURDER. TRANSPORTATION SERVICES BETWEEN AND PASTO IN SOUTHERN COLOMBIA HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED AS A RESULT OF THE TERRORIST ATTACKS, WHICH BEGAN AT 0300 TODAY. POLICE AND 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE MEMBERS WERE DEPLOYED TO THE AREAS WHERE THE 8TH FRONT OF THE SELF-STYLED REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA BLOCKED TRAFFIC. THE 8TH FARC FRONT MEMBERS SAID THEIR MILITARY ACTIONS ARE AIMED AT DEMANDING THE CLARIFICATION OF UP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BERNARDO JARAMILLO'S MURDER. THE POPAYAN POLICE DEPARTMENT CONFIRMED THAT THE ATTACKS TOOK PLACE ON THE PAN-AMERICAN HIGHWAY AND AT LA FONDA CORREGIMIENTO, PATIA MUNICIPALITY. GOVERNOR FERNANDO IRACONI SAID THAT THE REGIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL WILL MEET IN POPAYAN IN A FEW MINUTES TO ASSESS THE MOST RECENT TERRORIST ATTACKS AND TO ADOPT THE NECESSARY MEASURES.
TST1-MUC3-0050	PANAMA CITY , 16 NOV 89 -- PANAMA'S ARCHBISHOP MARCOS MCGRATH, PANAMA'S EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE PRESIDENT JOSE LUIS LACUNZA, AND PANAMANIAN ABDIEL ADAMES, PRESIDENT OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN HIGHER UNIVERSITY COUNCIL , HAVE CONDEMNED THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUITS IN EL SALVADOR AT DAWN TODAY. MCGRATH, WHO DESCRIBED THE MULTIPLE ASSASSINATION AS "MONSTROUS," POINTED OUT THAT "IT IS EVERYBODY'S DUTY, ESPECIALLY OF THAT COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENT, TO IDENTIFY, ARREST, AND TRY THE CULPRITS AND THOSE WHO ORDERED THE ACTION." THIS "MUST NOT ONLY BE A JUST TRIAL OF THEM, BUT ALSO A MEANS TO ELOQUENTLY EXPRESS THE REJECTION OF THE ENTIRE SOCIETY, WHICH CALLS ITSELF CHRISTIAN, AGAINST SUCH A CRUEL AND UNJUST CRIME THAT REVEALS ABSOLUTE CONTEMPT FOR HUMAN LIFE," A COMMUNIQUE SIGNED BY ARCHBISHOP MCGRATH STATES. ACCORDING TO SOURCES FROM EL SALVADOR'S JESUIT CURIA, THE SPANISH JESUIT IGNACIO ELLACURIA, RECTOR OF EL SALVADOR'S CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY , FIVE OTHER PRIESTS, AND TWO SALVADORAN WOMEN WERE MURDERED AT DAWN TODAY BY MEN WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS. IN THE OPINION OF SPANISH BISHOP JOSE LUIS LACUNZA, SECRETARY OF PANAMA'S EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE AND RECTOR OF SANTA MARIA LA ANTIGUA UNIVERSITY, "THESE ASSASSINATIONS WERE PERPETRATED WITH MALICE AND IN COLD BLOOD." "THEY ARE CERTAINLY TO BE CONDEMNED, REGARDLESS OF WHO CARRIED THEM OUT," HE ADDED. CSUCA PRESIDENT PANAMANIAN ABDIEL ADAMES DESCRIBED AS "ABOMINABLE" AND "REPREHENSIBLE" THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX PRIESTS AND TWO WOMEN. ADAMES, WHO IS ALSO RECTOR OF PANAMA'S NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, REJECTED THE ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE "AS A MEANS TO REACH AGREEMENTS IN EL SALVADOR, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT PRIESTS HAVE BEEN KILLED." CSUCA WILL ASK THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT TO DECLARE UCA A "SANCTUARY" OR "NEUTRAL ZONE" TO TREAT THOSE WOUNDED IN THE CLASHES BETWEEN THE ARMY AND GUERRILLAS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE 11 NOVEMBER IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER TOWNS, ADAMES POINTED OUT. CSUCA COORDINATOR AND SALVADORAN GUILLERMO GALVAN SAID TODAY IN SAN JOSE THAT HE ASKED PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS TO "MEDIATE TO BRING ABOUT A SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT AND STEP UP EFFORTS TO PREVENT "MASSACRES" AND "SELECTIVE MURDERS."
TST1-MUC3-0051	SANTIAGO, 18 AUG 89 -- ARICA -- TWO BOLIVIANS CARRYING 2.5 KG PURE COCAINE IN A HANDBAG HAVE BEEN ARRESTED BY CARABINEROS OS-7 DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL. THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS ENTERED THE COUNTRY ON BYCICLES THROUGH THE AREA OF VISVIRI. THE DETAINEES ARE JORGE GONZALEZ LLUCRA, 20, AND MARIO GONZALEZ LLUCRA, 19. THE POLICE ALSOS SEIZED A BROWING PISTOL FROM ONE OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WHO FIRED THREE SHOTS BUT HIT NO ONE.
TST1-MUC3-0052	BOGOTA, 4 FEB 90 -- I BELIEVE THAT HERE IN THE DEPARTMENT, THE EXPERIENCE WITH MAYORS ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE, HAS BEEN SATISFACTORY. MOST OF THEM HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE TO THE COMMUNITIES THEY REPRESENT. THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING AND ALL HAVE A FAVORABLE BALANCE. WHY NOT ALLOW CITIZENS TO FREELY AND SPONTANEOUSLY EXCERCISE THE RIGHT TO VOTE AGAIN. THIS WOULD CONTINUE THE DEMOCRATIZATION AND DECENTRALIZATION PROCESS NEEDED BY THE COUNTRY TO PROGRESS AND FIND PEACE. I BELIEVE WE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE WONDERFUL SERVICES RENDERED BY DR. RAFAEL PARDO, THE NATIONAL REHABILITATION PLAN DIRECTOR, TO ATTEMPT TO FIND NEW ROADS TOWARD ACHIEVING DIALOGUE WITH THESE TWO SECTORS, ESPECIALLY WITH THE ELN. IT IS NOT EASY TO FIND PEACE, ESPECIALLY FOR THIS DEPARTMENT. WE MUST AT LEAST MAKE ATTEMPTS TO HOLD DIALOGUE WITH THIS GUERRILLA GROUP, WHICH HAS SHOWN IT CAN EASILY MOVE AROUND AND DISRUPT STABILITY AND PUBLIC ORDER IN THE DEPARTMENT OF NORTH SANTANDER. MR. GOVERNOR, UP TO NOW, HAVE ELN OR EPL SUBVERSIVES TRIED TO ATTAIN THIS DIALOGUE? WELL, NO. IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY, BESIDES WE BELIEVE THESE ARE INITIATIVES THAT SHOULD BE STARTED BY THE PEACE COMMISSIONERS, AS THEY HAVE EXPERIENCE IN SUCH CONVERSATIONS, CONTACTS, AND DIALOGUES. THAT IS WHY I MENTIONED THAT, PERHAPS, THROUGH DR. RAFAEL PARDO, WHO HAS BEEN THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT'S DELEGATE, ATTEMPTS WILL BE MADE TO SEARCH FOR SUCH POSSIBILITIES. I BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN MAKING EFFORTS TO ATTAIN PEACE IN THE COUNTRY, AND THE QUICKER WE ATTAIN THIS, THE BETTER IT WILL BE FOR THE SECURITY AND STABILITY OF COLOMBIA. HAVE YOU ALREADY SENT AN INVITATION OR ASKED DR. RAFAEL PARDO TO COME TO YOUR DEPARTMENT? WE HAVE TALKED TO HIM OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS ABOUT THE PUBLIC ORDER SITUATION AND OTHER SITUATIONS THAT REQUIRE SPECIAL ATTENTION. HOWEVER, THE ENTIRE COUNTRY KNOWS THAT DR. PARDO HAS BEEN WORKING VIRTUALLY FULL-TIME TO FURTHER THE PEACE CONVERSATIONS WITH M-19. THE ENTIRE COUNTRY HAS BEEN PLEASED AND VERY HAPPY WITH THESE CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN AN IMPORTANT INITIATION FOR PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S PEACE PROCESS. BUT DR. RAFAEL PARDO RUEDA DOES NOT DISLIKE THE IDEA OF HOLDING SUCH CONVERSATIONS? I AM SURE HE DOES NOT DISLIKE THE IDEA BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO THIS FOR A LONG TIME. WHEN COULD THESE CONVERSATIONS TAKE PLACE? JUST GIVE US A TENTATIVE DATE. COULD IT BE WITHIN DAYS OR THIS WEEK? SURELY THIS WEEK WE WILL AGAIN HAVE TO STUDY THE PUBLIC ORDER SITUATION IN OUR DEPARTMENT AND SURELY WE WILL BE ABLE TO ANALYZE THIS PROPOSAL AGAIN AND I BELIEVE DR. PARDO WILL SERIOUSLY TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT. SOME OF THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL LEADERS -- NOT ONLY IN NORTHERN SANTANDER, BUT IN SEVERAL AREAS OF THE COUNTRY -- ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONSTANT RAIDS BY SUBVERSIVE GROUPS, AND THEIR MURDERED MAYORS, OFFICIALS, AND POLITICAL LEADERS AND THE KIDNAPPING OF NATIONAL CIVIL REGISTRY OFFICE PERSONNEL. THEY INDICATE THAT WITH ACTIONS OF THIS TYPE IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO FREELY EXPRESS THEMSELVES BY VOTING IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS. YES, SURELY ALL THESE INCIDENTS CAN, IN A CERTAIN MANNER, WEAKEN THE ELECTORAL VOTE. HOWEVER, EVERYDAY WE ARE MORE CONVINCED THAT COLOMBIANS WANT TO EXCERCISE THIS RIGHT WITHOUT ANY TYPE OF LIMITATIONS AND MAKE EFFORTS -- INCLUDING HEROIC ACTIONS -- TO CONTINUE THIS CAMPAIGN SO THAT ELECTIONS CAN BE HELD THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL TERRITORY. VOTING IS THE REAL EXPRESSION OF DEMOCRACY AND WE WILL ALL FIGHT FOR IT. WE ARE SURE THAT THE GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THE ARMED FORCES, WILL DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE FOR THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS TO BE HELD WITHOUT PROBLEMS. HOWEVER, IT IS A HUGE EFFORT, AS IT HAS TO CONFRONT A SERIES OF APPREHENSIONS OR FEARS THAT HAVE BEEN INSTILLED IN SOME PEOPLE.
TST1-MUC3-0053	CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- COL VARGAS' REACTION WAS TO BECOME DESPERATE BECAUSE 90-MM, 60-MM, AND 81-MM MORTARS, AND 85-MM FIELD GUNS HAVE BEEN INDISCRIMINATELY FIRED AGAINST THAT SECTOR OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD FOR 3 DAYS; ROCKETS HAVE BEEN FIRED FROM AIRPLANES. MANY CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN WOUNDED AND MANY HOUSES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. IN OTHER WORDS, THERE HAS BEEN NO RESPECT WHATSOEVER -- PERHAPS BECAUSE THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE LOCATED CLOSEST TO THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE, AND THAT SEEMS TO WORRY THIS MAN VERY MUCH. THIS COULD BE THE REASON FOR SUCH AN ATTITUDE AND FOR THAT GENOCIDAL SITUATION. IN OTHER PLACES, CLASHES OCCURRED PRACTICALLY ALL DAY LONG ON 12 AND 13 NOVEMBER, AND DURING THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF 14 NOVEMBER IN THE MILAGRO DE LA PAZ NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE WE CAUSED A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES. IN ADDITION, OUR FORCES FOILED AND STOPPED THE ARCE BATTALION, PONCE BATTALION, LEON BATTALION, AND THE MONTERROSA FORCES SURVEILLANCE AND SECURITY MEASURES, AND TO HANDLE ANY TYPE OF EMERGENCY, INCLUDING BOMBINGS, MORTAR ATTACKS, AND STRAFINGS. THIS MEANS THAT THE TERRAIN MUST BE PREPARED TO DEFEND THE POPULATION. WE ALSO HAVE A NUMBER OF INSTRUCTION REGARDING THE TASKS TO BE DONE DURING TIMES OF COMBAT, BUT THIS IS GEARED TOWARD THE POPULATION WHO DECIDES TO PARTICIPATE BY DIRECTLY SUPPORTING THE FMLN. THIS INVOLVES MANY PEOPLE. THEY CAN JOIN NEW FORCES AND GROUPS IN CHARGE OF THE TRENCHES, SECURITY MEASURES, COURIERS, AND ALL KINDS OF TASKS TO SUPPORT THE WAR. IN SUM, THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE POPULATION ARE TO ORGANIZE THEMSELVES BECAUSE, ONCE ORGANIZED, THEY CAN GIVE AND COUNTER IT. THE OTHER ISSUE IS THE CALLS TO THE POPULATION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STRUGGLE AND ABOVE ALL NOT TO LET ANYONE INTIMIDATE THEM. THEY SHOULD NOT LET ANYONE STOP THEM FROM GOING OUT TO PURCHASE THEIR FOOD AND WHATEVER ELSE THEY NEED. GIVEN THE EMERGENCY SITUATION AND THE SHORTAGE OF MEDICINE AND FOOD, WE THINK IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE PEOPLE OF SAN MIGUEL TO OPEN THE STORES WHERE THEY CAN GET FOOD, MEDICINE, AND ANY OTHER ITEMS WHICH ARE URGENTLY NEEDED FOR THEIR AND SURVIVAL. THAT IS ALL FOR NOW. GREETINGS TO THE COMRADES WHO ARE LISTENING IN THE CAPITAL, ALL THE COMRADE FIGHTERS, AND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE IN GENERAL. THEIR HIGH MORALE AND ACTIVE ROLE IN THE CAPITAL MAKES US FEEL PROUD. WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE VICTORY IS GUARANTEED. WE ARE PREPARED TO DO LIKEWISE AND WE SEND THEM THE COURAGEOUS, FRATERNAL, AND REVOLUTIONARY GREETINGS FROM ALL THE COMMANDERS AND FIGHTERS IN SAN MIGUEL.
TST1-MUC3-0054	LIMA, 15 AUG 89 -- GOOD EVENING. THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN IS NOW UNDER WAY. TEN CANDIDATES ARE RUNNING FOR MAYOR OF LIMA. WE MUST PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS TO PRESERVE DEMOCRACY IN OUR COUNTRY. HOWEVER, THE ELECTORAL ATMOSPHERE THAT PREVAILS SHOULD NOT MAKE US FORGET OUR MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM, THE GREATEST THREAT TO OUR FATHERLAND. THIS THREAT IS TERRORISM WHICH COSTS LIVES, INFLICTS ECONOMIC HARM, FOSTERS INSECURITY, AND CUTS OFF THE POWER THAT WE NEED FOR OUR HOMES AND OUR INDUSTRIES. WE CONTINUE TO BATTLE TERRORISM. THE ARMED FORCES AND THE NATIONAL POLICE ARE TAKING DRASTIC ACTION IN THE HUALLAGA VALLEY AND IN THE MOUNTAIN RANGE. THEY ARE ALSO BREAKING UP URBAN TERRORIST CELLS. HOWEVER, WE MUST ALSO ATTACK TERRORISTS THROUGH LEGAL ACTIONS, THROUGH THE MOST DRASTIC AND SEVERE SENTENCES. IRRESPECTIVE OF MILITARY ACTIONS, IF NO SWIFT AND DRASTIC LEGAL PUNISHMENT IS METED, THE TERRORISTS KNOW THAT THEY WILL GO UNPUNISHED. STIMULATED BY THIS THEY CONTINUE WITH THEIR CRIMES. THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS AWARE OF THIS. MOST PERUVIANS WANT SEVERE, DRASTIC AND EFFECTIVE PUNISHMENT FOR TERRORISTS. THUS, ON 28 JULY I PROPOSED TO THE NATIONAL CONGRESS THAT THE MILITARY COURTS SHOULD TRY TERRORISTS. TONIGHT, I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU OF THIS SUBJECT BECAUSE I AM CONCERNED THAT IT MAY REMAIN JUST THAT; A PROPOSAL. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ASK ALL PERUVIANS, ALL ORGANIZATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS, TO SUPPORT THIS REQUEST WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED IN CONGRESS. BY HAVING TERRORISTS TRIED BY MILITARY COURTS WE ARE NOT GIVING UP ANY CIVILIAN PREROGATIVES. WE ARE NOT GIVING UP ANY DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS. THIS HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE IN OTHER DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES. FURTHERMORE, THE ARMED FORCES ARE AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF PERU'S DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. THEY ARE ALSO THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY FIGHT THE BATTLE AGAINST SUBVERSION. NO ONE CAN SAY THAT SETTING UP MILITARY COURTS IS TANTAMOUNT TO MILITARIZING THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THAT WOULD IMPLY DISTRUSTING THE ARMED FORCES, OFFENDING THEM AND OVERLOOKING THE FACT THAT THEY ARE DEFENDING DEMOCRACY. MORE THAN 2 YEARS AGO WE ASKED FOR AND WERE ALLOWED TO ESTABLISH SPECIAL COURTS TO TERRORIST CASES. SO FAR THESE COURTS HAVE YIELDED NO POSITIVE RESULTS. THUS, AS PRESIDENT IT IS MY DUTY TO CALL FOR SEVERE SENTENCES, ISSUED WITHOUT DELAY OR ANY THEORETICAL OR ACADEMIC DISCUSSIONS. FOLLOWING MY 28 JULY SPEECH I ASCERTAINED THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PERUVIANS ARE IN FAVOR OF DRASTIC PUNISHMENTS AND OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MILITARY COURTS. I HAVE ALSO HEARD SOME LEGAL OBJECTIONS AND THEORETICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS MEASURE. THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT THE MILITARY COURTS TO TRY TERRORISTS SAY THAT ARTICLE 282 OF THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT ALLOW IT. THIS IS HALF TRUE. ARTICLE 282 STATES: IN CASES OF CRIMES COMMITTED WHILE ON DUTY, POLICE AND ARMED FORCES MEMBERS ARE SUBJECT TO THE MILITARY JURISDICTION AND TO THE MILITARY CODE OF JUSTICE WHICH IS NOT APPLICABLE TO CIVILIANS EXCEPT IN THE CASE DESCRIBED BY ARTICLE 235, WHICH ESTABLISHES THE APPLICATION OF THE DEATH SENTENCE IN CASE OF BETRAYAL OF THE MOTHERLAND DURING WAR. NOW, THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT MILITARY COURTS TO TRY TERRORISTS DO NOT WANT TO READ THE SECOND PART OF ARTICLE 282 WHICH STATES: THOSE WHO AVOID COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE ARE SUBJECT TO THE MILITARY CODE OF JUSTICE. THIS PARAGRAPH IS THE ONE THAT LEGALLY AND CONSTITUTIONALLY ALLOWS US TO TRY TERRORISTS UNDER THE MILITARY JURISDICTION, BECAUSE TERRORISTS ALSO VIOLATE THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW WHEN THEY COMMIT CRIMES. MANY PERUVIANS WRONGFULLY THINK THAT THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE ONLY AFFECTS MEN ON ACTIVE SERVICE, LIKE THOSE PERUVIANS WHO, AFTER A SELECTION ARE SENT TO SERVE IN A MILITARY GARRISON FOR 1 OR 2 YEARS. THIS IS ONLY ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH ONE COMPLIES WITH THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE. THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW STATES IN ARTICLE 2: THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE IN AN UNAVOIDABLE DUTY OF ALL PERUVIANS WHO MUST PARTICIPATE IN NATIONAL DEFENSE BY COMPLYING WITH THEIR MILITARY OBLIGATIONS.
TST1-MUC3-0055	CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- MOREOVER, THE CONSERVATIVE INTER-AMERICAN PRESS ASSOCIATION HAS CONDEMNED CRISTIANI BECAUSE OF THE CENSORSHIP, THE DISINFORMATION NETWORK, AND THE PERSECUTION AGAINST LOCAL AND FOREIGN JOURNALISTS AND THE FEDERATION OF LATIN AMERICAN JOURNALISTS HAS JUST DONE THE SAME. THE GROUP OF EIGHT, WHICH IS THE MOST INFLUENTIAL LATIN AMERICAN GROUP, HAS CRITICIZED CRISTIANI'S REJECTION OF A CEASE-FIRE, WHICH WAS REQUESTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND INCLUDED BY THE FMLN IN ITS LATEST POLITICAL PROPOSAL. IN ADDITION, THE GROUP OF EIGHT HAS DESCRIBED CRISTIANI'S REJECTION OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS MEETING, SCHEDULED FOR MANAGUA, AS A POLITICAL OUTBOURST. CRISTIANI'S SITUATION IN THE UNITED STATES IS BECOMING DRAMATIC. THE BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS THAT SUPPORTED MILITARY AID HAS BOKEN UP. THE U.S. PRESS IS INCREASINGLY CRITICAL OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES. PROTEST DEMONSTRATIONS ARE MULTIPLYING. PERSONALITIES LIKE JESSE JACKSON ARE DEMANDING AND END TO AID FOR CRISTIANI. TO THIS MUST BE ADDED THE RECENT STATEMENT, IN SIMILAR TERMS, OF THE BISHOPS OF ALL U.S. CHURCHES. THE SCENES OF THE U.S. PERSONNEL'S DEPARTURE FROM SAN $4 BILLION TO THAT COUNTRY'S TREASURY AND 70,000 DEATHS TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. SERIOUS QUESTIONS ARE BEING RAISED NOW ABOUT BUSH'S FOREIGN POLICY. THE IMAGE OF A TERRORIST, FANATICAL FMLN WHICH SOME POWERFUL U.S. SECTORS HAD AND MOST RECENTLY IN ESCALON. THE U.S. PRESS HAS BEGUN TALKING ABOUT AN FMLN THAT SHOWS STATESMANSHIP IN ITS ACTIONS AND AS A RATIONAL AND SENSIBLE POLITICAL AND MILITARY FORCE WITH WHICH RELATIONS OF EQUALITY AND RESPECT CAN BE ESTABLISHED TO FIND POLITICAL SOLUTIONS AND TO AVOID A REGIONALIZATION AND DEEPENING OF THE CONFLICT. TO ACHIEVE DEMOCRATIZATION, TO ENFORCE RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, THERE HAD TO BE AND WE HAVE SUCCEEDED. THIS IS THE FIRST IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENT, WHICH ADDS TO THE MANY GAINS DURING THE NATIONWIDE OFFENSIVE FOR PEACE AGAINST THOSE WHO HAVE TURNED WAR INTO A BUSINESS. WE ACHIEVED IN 10 DAYS WHAT THE WORLD TOOK 10 DAYS TO UNDERSTAND. SALVADORANS, WE ARE STRONGER NOW THAN EVER. THE OFFENSIVE CONTINUES BUILDING VICTORY.
TST1-MUC3-0056	SAN SALVADOR, 2 MAY 90 -- AT LEAST 18 CASUALTIES, AMONG BOTH SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS, RESULTED FROM SEVERAL GUERRILLA ATTACKS ON THE PRESIDENT'S RESIDENCE, THE CENTRAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL, AND OTHER MILITARY INSTALLATIONS IN SAN SALVADOR AND SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE REPORTED THAT FOUR ARMY MEMBERS, INCLUDING TWO OFFICERS, WERE KILLED AND SIX SOLDIERS WERE WOUNDED IN CLASHES IN THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR. THE TWO DEAD OFFICERS WERE IDENTIFIED AS CAPTAIN JOSE ALFONSO CHAVEZ AND LIEUTENANT BOLANOS OF THE TREASURY POLICE. A TREASURY POLICE MEMBER WAS KILLED IN A REBEL ATTACK IN SAN MIGUEL, THE COUNTRY'S THIRD LARGEST CITY, EARLY THIS MORNING. THE ATTACKS BEGAN AT 2100 ON 1 MAY AND CONTINUED AFTER MIDNIGHT, ALARMING CITIZENS IN SAN SALVADOR AND CAUSING BLACKOUTS. FURTHERMORE, THE SALVADORAN RED CROSS REPORTED THAT EIGHT MINORS WERE WOUNDED IN TWO CLASHES BETWEEN GUERRILLA FORCES AND SOLDIERS IN ILOBASCO, CABANAS DEPARTMENT, AND USULUTAN, LOCATED IN THE SOUTHEAST AREA OF THE COUNTRY. MILITARY SPOKESMEN SAID THAT THE GUERRILLA FORCES ATTACKED THE PRESIDENTIAL RESIDENCE, THE SHERATON HOTEL'S SECURITY CORPS, PUBLIC WORKS MINISTER MAURICIO STUBIG'S RESIDENCE, AND THE CENTRAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL. THE COPREFA REPORTED THAT THERE WAS PROPERTY DAMAGE BUT NO CASUALTIES IN THESE PLACES. MILITARY REPORTS ADDED THAT A CIVIL DEFENSE MEMBER WAS WOUNDED IN A REBEL HARASSMENT OF THE CIVIL DEFENSE GROUP IN THE TOWN OF YUCUAYQUIN, EASTERN MORAZAN DEPARTMENT. ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY SOURCES, THE TOWNS OF JOCORO AND GUADALUPE WERE ALSO ATTACKED BY THE REBELS, BUT THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES REPORTED IN THESE ATTACKS.
TST1-MUC3-0057	SAN SALVADOR, 2 JAN 90 -- PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI DENIED THAT THERE IS DIVISION IN THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES AND SAID THE CHANGES ANNOUNCED 2 DAYS AGO WERE "ROUTINE." ON 31 DECEMBER, THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES PUBLISHED AN ORDER ANNOUNCING THAT AIR FORCE GEN RAFAEL BUSTILLO, ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL "HARDLINE" OFFICERS IN ITS COMMAND STAFF, HAD BEEN DISCHARGED. BESIDES BUSTILLO, WHO WILL BE REPLACED THIS WEEK BY GEN RAFAEL VILLAMARIONA, OTHER MINOR CHANGES AT SEVERAL MILITARY GARRISONS WERE ANNOUNCED. DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE, CRISTIANI REFUSED TO COMMENT ON GEN BUSTILLO'S STATEMENTS, WHO THIS WEEK WARNED THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES "NOT TO BE TRICKED BY GUERRILLA LEADERS" WHO WANTED TO ATTAIN A QUOTA OF POWER THROUGH THE DIALOGUE. BUSTILLO, WHO BECAME CHIEF OF THE AIR FORCE AFTER A COUP D'ETAT UNSEATED PRESIDENT CARLOS HUMBERTO ROMERO ON 15 OCTOBER 1979, ALSO ACCUSED SAN SALVADOR ARCHBISHOP ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS AND AUXILIARY BISHOP GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ OF BEING "BAD RELIGIOUS OFFICIALS" AND PLAYING INTO THE HANDS OF THE GUERRILLAS. THERE ARE COMMENTARIES CIRCULATING IN POLITICAL CIRCLES ABOUT A "CLEAR DIVISION" AMONG HARDLINE MILITARY OFFICERS OF THE ARMED FORCES, WHO ARE PART OF THE LA TANDONA GROUP. THESE OFFICER ARE AGAINST REACHING A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT AND TALKS WITH THE REBELS. OBSERVERS AGREE THAT GEN BUSTILLO'S DISCHARGE WAS PROMPTED BY THE AIR FORCE BOMBING OF LOW-INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR DURING THE RECENT GENERAL OFFENSIVE BY THE FMLN . THESE STATEMENTS WERE DENIED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI WHO INSISTED THAT BUSTILLO'S DISCHARGE WAS SIMPLY A ROUTINE MOVE WITHIN THE MILITARY INSTITUTION.
TST1-MUC3-0058	SAN SALVADOR, 15 OCT 89 -- ACCORDING TO SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, THE GOVERNMENT HAS RECEIVED REPORTS, WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS DISTURBING, THAT THE REBELS ARE PLANNING TO UNLEASH AN OFFENSIVE IN THE CAPITAL CITY ON THE VERY DAY WHEN PEACE TALKS ARE SCHEDULED TO BEGIN IN COSTA RICA. GOVERNMENT REPORTS SUGGEST THAT THE INSURGENTS WILL NOT ONLY STEP UP THEIR ACTIONS TO DESTROY THE ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND MURDER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, BUT ALSO THREATEN TO USE GROUND-TO-AIR MISSILES AGAINST THE CITY. ALTHOUGH THE PEACE PROCESS IS UNDER WAY, WE HAVE RECEIVED REPORTS THAT THE FMLN COMMAND HAS AUTHORIZED A PLAN TO STEP UP VIOLENCE IN SAN SALVADOR THROUGH THE USE OF GROUND-TO-AIR MISSILES. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS SHOWS ABSOLUTELY NO WILLINGNESS TO BRING ABOUT PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY. THE MEDIA SHOULD REVEAL TO ALL SALVADORANS AND THE ENTIRE WORLD WHAT THE FMLN IS PLANNING TO DO. ACCORDING TO THE PRESIDENT, THESE FMLN PLANS DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE PEACE PROCESS THAT BEGAN IN SEPTEMBER IN MEXICO. WHEN ASKED WHETHER THESE ACTIONS PLANNED BY THE FMLN COULD HARM THE TALKS IN COSTA RICA, CRISTIANI SAID THAT THIS WILL DEPEND ON THE SITUATION THAT PREVAILS AT THE MEETING. HE ADDED THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT OPPOSES THE USE OF THE TALKS FOR TACTICAL PURPOSES. IF THE FMLN WANTS TO USE THE PROCESS FOR TACTICAL PURPOSES, WE WILL NOT LEND OURSELVES TO THEIR GAME. OUR OBJECTIVE HAS BEEN TO SEEK PEACE IN GOOD WILL. HOWEVER, I REPEAT, WE WILL NOT LEND OURSELVES TO A FMLN TACTICAL GAME. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE CAN MAKE ANY PREDICTIONS AT THIS MOMENT. THE OUTCOME WILL DEPEND ON THESE ALLEGED PLANS AND DEVELOPMENTS IN COSTA RICA. AN END TO THE HOSTILITIES WILL BE DISCUSSED IN THIS ROUND OF TALKS. THUS, THIS MEETING COULD BE CRUCIAL FOR ACHIEVING NATIONAL PEACE. CRISTIANI MAINTAINED THAT THIS MEETING WILL BE USEFUL TO GAUGE THE INTENTIONS OF THE GUERRILLA FRONT. WE WILL PRESENT A GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL. IT IS AN BROAD PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT DEALS WITH VARIOUS ISSUES, EVEN THE POSSIBLE INCORPORATION OF THE FMLN TO CIVILIAN AND DEMOCRATIC LIFE. IT SPECIFICALLY DEALS WITH AN END TO THE HOSTILITIES, A TOPIC THAT WE HAD AGREED TO ADDRESS IN COSTA RICA DURING OUR MEETING IN MEXICO. WE ARE WILLING TO DISCUSS ANY TOPIC THAT IS WITHIN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE SAKE OF DEMOCRACY. THE PRESIDENT DESCRIBED AS BENEFICIAL THE UN AND OAS PRESENCE AT THE TALKS, BECAUSE THEY WILL GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED IN COSTA RICA. ONLY A DAY BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN, THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT DESPITE AN INCREASE IN WAR ACTIONS, THE MEETING IN COSTA RICA WILL NOT FACE OBSTACLES.
TST1-MUC3-0059	SAN SALVADOR, 9 JUN 89 -- PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI HOLDS THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF DR JOSE ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH AND CALLED THE ATTACK AN ATTEMPT TO HINDER DIALOGUE. THE PRESIDENT HAS ORDERED 3 DAYS OF NATIONAL MOURNING IN HONOR OF THE SLAIN MINISTER. WE ARE GOING TO RESPOND LEGALLY. WE WILL IMMEDIATELY BEGIN THE REQUISITE EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATIONS TO FIND AND PUNISH THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR A CRIME AGAINST THE LIFE OF AN EXEMPLARY CITIZEN. PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BLAMED THE FMLN FOR MINISTER RODRIGUEZ PORTH'S DEATH. HE SAID THIS ATTACK IS PART OF A SERIES OF ACTIONS AIMED AT DESTABILIZING THE NEW GOVERNMENT. WE ARE VIRTUALLY CONVINCED THAT THIS WAS AN FMLN EFFORT, AN FMLN INCIDENT, TO TRY AND PROVOKE A REACTION FROM OUR GOVERNMENT. WE FEEL THAT THE INVESTIGATIONS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY SHOW US WHO IS TO BLAME FOR THIS REGRETTABLE INCIDENT; HOWEVER, I REPEAT WE ARE ALMOST SURE THAT THIS WAS DONE BY THE FMLN. WE HAD HOPED THE FMLN WOULD REFRAIN FROM THIS TYPE OF BARBARIC ACTION; HOWEVER, IT IS THE DUTY OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THE SECURITY CORPS TO OFFER PROTECTION. THIS IS WHY THEY HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED: TO OFFER GREATER SAFETY AND PROTECTION TO THE PEOPLE. DURING THIS EVENING'S RADIO VENCEREMOS NEWSCAST, HOWEVER, THE REBELS NEITHER CLAIMED NOR DENIED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK. NEVERTHELESS, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI SAID THE ASSASSINATION MAY HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN IN AN ATTEMPT TO HINDER THE DIALOGUE. WE HAD LEARNED, EVEN BEFORE THE INAUGURATION, THAT THE FMLN WOULD TRY TO HINDER THE TRANSITION FROM ONE GOVERNMENT TO ANOTHER AND LATER CREATE ANARCHIC SITUATIONS FOR THE NEW GOVERNMENT. THIS COULD BE PART OF THAT PLAN. I ALSO FEEL THAT THIS COULD BE THE FMLN'S WAY TO FORCE US TO SIT DOWN AND TALK. IT WOULD BE REGRETTABLE THAT AFTER RECEIVING A FORMAL OFFER TO SIT DOWN TO TALK -- FIRST ABOUT THE MECHANISMS TO BE USED AS GUIDELINES DURING THE TALKS AND LATER TO BROACH THE MAIN ISSUES IN AN ATTEMPT TO REACH A LASTING PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY -- THE FMLN SHOULD STILL THINK THAT SUCH ACTIONS ARE NECESSARY. I THINK THEY ARE ONLY TRYING TO DISRUPT THE NEW GOVERNMENT'S WORK. DURING THIS EVENING'S NEWS CONFERENCE, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI SAID THAT DURING TODAY'S CABINET MEETING IT WAS DECIDED TO ASK THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY TO DECREE 3 DAYS OF MOURNING FOR DR RODRIGUEZ PORTH.
TST1-MUC3-0060	BOGOTA, 27 MAY 90 -- THIS IS A NIGHT OF HAPPINESS FOR ALL OF MY FAMILY, FOR ALL OF THOSE WHO WITH THEIR DEDICATION AND THEIR WORK HAVE ACCOMPANIED ME IN THIS DIFFICULT MOMENT OF COLOMBIAN LIFE. I HAVE, DEEP IN MY THOUGHTS, MY CAMPAIGN COMPANIONS, MY DEBATE LEADERS, ALL THOSE WHO FILLED EVERY MOMENT WITH DEDICATION AND ENTHUSIASM, WHICH I HOPE TO DESERVE. I HAVE PRESENT THE UNIVERSITY YOUTH, STAUNCH STANDARD-BEARERS OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY ; ALL OF MY PARTY LEADERS, SERVANTS OF THE LIBERAL CAUSE WHO SHOWED STEADFAST LOYALTY; GRASSROOTS LEADERS FROM ALL PARTS OF COLOMBIA; AND THE PEOPLE, WHOSE DECISION COMMITS ME BEYOND ANY DOUBT. I WANT TO OFFER THIS VICTORY TO GLORIA, JUAN MANUEL, AND HIS BROTHERS , AND TO LUIS CARLOS GALAN'S PARENTS -- MARIO AND CECILIA -- WHO ACCOMPANIED HIM IN HIS LONG HEROIC JOURNEY THROUGH COLOMBIAN LIFE. THIS IS HIS VICTORY, A VICTORY FOR HIS CHILDREN, HIS IDEALS, HIS FAITH IN COLOMBIA, AND THE LIBERAL PRINCIPLES THAT INSPIRED HIS LIFE. I ALSO THINK OF MY MOTHER; MY BROTHERS; ANA MILENA , MY WIFE AND COMPANION AT ALL TIMES AND DURING SLEEPLESS NIGHTS; AND MY CHILDREN SIMON AND MARIA PAZ. TODAY COLOMBIA HAS COMPLETED THE MOST DIFFICULT AND RUGGED POLITICAL CAMPAIGN IN ALL ITS HISTORY. ITS VALUES, ITS DEMOCRACY, AND ITS LIBERTY WERE AT STAKE AS NEVER BEFORE. AS NEVER BEFORE, THE PROMOTERS OF VIOLENCE FROM ALL SIDES TRIED TO DESTABILIZE OUR INSTITUTIONS. HOWEVER, COLOMBIANS, ALSO AS NEVER BEFORE, STOOD UP TO THE HISTORIC MOMENT WE FACED. THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE'S POWERFUL DEMOCRATIC DETERMINATION WAS STRONGER. CONVINCED OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CURRENT HOUR, THEY WENT OUT TO SUPPORT WITH MILLIONS OF VOTES DEMOCRACY THAT HAS HAD TO FACE BOMBS, NARCOTERRORISM, AND HATEFUL PRACTICES. ALL THOSE WHO HAVE WANTED TO THREATEN OUR DEMOCRACY MUST LISTEN: OUR PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN TODAY WITH COURAGE AND CLARITY. WE SHALL PREVAIL. IT HAS BEEN A CONSCIENTIOUS, BOLD MOBILIZATION BY MILLIONS OF COLOMBIANS WHO HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR POLITICAL WILL FOR THE FIRST TIME THROUGH A SYSTEM WITHOUT PRESSURE OR INTIMIDATION. ONCE AGAIN, TODAY, AS ON 11 MARCH, CITIZENS VOTED AS THEY WISHED. THIS DIFFICULT AND RUGGED CAMPAIGN HAS NOT BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY A CRUDE CONFRONTATION AMONG CANDIDATES, WHO ACTED WITH DECENCY AND LOYALTY.
TST1-MUC3-0061	BOGOTA, 25 OCT 89 -- GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA ALIAS "THE MEXICAN," A WELL-KNOWN COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKER WHO IS ONE OF THE DRUG LORDS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL HAS ADMITTED THAT HE IS IN FAVOR OF "CEASING OFFENSIVE ACTIONS AGAINST THE MILITARY FORCES." IN A LETTER TO THE OPPOSITION'S DAILY LA PRENSA EDITED IN BOGOTA, HE STRESSED THAT "THE MISSION EACH ONE OF US HAS AS COLOMBIAN CITIZENS IS TRYING TO RESTORE PEACE IN COLOMBIA." RODRIGUEZ GACHA, WHO ALONG WITH PABLO ESCOBAR HAVE BECOME THE COUNTRY'S MOST WANTED MEN, DENIED HAVING PROPOSED AN ALLIANCE WITH THE COMMUNIST GUERRILLAS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA . ONLY 1 WEEK AGO, LA PRENSA REPORTED THAT RODRIGUEZ GACHA HAD PROPOSED AN ALLIANCE WITH THE FARC IN ORDER TO FACE THE WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING DECLARED BY LIBERAL PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO IN MID-AUGUST. "THE TRUTH IS THAT THERE IS NO SUCH LETTER," SAID THE "CAPO" FOR WHOSE HEAD -- ALONG WITH PABLO ESCOBAR -- COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE OFFERED A REWARD OF 100 MILLION PESOS . RODRIGUEZ GACHA ALSO RECALLED HIS STRUGGLE AGAINST THE FARC. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE OCCASION, THE DRUG TRAFFICKER REJECTED ALL INFORMATION THAT STATING THAT HE IS THE "ACKNOWLEDGED PERPETRATOR OF ALL CRIMES AGAINST PATRIOTIC UNION LEADERS ." HE ADDED THAT ALTHOUGH HE WAS CHARGED WITH THE MURDER OF JAIME PARDO LEAL "THE COURT'S VERDICT WAS FAVORABLE TO ME." PARDO LEAL WAS THE FOUNDER AND FIRST PRESIDENT OF UP. UP WAS FORMED IN 1984, DURING A TRUCE SIGNED BETWEEN FARC AND THE THEN SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE PRESIDENT BELISARIO BETANCUR. ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, PARDO LEAL WAS MURDERED BY TWO PAID ASSASSINS WHO RECEIVED ORDERS FROM "EL MEXICANO" ON 11 OCTOBER 1987. RODRIGUEZ GACHA ARGUED: "NOBODY HAS BEEN CHASED WITH SUCH FIERCENESS IN COLOMBIA BEFORE AS I HAVE." HE ADDED: "IT SEEMS THAT ALL THE ARTICLES OF THE PENAL CODE HAVE BEEN THROWN AT ME AND MY DETRACTORS ARE NOT BINDED BY ANY OF THESE NORMS." AFTER HE INSISTED THAT OFFENSIVES AGAINST THE COLOMBIAN ARMED FORCES SHOULD STOP, RODRIGUEZ GACHA NOTED THAT THOSE WHO DISTURB PUBLIC ORDER "SHOULD DEFINITELY STOP USING WEAPONS." "THESE ARE THE FIRST STEPS THAT ARE NEEDED TO GET COLOMBIANS TO SIT AT A NEGOTIATING TABLE WITHOUT EXCLUDING ANYONE," HE CONCLUDED. VIRGILIO BARCO'S GOVERNMENT HAS REJECTED ALL POSSIBILITY OF DIALOGUE WITH THE DRUG MAFIAS.
TST1-MUC3-0062	BOGOTA, 1 FEB 89 -- THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION HAS ANNOUNCED IN A COMMUNIQUE SENT TO ANTONIO ROLDAN BETANCUR, GOVERNOR OF THE NORTHWESTERN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, THAT IT REJECTS THE PEACE PLAN PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT IT WILL CONTINUE ARMED ATTACKS, IT WAS LEARNED A FEW HOURS AGO. ACCORDING TO INITIAL REPORTS, THE ARMED MOVEMENT--THE MOST RADICAL OF THE GUERRILLA GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY--SENT THE MESSAGE THROUGH LUIS MESA PUERTA, A POLICE INSPECTOR OF EL TIGRE, WHO WAS KIDNAPED LAST FRIDAY FOR THIS PURPOSE. ROLDAN BETANCUR DID NOT DISCLOSE ANY MORE DETAILS AND MERELY CONFIRMED THAT THE CASTROITE ELN, WHICH HAS STAGED SEVERAL DYNAMITE ATTACKS AGAINST OIL INSTALLATIONS, DID NOT ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL MADE BY PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS' GOVERNMENT. MEANWHILE, THE M-19 SENT A LETTER A FEW HOURS AGO TO MISAEL PASTRANA BORRERO, A FORMER PRESIDENT AND MEMBER OF THE OPPOSITION SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE PARTY , REQUESTING THAT HIS PARTY ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN A NEW PEACE INITIATIVE THAT FORMALLY BEGAN THE 2D WEEK OF JANUARY. AT THAT TIME, ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT, RAFAEL PARDO RUEDA--THE PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER FOR PEACE--AND THE TOP M-19 COMMANDER, CARLOS PIZARRO LEON GOMEZ, SIGNED A PRELIMINARY AGREEMENT THAT CONTEMPLATES THE BEGINNING OF A DIRECT DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GUERRILLA GROUPS AND SPOKESMEN OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES REPRESENTED IN PARLIAMENT. HOWEVER, THE FARC, WHICH DECLARED A UNILATERAL TRUCE TO FACILIATE THE BEGINNING OF THE CONVERSATIONS, SAID THAT THESE AGREEMENTS WERE "EXCLUSIVE," AS THEY WERE SIGNED BY ONLY ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S REBEL MOVEMENTS. THE DOCUMENT SIGNED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE M-19 SPECIFIES THAT THE TASKS WITH ALL THE REBEL ORGANIZATIONS ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH THE SIMON BOLIVAR NATIONAL GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD . HOWEVER, WITH THE ELN ANNOUNCEMENT, A JOINT AGREEMENT HAS BEEN RULED OUT. MEANWHILE, PRIOR TO LEAVING TODAY FOR CARACAS WHERE HE WILL ATTEND THE INAUGURATION OF CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, THE PRESIDENT HELD A MEETING WITH THE CHIEFS OF THE TWO TRADITIONAL PARTIES, FORMER PRESIDENTS JULIO CESAR TURBAY OF THE RULING LIBERAL PARTY, AND PASTRANA BORRERO, OF THE PSC. THE MEETING HELD AT THE NARINO PALACE WAS CALLED SO THAT BARCO VARGAS COULD REPORT TO THE PSC ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MOST RECENT EVENTS CONCERNING THE NEW PEACE PROCESS THAT BEGAN WITH THE M-19. ACCORDING TO SOME POLITICAL CIRCLES, IN THIS MANNER THE PATH TOWARD PEACE MIGHT BE CLEARED, INASMUCH AS ONE OF THE "RESERVATIONS" THE PSC HAD WAS THAT THE BARCO VARGAS GOVERNMENT DID NOT CONSULT WITH THE PARTIES ON THE NEGOTIATIONS.
TST1-MUC3-0063	PANAMA CITY , 14 MAR 90 -- AS FAR AS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INVESTIGATE, U.S. SOUTHERN COMMAND TROOPS IN PANAMA ARE GUARDING THE VERACRUZ AREA TO PREVENT CRIMINALS FROM LEAVING. BY DOING THIS THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ARREST AT ANY TIME THE FOLLOWERS OF GENERAL NORIEGA, CURRENTLY UNDER ARREST IN FLORIDA ON DRUG TRAFFICKING CHARGES. A CITIZEN BY THE NAME OF CUETO, WHO IS FRIGHTENED BY THE CRIME IN VERACRUZ, SAID THAT "ONE OF THESE DRUG DEALERS DISTRIBUTED A LEAFLET ON THE NIGHT OF 11 MARCH THAT WARNED THE POPULATION THAT ANYONE WHO REPORTS THE MEMBERS OF THE PRO-NORIEGA BAND, LIVING IN VERACRUZ, TO THE AUTHORITIES WILL DIE IMMEDIATELY WITH THEIR TONGUES HANGING LIKE A TIE. THE LEAFLET ADDS THAT IN A FEW DAYS THE BAND WILL PLACE BOMBS NEAR HOWARD AIR FORCE BASE TO AVENGE THE ARREST OF THEIR CRONIES IN THE CURUNDU NEIGHBORHOOD." FINALLY, EL SIGLO HAS LEARNED THAT THE CRIMINALS AND DRUG DEALERS WHO HAVE INVADED VERACRUZ HAVE SMALL CANOES AND SMALL MOTOR BOATS WITH WHICH THEY TRAVEL TO THE CAPITAL POSING AS FISHERMEN. IN THESE SMALL BOATS, THEY TRANSPORT THE DRUGS THAT THEY WILL SELL DURING THE WEEK IN PANAMA CITY; THIS DRUGS ARE STORED IN DIFFERENT HOUSES IN VERACRUZ. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT MOST OF THESE CRIMINALS BELONG TO THE CODEPADI AND THE DIGNITY BATTALIONS, AND AS FAR AS WE COULD DETERMINE, THEY ARE STILL RECEIVING SUPPORT FROM PEOPLE WHO THRIVED DURING THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT AND WHO ARE CONTINUING TO STRUGGLE FOR NORIEGA'S RETURN.
TST1-MUC3-0064	MANAGUA , NO DATE -- IN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT THERE ARE ALSO CRIMINALS LIKE VICE PRESIDENT MERINO, A MAN WHO HAS PERSONALLY PARTICIPATED IN CRIMES AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AGAINST THE SALVADORAN . THERE IS ALSO D'AUBUISSON, WHO IS ANOTHER ASSASSIN WHO HAS PARTICIPATED IN CRIMES AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. NICARAGUA IS GOING TO DEMAND PUNISHMENT FOR THE ASSASSINS OF PRIESTS AND OF SALVADORAN PEOPLE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. IT WILL DEMAND THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BREAK RELATIONS WITH EL SALVADOR AND THAT IT TAKE MEASURES AGAINST THAT CRIMINAL GOVERNMENT UNTIL IT STOPS THE BOMBINGS AND THE CRIMES AND IT PUNISHES THE CRIMINALS. WHAT WE ARE INTERESTED IN IS PEACE AND DEMOCRACY, BUT NOT THE PEACE OF GRAVEYARDS. THERE IS PEACE IN CEMETERIES . THAT IS THE PEACE THEY WANT FOR EL SALVADOR, THE PEACE OF GRAVEYARDS. THEY WANT TO TURN EL SALVADOR INTO A CEMETERY. IN OTHER WORDS, . HOWEVER, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE COURAGEOUS. THEY ARE HEROIC PEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW TO FIGHT. THEY HAVE BEEN SHOWING THIS. THEY HAVE GREAT . WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE STRUGGLING IN THE INTERNATIONAL SPHERE TO ACHIEVE PEACE. IT IS NOT WE NICARAGUANS, IT IS NOT I BREAKING THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENTS. I WILL CONTINUE TO DEFEND THEM SO THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WILL ABIDE BY THEM, BECAUSE HUMAN RIGHTS MUST BE RESPECTED. ON 7 AUGUST 1987, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT SIGNED AN AGREEMENT SAYING THAT IT WAS GOING TO RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, AND IT IS NOT ABIDING BY THAT AGREEMENT. IT HAS TO COMPLY WITH THAT AGREEMENT EVEN IF IT WITHDRAWS FROM THE PEACE TALKS, EVEN IF IT DOES NOT WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEETINGS OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS. WE ARE ALSO GOING TO CONTINUE STRUGGLING IN THE INTERNATIONAL SPHERE, IN THE UNITED NATIONS, SO THAT AN AGREEMENT WILL BE REACHED TO COMPLY WITH THE REMOVAL OF THE CONTRAS FROM HONDURAS. IF THE CONTRAS DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE HONDURAS, WELL, WHAT HAS BEEN SHOWN ON THIS BORDER, IN THESE HEROIC TOWNS OF , VILLANUEVA, SOMOTILLO, , SAN PEDRO, SAN BENITO, SAN FRANCISCO, AND SANTO TOMAS? ALL THOSE NAMES ARE KNOWN IN THE WORLD FOR THE HEROIC BATTLES WHICH HAVE BEEN WAGED THERE TO REJECT THE COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES WHO HAVE RECEIVED ALL TYPES OF SUPPORT FROM THE YANKEES. THE YANKEES HAVE GIVEN THE CONTRAS ALL TYPES OF ARMAMENTS, INCLUDING MORE THAN 300 SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES. WE ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE PEACE BECAUSE THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE WANT PEACE. THE TOWNS IN NORTHERN NICARAGUA WANT PEACE. THEY WANT PEACE. DO YOU WANT PEACE? OR DO YOU WANT WAR? DO YOU WANT PEACE? WE ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE PEACE. WE ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE TOTAL PEACE BY ALWAYS VIGOROUSLY FIGHTING THE COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES AND DEFEATING THE YANKEES IN THE ELECTIONS ON 25 FEBRUARY 1990. WE ARE GOING TO THROW SHOVELFULS OF DIRT AT THE CONTRAS AND THE YANKEES ON 25 FEBRUARY 1990, BECAUSE THE YANKEES HAVE CREATED WHAT IS CALLED THE UNO. IT IS A MIXTURE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE . IT IS A SALAD BUT WITH ROTTEN FRUIT. IT IS A SALAD WITH ROTTEN FRUIT. WHO CAN EAT A SALAD WITH ROTTEN FRUIT? CAN YOU BE DECEIVED ? THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SHOW ON 25 FEBRUARY THEIR DESIRE FOR PEACE AND DEMOCRACY AND THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE PLANS OF THE REVOLUTION. THESE ARE GOING TO BE ELECTIONS BETWEEN NICARAGUA AND THE YANKEES. THE CANDIDATES ARE GOING TO BE BUSH ON THE ONE SIDE AND DANIEL ON THE OTHER. THOSE ARE THE CANDIDATES. WHO ARE THE PEOPLE GOING TO VOTE FOR? ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE FOR BUSH? THOSE OTHER ONES, THE ONES GOING AROUND THERE, THEY DO NOT REPRESENT ANYTHING. BUSH IS PAYING THOSE PEOPLE TO BE PRETENDING . THE REAL ENEMY HERE IS THE YANKEES WHO HAVE ORGANIZED AND FINANCED THE UNO. THE YANKEES CANNOT SOLVE THE NICARAGUAN PROBLEMS, BECAUSE THEY CANNOT EVEN SOLVE HONDURAS' PROBLEM. THEY CANNOT SOLVE ITS ECONOMIC PROBLEM, EVEN THOUGH THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT HAS LENT ITSELF FOR THE YANKEE MANEUVERING. I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT THE HONDURAN PEOPLE. YOU KNOW THAT THE HONDURAN PEOPLE ARE COMBATIVE AND BRAVE. WHAT IS THE ARMY USED FOR IN HONDURAS? WHAT IS IT USED FOR? TO MASSACRE THE PEOPLE . THE CONTRAS ARE IN HONDURAN TERRITORY. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING THOSE CONTRAS OUT? IT IS UP TO THE HONDURANS, IT IS UP TO THE HONDURAN ARMY.
TST1-MUC3-0065	ROME , 28 APR 89 -- THE ROME FOREIGN MINISTRY ON FRIDAY CONFIRMED THAT TWO ITALIAN ENGINEERS AND A SPANISH TECHNICIAN WERE KIDNAPPED THURSDAY IN COLOMBIA FROM A CONSTRUCTION SITE SOME THIRTY KILOMETERS FROM THE CITY OF MEDELLIN. THE TWO ITALIANS, ROBERTO ROASCIO OF MILAN AND MARIO ACCURSO OF ROME, TOGETHER WITH SPANIARD FRANCISCO PUJA, WERE TAKEN HOSTAGE FROM THE WORK SITE WHERE THE MILANESE FIRM "TORNO" IS COLLABORATING IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A HYDRO-ELECTRIC PLANT BEING FINANCED BY THE WORLD BANK. THE FOREIGN MINISTRY ADDED THAT IT WAS IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH ROME'S AMBASSADOR TO BOGOTA', FILIPPO ANFUSO, AND THAT THE EMBASSY'S STAFF WAS WORKING WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO ASCERTAIN THE DYNAMICS OF THE KIDNAPPING AND WHO MAY HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE. THE FAMILIES OF THE ITALIAN ENGINEERS, IT WAS LEARNED HERE, HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT.
TST1-MUC3-0066	MAPUTO , NO DATE -- THE FRELIMO PARTY APPRECIATES AND SUPPORTS EFFORTS MOUNTED BY THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT AND OTHER STATES OF CENTRAL AMERICA TO RESTORE PEACE, AND CALLS ON ALL THE INTERESTED FORCES TO CREATE CONDITIONS TO APPLY THE PEACE PLAN AS AGREED UPON. WE VALUE OUR RELATIONS OF FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION WITH THE SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT. IN THE REPUBLIC OF CUBA, THE PEOPLE'S POWER HAS CONSOLIDATED AND THE REVOLUTION CAN NOW FUNDAMENTALLY CONCENTRATE ITS EFFORTS ON THE TECHNICAL AND SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY AND THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THE PEOPLE. THE PARTY SALUTES THE RELATIONS OF FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION BETWEEN OUR PARTIES, STATES, AND PEOPLES, AND EXPRESSES THE HOPE THAT THESE RELATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP FURTHER. THE PARTY HOPES THAT THE WINDS OF PEACE NOW BLOWING WILL CONTRIBUTE TO ELIMINATING THE HOTBEDS OF TENSION THROUGHOUT ALL OF CENTRAL AMERICA AND LATIN AMERICA IN GENERAL SO THAT THE PEOPLE OF THAT ZONE MAY BENEFIT FROM PEACE AND TRANQUILITY TO UNDERTAKE THE NECESSARY FIGHT AGAINST MISERY AND BACKWARDNESS. IN EUROPE, DURING THE PERIOD UNDER EXAMINATION, THE RELATIONS OF FRIENDSHIP AND SOLIDARITY WITH OUR PEOPLE WERE DEEPENED, WHILE THE COOPERATION OF THE MOZAMBICAN STATE WITH THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WAS BROADENED. IN GENERAL TERMS, WE HAVE BEEN CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE PROCESS TO ESTABLISH THE EUROPE OF 12 AND THE TRANSFORMATIONS BEGUN IN VARIOUS SOCIALIST COUNTRIES. THE PARTY VIEWS POSITIVELY THE CONTINUATION OF THE PROCESS OF CONSOLIDATION OF THE EUROPE OF 12 AND HOPES THAT THIS PROCESS WILL POSITIVELY CONTRIBUTE TO BALANCED RELATIONS BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH. THE PARTY SALUTES THE COURAGE DEMONSTRATED BY THE CPSU LEADERSHIP, PARTICULARLY COMRADE MIKHAIL GORBACHEV, BY FACING THE GREAT CHALLENGE OF CRITICAL REFLECTION AND FOR THE RECTIFICATIONS NOW IN PROGRESS IN THE USSR. THE TRANSFORMATIONS TAKING PLACE IN VARIOUS SOCIALIST COUNTRIES OPEN AN ENCOURAGING AND PROFITABLE THEORETICAL DEBATE ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF SOCIALISM THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE CONTINUE IN A CLIMATE OF UNITY AND SOLIDARITY. THE PARTY IS FOLLOWING THIS PERIOD OF REFLECTION ON THE PROCESS OF THE BUILDING OF SOCIALISM IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND IT IS OVERJOYED BY THE FACT THAT THIS PROCESS CONTINUES TO SAFEGUARD COOPERATION WITH OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE AWARE THAT THESE CHANGES TAKING PLACE IN SOCIALIST COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY THE CHANGES THAT ARE OBSERVED IN THE USSR WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF PERESTROYKA AND GLASNOST, HAVE AN IMPORTANT IMPACT AT THE LEVEL OF THE PARTIES AND THE PROGRESSIVE FORCES, AS WELL AS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS IN GENERAL. THIS IMPACT HAS BEEN VERY POSITIVE AND HAS DECISIVELY CONTRIBUTED TO CREATE A NEW ATMOSPHERE IN RELATIONS AMONG THE SUPERPOWERS AND IN THE PROCESS OF DETENTE THAT CURRENTLY CHARACTERIZES THE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.
TST1-MUC3-0067	NO CITY , 20 OCT 89 -- AND WHAT DO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS MEAN WITH THAT VERY CATEGORICAL PASSAGE? THEY WANT TO SAY THAT IT IS THE FMLN THAT MUST STOP ITS HOSTILITIES, AND DO SO AT ONCE, IMMEDIATELY, AND EFFECTIVELY IN ORDER TO HOLD A DIALOGUE. WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT THE PRESIDENTS, AS ANY RATIONAL PEOPLE, FEEL IT IS MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TO CONDUCT A PROCESS OF DIALOGUE WITHOUT BOMBS AND BULLETS. WHAT ELSE DOES THE AGREEMENT SAY? IT SAYS THE END OF HOSTILITIES WILL PERMIT A DIALOGUE SO THAT THE FMLN WILL LATER ABANDON THE ARMED STRUGGLE, DISBAND AS AN ARMED GROUP, SURRENDER ITS WEAPONS, AND JOIN DEMOCRATIC AND INSTITUTIONAL LIFE. BY THIS, THEY -- EVEN NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA WHO SIGNED THE AGREEMENT -- MEAN THERE IS INSTITUTIONAL LIFE IN EL SALVADOR AND DEMOCRACY, WHICH THEY ARE ASKING THE FMLN TO JOIN. THIS IS THE SPIRIT OF THE PROPOSAL THE GOVERNMENT TOOK TO SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA. BECAUSE THE PROPOSAL WE ADOPTED IS SO LONG, IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO READ IT TO YOU, SO THAT YOU CAN BE INFORMED. HOWEVER, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE FOR YOURSELVES TOMORROW WHAT I AM SAYING TO YOU TONIGHT, BECAUSE THE PROPOSAL WILL BE PUBLISHED IN ALL OF OUR COUNTRY'S NEWSPAPERS. THERE, YOU WILL SEE THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS FAITHFULLY COMPLYING WITH WHAT THE FIVE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS SIGNED IN THE TELA ACCORD, AND THAT WE ARE FOLLOWING UP ON THE TERMS OF THE FIRST DIALOGUE IN MEXICO. WHAT DOES THE FMLN DO IN SAN JOSE? FIRST, DRAWING AWAY FROM THE AGREEMENT MADE IN MEXICO, IT DOES NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT CEASING HOSTILITIES. IT INTRODUCES SEVERAL PROPOSALS, WHICH THE FMLN CLAIMS ARE AN EXPANSION ON THE MEXICO PROPOSAL, AND PRESENTS SEVERAL DOCUMENTS TO THE SALVADORAN DELEGATION. BY THE WAY, THE FMLN ALSO VIOLATES THE MEXICO PACT BY NOT RESPECTING THE DISCRETION OF THE DIALOGUE PROCESS. ONCE AGAIN IT PRESENTS THESE DOCUMENTS TO THE NEWS MEDIA BEFORE PRESENTING THEM TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DELEGATION. AS YOU WILL SEE, THE DELEGATION RECEIVED QUITE A FEW DOCUMENTS FROM THE FMLN THERE.
TST1-MUC3-0068	MADRID , 19 NOV 89 -- THE BODIES OF THE SPANISH JESUITS MURDERED LAST FRIDAY BY UNIFORMED INDIVIDUALS WERE BURIED IN SAN SALVADOR TODAY. THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT HAS ASKED THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT FOR EXPLANATIONS CONCERNING THESE DEATHS. TODAY IN PARIS THE SPANISH PRIME MINISTER SAID THAT FUTURE CONFIDENCE IN THE GOVERNMENT LED BY ALFREDO CRISTIANI DEPENDS ON THE RESPONSE TO THIS REQUEST FOR AN IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION: THE GREATEST POSSIBLE EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE IMMEDIATELY TO INVESTIGATE WHAT HAPPENED REGARDING MURDERS WHICH SOME PEOPLE ARE APPARENTLY INTERPRETING IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE SPANISH, OR SPANISH CITIZENS WHO TOOK ON SALVADORAN CITIZENSHIP, BUT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT SOME OF THE CITIZENS WHO SUFFERED THIS APPALLING ATTACK, THIS MURDER, WERE SPANISH. OUR CONCERN OBVIOUSLY IS NOT EXPRESSED MERELY IN TERMS OF THIS OR THAT NATIONALITY BECAUSE THIS MURDER IS A HIDEOUS CRIME AND THUS THE MATTER MUST BE CLEARED UP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AND FURTHERMORE MUCH OF THE EFFORT OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE OF WITH REGARD TO THAT COUNTRY DEPENDS UPON IT. A SPANISH DIPLOMATIC DELEGATION HEADED BY UNDERSECRETARY FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS INOCENCIO ARIAS ATTENDED THE BURIAL OF THE JESUITS. HE PUT HIMSELF AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE SPANISH RESIDENTS IN EL SALVADOR WHO WANT TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND RETURN TO SPAIN.
TST1-MUC3-0069	HAVANA , 10 JAN 90 -- DESPITE AMPLE EVIDENCE, NO SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAD BLAMED THE ARMED FORCES OF KILLING DEFENSELESS CIVILIANS SINCE THE CIVIL WAR WORSENED IN 1979. THE ANNOUNCEMENT MADE BY PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI OF THE ARREST OF 45 SOLDIERS AND 2 OFFICERS FOR KILLING 6 CLERGYMEN, A MAID, AND HER DAUGHTER, ON 16 NOVEMBER IS IN ITSELF A SMALL AND PARTIAL MILESTONE. CRISTIANI, WHOSE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE PARTY WAS FOUNDED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTIES BY INDIVIDUALS LINKED TO PARAMILITARY BANDS, THE ARMY, AND SECURITY CORPS, ASSERTED THAT THE NAMES OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIMES WILL BE RELEASED IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS. JESUIST FRANCISCO ESTRADA, WHO REPLACED FATHER JOSE IGNACIO ELLACURIA -- ONE OF THOSE MASSACRED -- AT THE RECTORSHIP OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY IN SAN SALVADOR, WARNED THAT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO KNOW WHICH SARGENT PULLED THE TRIGGER BUT WHO GAVE HIM ORDERS TO DO SO NEEDS TO BE REVEALED. CRISTIANI WILL NOT GO THAT FAR. COSMETIC SACRIFICES ARE MADE IN ORDER TO NEUTRALIZE THE THREAT OF U.S. CONGRESS INTERRUPTING THE $1.5 MILLION IT SENDS A DAY FOR THE WAR AGAINST THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT AND THE REPRESSION OF THE PEOPLE. THE DISMISSAL OF GENERAL JUAN RAFAEL BUSTILLO AS CHIEF OF THE AIR FORCES AND THE POSSIBLE PUNISHMENT OF SOME OF THE COUNTERINSURGENT ATLACATL BATTALION FULFILL THESE REQUIREMENTS. HOWEVER, CRISTIANI WILL ATTEND THE NEXT INFORMAL SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS IN TEGUCIGALPA, HONDURAS ON 28 JANUARY UNDER ADVERSE CONDITIONS. THE MOBILIZATION OF THE LATIN AMERICAN PUBLIC OPINION AGAINST THE U.S. INTERVENTION IN PANAMA AND ITS AIM OF EXTENDING THE INTERVENTION TO OTHER NATIONS OF THE AREA HAVE WEAKENED WASHINGTON'S DIPLOMATIC SPACE. THIS COULD HAVE AN EFFECT ON ITS POLITICAL ALLY OF EL SALVADOR WHICH, IN THE PREVIOUS SUMMIT HELD IN DECEMBER, PRESENTED NICARAGUA AND THE FMLN AS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WORSENING OF THE CRISIS IN CENTRAL AMERICA. THE FACTS ARE CONCLUSIVE. WHAT WILL NOW BE THE EXCUSE OF SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND HIS PROTECTOR GEORGE BUSH?
TST1-MUC3-0070	BUENOS AIRES, 25 JAN -- THE GROUP THAT STORMED THE 3D INFANTRY REGIMENT IN LA TABLADA INTENDED TO OVERTHROW THE CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITIES AND TO IMPLEMENT "A PLAN OF GOVERNMENT" WITH ARMY FUNDS. THE GROUP ALSO SOUGHT TO DISSOLVE THE ARMED FORCES. ACCORDING TO DOCUMENTS THAT WERE SEIZED FROM THE TERRORISTS BY INTELLIGENCE SERVICES, THE ATTACKERS PLANNED TO ISSUE A PROCLAMATION. THE PROCLAMATION STATES THAT THE SO-CALLED "PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT," ALLEGEDLY TO HAVE BEEN INSTALLED BY THEM, WOULD ADOPT THE FOLLOWING MEASURES: 1. TO DECREE A 150-PERCENT SALARY INCREASE FOR ALL PEOPLE EARNING 2,000 AUSTRALES OR LESS; 2. TO DECREE A 100-PERCENT SALARY INCREASE FOR ALL PEOPLE EARNING 3,000 AUSTRALES; 3. TO DECREE A 40-PERCENT SALARY INCREASE FOR PEOPLE WHO EARN UP TO 6,000 AUSTRALES; 4. TO INCREASE MINIMUM PENSIONS TO 4,000 AUSTRALES; 5. TO ELIMINATE ALL PRIVILEGED PENSIONS FOR THE MILITARY, DEPUTIES, SENATORS, COUNCILMEN, CABINET MEMBERS, AND SECRETARIES OF STATE; 6. TO DECREE A PRICE FREEZE AND TO DECREE THAT ALL THOSE WHO VIOLATE THE ESTABLISHED PRICE FREEZE, AS WELL AS SPECULATORS AND HOARDERS, WILL BE PUNISHED WITH SENTENCES OF UP TO 20 YEARS; IT WIL BE UP TO THE PEOPLE TO CONTROL THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PRICE FREEZE; 7. TO DECREE THE IMMEDIATE SUSPENSION OF EVICTIONS AND DECREE A FREEZE ON HOUSE RENTS; 8. TO DECREASE INTEREST RATES AND NEGATIVE RATES, EVEN ON PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED CREDITS; 9. TO CANCEL IMMEDIATELY DEBTS CONTRACTED WITH THE FINANCIAL MARKET; 10. TO CANCEL DEBTS CONTRACTED BY SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED FARMERS WITH THE BANKING SECTOR; 11. TO IMPLEMENT UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE OF 2,000 AUSTRALES PER CHILD; 12. TO IMPLEMENT A SUBSIDY FOR UNWED MOTHERS OF 3,000 AUSTRALES; 13. THE PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT HEREBY NATIONALIZES THE BANKING SECTOR; THE IAPI, ARGENTINE INSTITUTE FOR PROMOTION OF FOREIGN TRADE, IS REESTABLISHED; 14. ARTICLE NO 40 OF THE 1949 CONSTITUTION IS HEREBY ESTABLISHED: "ENERGY SOURCES ARE THE INALIENABLE PROPERTY OF THE NATION." THE REST OF THE TERRORIST PROCLAMATION STATES: THIS IS A NATIONAL EMERGENCY AND SOLIDARITY PLAN THAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED FOR 120 DAYS. IT SEEKS TO PROMOTE INVESTMENTS FOR PRODUCTION, AND CONSUMPTION. WITHIN THIS 120-DAY PERIOD, THE PROPER NATIONAL SECTORS WILL HELP IN THE DRAFTING OF A SHORT-, MEDIUM-, AND LONG-TERM ECONOMIC PLAN THAT WILL PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. THE FUNDS TO FINANCE THIS NATIONAL EMERGENCY AND SOLIDARITY PLAN WILL DERIVE FROM: 1. THE ELIMINATION OF THE MILITARY BUDGET, SINCE THE ARMY HAS BEEN REPLACED BY THE POPULAR MILITIAS OF THE PEOPLE'S RESISTANCE FRONT; 2. THE EXPRESSION OF ALL THE PROPERTIES OF JOSE ALFREDO MARTINEZ DE HOZ AND OF ALL MILITARY OFFICERS WHO HAVE MORE THAN ONE HOUSE AND ONE CAR; THE SAME WILL APPLY TO ALL UNION LEADERS; 3. THE EXPROPRIATION OF THE FINANCIAL MARKET; 4. THE SUSPENSION OF INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THE FOREIGN DEBT. THIS PLAN IS BASED ON THE SOLIDARITY OF MILLIONS OF ARGENTINES, THE IMMENSE MAJORITY OF WORKERS, PRODUCERS, AND UNEMPLOYED. WE HAVE THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO LIVE IN A FATHERLAND WITH LIBERTY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE, WHERE ALL MEN ARE BROTHERS, AND WHERE THE WEALTH OF THE COUNTRY MAY BE ENJOYED BY EVERYONE IN KEEPING WITH HIS WORK, HIS CREATIVITY, AND HIS HONESTY.
TST1-MUC3-0071	LA PAZ, 25 MAY 89 -- TWO U.S. MORMON MISSIONARIES -- AGED 19 AND 21 -- WERE SHOT TO DEATH LAST NIGHT BY A GROUP OF TERRORISTS FROM THE ZARATE WILKA ARMED FORCES OF LIBERATION . THIS IS THE SAME TERRORIST GROUP THAT CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE FOILED ATTACK AGAINST FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE GEORGE SHULTZ IN AUGUST 1988. IN OCTOBER, THE GROUP BLEW UP THE LINES PROVIDING POWER TO LA PAZ, RESULTING IN A POWER OUTAGE THERE. THE GROUP ALSO CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE JANUARY DYNAMITE BOMBING IN THE CONGRESS. THE MURDER TOOK PLACE AT 2220 LAST NIGHT AND, 30 MINUTES LATER, THE TERRORISTS LEFT MESSAGES WITH LOCAL NEWSPAPERS CLAIMING TO BE THE ASSAILANTS. THE MESSAGE, WHICH WAS HANDRITTEN, SAID: "THE VIOLATION OF OUR NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY CANNOT REMAIN UNPUNISHED. THIS IS A WARNING TO THE YANKEE INVADERS WHO COME HERE TO MASSACRE OUR PEASANT BROTHERS AND TO THEIR LACKEYS. WE POOR HAVE NO OTHER OPTION BUT TO TAKE UP ARMS. OUR HATRED IS IMPLACABLE, AND OUR WAR IS TO THE DEATH. FAL, ZARATE WILKA." THE U.S. CITIZENS -- TODD RAY WILSON BURDENSON AND JEFFREY BRENT BALL -- WERE MISSIONARIES OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH OF LATTER DAY SAINTS , WHICH, IN RECENT YEARS, HAS EXTENDED ITS ACTIVITIES IN BOLIVIA BY BUILDING DOZENS OF TEMPLES. BOTH MISSIONARIES HAD LIVED IN THE VICINITY OF THE GENERAL CEMETERY LOCATED IN A DENSELY POPULATED LA PAZ DISTRICT. THEY WERE KILLED WITH TWO BURSTS OF MACHINEGUN FIRE. A MORMON CHURCH SPOKESMAN SAID THAT THIS WAS AN ATTACK AGAINST "TWO INNOCENT PEOPLE" AND CALLED ON THE POLICE TO SOLVE THE MURDER. HE SAID THAT LAST YEAR DYNAMITE WAS PLACED AT A TEMPLE IN THE SAME AREA BUT THAT THE CULPRITS WERE NEVER IDENTIFIED. THE BOLIVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS CONDEMNED THE ATTACK AND ORDERED AN IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION. DEPUTY INTERIOR MINISTER WALTER COSTAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE TRAFFIC AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS WILL CARRY OUT DRAGNETS IN LA PAZ. THE KILLING OF THE U.S. MISSIONARIES HAS COINCIDED WITH THE ARRIVAL IN BOLIVIA OF THE FIRST CONTINGENT OF U.S. MILITARY ENGINEERS, TECHNICIANS, AND TROOPS, WHO WILL BE IN CHARGE OF THE TASK OF LEVELING PATTI-PATTI HILL TO BUILD AN AIRPORT FOR THE CITY OF POTOSI.
TST1-MUC3-0072	SANTIAGO, 27 NOV 89 -- AFTER A HUGE EFFORT THE ELECTRIC SUPPLY SYSTEM WAS QUICKLY RESTORED IN THE METROPOLITAN REGION AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY WHICH ON SATURDAY NIGHT WAS AFFECTED BY A BLACKOUT EXTENDING FROM COPIAPO, IN NORTHERN CHILE, TO TALCA, IN SOUTHERN CHILE. CHILECTRA AND ENDESA HAVE ASKED FOR THE CITIZENRY'S UNDERSTANDING.

THE COMPANIES CONCLUDED BY STATING THAT THE TERRORIST ATTACKS AFFECTED THE MAIN POWERLINE AND THAT THE ELECTRIC SUPPLY TO SOME TOWNS WILL BE RESTORED IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS.
TST1-MUC3-0073	SANTIAGO, 29 DEC 89 -- POLICE TODAY REPORTED THAT DURING THE LAST FEW HOURS TERRORISTS STAGED THREE BOMB ATTACKS AGAINST U.S. PROPERTIES.

THEY AFFECTED THE U.S.-CHILEAN CULTURAL INSTITUTE, A MORMON CHURCH IN THE CAPITAL, AND A BRANCH OF THE "CITICORP" FINANCIAL FIRM IN VINA DEL MAR, 125 KM NORTHEAST OF SANTIAGO. CARABINEROS HAVE REPORTED THAT A BOMB, WHICH WAS PLACED ON THE 5TH FLOOR OF THE CHILEAN-U.S. CULTURAL INSTITUTE, 150 METERS FROM THE GOVERNMENT PALACE, WENT OFF LAST NIGHT CAUSING DAMAGE BUT NO VICTIMS. THE BOMB HAD BEEN MANUFACTURED WITH L KILO OF AMMONIUM GELAGNITE AND WAS ACTIVATED WITH A FUSE, POLICE SOURCES SAID. AT 0LL5 THIS MORNING INCENDIARY BOMBS WERE HURLED AT A MORMON TEMPLE AT NUNOA DISTRICT, IN SANTIAGO. THE BOMBS CAUSED MINOR DAMAGE. AT THE TIME OF THE ATTACK THE BUILDING WAS EMPTY, ACCORDING TO THE SOURCES. THE ATTACKERS PAINTED THE WALLS AND LEFT PAMPHLETS WITH ULTRA-LEFTIST MESSAGES OF THE LAUTARO YOUTH FRONT.

THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT , WHICH THE PINOCHET REGIME CONSIDERS TO BE THE COMMUNIST PARTY'S ARMED BRANCH, ANNOUNCED FOLLOWING THE U.S. INVASION OF PANAMA THAT IT WOULD ATTACK "U.S. INTERESTS IN CHILE."
TST1-MUC3-0074	BOGOTA, 2 NOV 89 -- JOSE ALEJANDRO BONIVENTO, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE AND CURRENT MEMBER OF THE COURT OF APPEALS, RESIGNED HIS POST TODAY, CLAIMING THAT HE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO UNDUE PRESSURE BY THE GOVERNMENT.

MARIA ELENA DIAZ PEREZ, THIRD JUDGE OF PUBLIC ORDER, AND TWO OF HER BODYGUARDS FROM THE DAS , WERE ASSASSINATED IN MEDELLIN TODAY BY A GROUP OF 10 PAID ASSASSINS IN TWO CARS, A MAZDA AND WHAT WAS THOUGHT TO BE A MERCURY.

TWO OF HER DAS BODYGUARDS, DAGOBERTO RODRIGUEZ AND ALFONSO DE LIMA, WHO WERE INSIDE THE CAR, WERE KILLED INSTANTLY. NO ONE HAS BEEN ARRESTED YET IN CONNECTION WITH THIS INCIDENT. THE TRUTH IS THAT THE MANY THREATS MADE AGAINST HER BECAME A REALITY TODAY. MARIA ELENA DIAZ, 34, WILL BE BURIED IN MEDELLIN TOMORROW.

TST1-MUC3-0077	BOGOTA, NO DATE -- ACTUALLY, THAT IS NOT SO, BECAUSE WHILE WE ARE GATHERED HERE THE TENTACLES OF THE DRUG TRADE ARE CLOSING IN ON EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST. THE AGGGRESSIVE SEARCH FOR NEW MARKETS DOES NOT RESPECT OCEANS, JUST AS IT HAS NOT RESPECTED BORDERS. ANYWHERE THERE ARE CONSUMERS, THERE WILL BE SUPPLIERS. IN FACT, COCAINE IS BUT ONE OF THE PERNICIOUS MANIFESTATIONS OF THE CRISIS OF DRUG ABUSE, WHICH IS MUCH BROADER. WE MUST NOT DELUDE OURSELVES. THIS SCOURGE AFFECTS US ALL. ACTING IN SOLIDARITY, AS A COMMUNITY OF NATIONS, WE MUST FOLLOW THIS PLAN OF ACTION: FIRST, IT IS INDISPENSABLE TO EFFECTIVELY CURB THE DEMAND FOR ILLEGAL DRUGS. DRUG ABUSE IS THE FUEL THAT PROPELS NARCOTERRORISM. TODAY IT IS ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS THREATS TO LATIN AMERICAN DEMOCRACIES. COCAINE USERS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE KILLING OF MY PEOPLE BY THE CRIMINAL INTERNATIONAL DRUG TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATION. WITHOUT ANY DOUBT, IN ANY OF THE DISTINGUISHED RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS OF THIS CITY, A HABITUAL COCAINE USER MAY REGARD MY ASSERTION AS AN EXAGGERATION. NEVERTHELESS, HIS VICE MAKES HIM A COLLABORATOR OF THE MURDERERS WHO HAVE KILLED MANY COLOMBIAN JUDGES AND POLICEMEN, WHO HAVE SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES TO DEFEND DEMOCRACY AND LAW. NO WEAPON OR TACTIC USED IN THIS STRUGGLE WILL BE EFFECTIVE ENOUGH IF IT IS NOT COMBINED WITH RESOLUTE EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE DEMAND. THE ILLEGAL PROFITS ARE EXTREMELY LARGE. I AM CERTAIN THAT WE WILL DEFEAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN COLOMBIA, BUT SOMEONE IN SOME OTHER COUNTRY, SOMEWHERE, WILL TAKE OVER THIS BUSINESS AS LONG AS IT REMAINS SO PROFITABLE. THIS HAPPENED WITH MARIJUANA. WHEN IT BECAME TOO COSTLY FOR THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO OPERATE IN COLOMBIA BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PUBLIC FORCES, THE TRADERS IN VICE MOVED THEIR PLANTATIONS TO CALIFORNIA, TO HAWAII, AND TO MANY OTHER REGIONS. THE ONLY LAW THE DRUG RUNNERS DO NOT VIOLATE IS THE LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND. NO SOCIETY, REGARDLESS OF HOW WEALTHY IT IS, CAN AFFORD THE LUXURY OF ALLOWING ITS SONS OR DAUGHTERS TO POISON THEMSELVES WITH COCAINE, HEROIN, MARIJUANA, OR ANY OTHER SUCH DEADLY DRUGS. IN THIS CONTEXT, I WISH TO ASSERT THAT PRESIDENT BUSH'S PLAN TO CURB THE DEMAND IS A FIRST STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WE MUST INSIST ON THE MESSAGE THAT ILLEGAL DRUGS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE OR HARMLESS, WHETHER THEY ARE CONSUMED IN THE GLITTERING PARTIES OF THE RICH OR IN THE SLUMS.
TST1-MUC3-0078	BOGOTA, 15 NOV 89 -- MONTERIA -- BLOODY CLASHES HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE IN THE RURAL AREA OF PUERTO LIBERTADOR MUNICIPALITY, SOUTH OF CORDOBA, SINCE 11 NOVEMBER. THE NUMBER OF GUERRILLAS KILLED BY 11TH BRIGADE TROOPS HAS RISEN TO 26. ACCORDING TO REPORTS GIVEN JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO BY MILITARY SOURCES, THREE MORE MEMBERS OF THE SELF-STYLED POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY, EPL, WERE KILLED IN MUTATA, TRES PLAYITAS HAMLET, JUAN JOSE CORREGIMIENTO, IN THE CLASHES THAT TOOK PLACE ON 14 NOVEMBER. THIS BRINGS TO 21 THE NUMBER OF GUERRILLAS KILLED IN THIS AREA OF PUERTO LIBERTADOR MUNICIPALITY. IN ADDITION, FIVE MEMBERS OF THE FARC WERE KILLED IN LA RICA, WHERE COMBAT BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER. IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT THE THE ARMY SUFFERED NO CASUALTIES. SOLDIER LUIS EDUARDO GONZALEZ ANAYA, WHO WAS WOUNDED IN COMBAT, HAS BEEN TAKEN TO THE BOGOTA MILITARY HOSPITAL. IN THE MEANTIME, COLOMBIAN AIR FORCE PERSONNEL ARE REPAIRING THE HELICOPTER THAT MADE AN EMERGENCY LANDING IN THE AREA AFTER BEING DAMAGED, APPARENTLY BY THE REBELS. MILITARY OPERATIONS CONTINUE IN THE RURAL AREA OF PUERTO LIBERTADOR MUNICIPALITY LED AND COORDINATED BY 11TH BRIGADE COMMANDER COLONEL IVAN RAMIREZ QUINTERO.
TST1-MUC3-0079	BOGOTA, 6 MAR 90 -- ...NOT ONLY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE ANDEAN PACT, BUT ALSO OF THE VAST HORIZONS OF THE CARIBBEAN AND THE CENTRAL AMERICAN REGION. AS WE JOIN EFFORTS, AS WE STRENGTHEN OUR CAPABILITIES, AND WITH THE LONG TRADITION OF DEMOCRACY THAT WE SHARE, WE CAN OFFER OUR CONTRIBUTION TO STRENGTHENING OUR DEMOCRACY. ALL THE DEMOCRATS OF THE AMERICAS WHO SEE IN YOU, MR. PRESIDENT PEREZ, A GREAT FIGHTER, ARE NOW CELEBRATING A POSITIVE WAVE OF LEGITIMATE ELECTIONS, FOR EXAMPLE IN URUGUAY, CHILE, BRAZIL, COSTA RICA, AND NICARAGUA. VERY SHORTLY COLOMBIA AND LATER PERU WILL HOLD ELECTIONS. PANAMA, IN TURN, HAS CALLED FOR POPULAR CONSULTATION IN THE FORM OF A REFERENDUM SO THAT THE PEOPLE WILL DECIDE ON IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS. THROUGHOUT THE AMERICAS, DEMOCRACY IS THE PATH AND THAT IS WHY IT WILL BE THE ADEQUATE MEANS FOR STRENGTHENING THE OAS AS A REGIONAL ORGANIZATION IN WHICH THE VARIOUS TRENDS AND IDEOLOGIES WITHIN A COMMON OBJECTIVE OF SEARCHING FOR PEACE, FREEDOM, LIBERTY, AND JUSTICE MAY AND SHOULD BE EXPRESSED AND CONSULTED ON. THERE, THE MEMBERS WILL BE ABLE TO DISCUSS TOPICS THAT AFFECT US IN A DIRECT MANNER, SUCH AS INTERNATIONAL TRADE, FOREIGN DEBT, AND TECHNICAL COOPERATION, AS WELL AS HOW TO INCREASE THE SCOPE OF ACTION WITH VARIOUS INTERLOCUTORS, SUCH AS THE CASE OF CANADA, THE ENTRY IF WHICH INTO THE OAS WE WARMLY WELCOME. THEREFORE, LET US CONSIDER THE REASONS FOR THIS MEETING WHICH WE DO NOT HESITATE IN TERMING HISTORIC. THE DOCUMENTS ARE EVIDENCE OF HOW MUCH WE HAVE ADVANCED IN SPECIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE FIELDS OF ENERGY, COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSPORTATION, AND BORDER TRANSIT; IN JOINT PROGRAMS IN CITY PLANNING SUCH AS THE CUCUTA-VILLA EL ROSARIO-SAN ANTONIO-URENA; IN THE AGRO-INDUSTRIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SECTORS, AND IN INDIAN ETHNIC GROUPS, CUSTOMS, AND EDUCATION. ALL OF THESE ARE TOPICS WE HAVE DISCUSSED OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS WITH OUR RESPECTIVE TEAMS. HOWEVER, THERE IS ONE TOPIC THAT I WISH TO EMPHASIZE. THERE IS AN ENEMY WHO SEEKS TO DESTROY THE INTEGRATIONIST AND DEMOCRATIC PROJECT. THERE ARE ANACHRONISTIC REDOUBTS OF A SUBVERSIVE NATURE THAT ARE TODAY ENFENCED BY OUR MILITARY FORCES AND OUR HARD WORKING PEOPLE. THE ENEMY FEELS HIS DAYS ARE NUMBERED AND HE EXPRESSES HIMSELF THOUGH VIOLENT ACTIONS WITH KIDNAPPINGS, EXTORTION, AND INDISCRIMINATE TERRORISM; BY DESTROYING OIL PIPELINES AND CONTAMINATING RIVERS, WATER BASINS, AND LAGOONS. OUR COMMISSIONS HAVE SUGGESTED POSITIVE MEANS FOR WORKING JOINTLY ON THESE RIVERS, WATER BASINS, AND LAGOONS, AND HAVE SIGNED AN AGREEMENT THAT IS ALREADY BEING IMPLEMENTED ON OIL SPILLS AND ACCIDENTS. COLOMBIAN DEMOCRACY WILL PREVAIL OVER THIS INTERNAL ENEMY, AND UNDOUBTEDLY THE INTEGRATION PROGRAMS WILL CONTINUE WITH RENEWED VIGOR. THE TECHNICAL MANAGEMENT OF THE WATER RESOUCES, THE ELECTRICITY AND TELEPHONE INTERCONNECTIONS, THE FEASIBILITY STUDIES FOR THE VARIOUS ALTERNATE ROUTES THAT WILL CONNECT US, THE REOPENING OF THE BRIDGES THAT WERE CLOSED 30 YEARS AGO, THE UTILIZATION OF THE CAMILO DAZA AIRPORT IN CUCUTA AS AN ALTERNATE AIRPORT FOR SAN ANTONIO, THE AGREEMENT ON FISHING POLICIES, THE PLANS TO INCREASE CROPS RANGING FROM SUGARCANE AND COTTON TO CHIQUI-CHIQUI FIBER ARE POSITIVE ANSWERS TO THOSE WHO INSIST ON DISRUPTING THINGS. THE INTERNATIONAL POLICY TODAY NOT ONLY UNDERSTANDS THE TRADITIONAL CONCEPT AND THE PRESERVATION OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, BUT ABOVE ALL, IT POINTS TO PEOPLE'S WELL-BEING AND INCREASES THEIR CAPABILITIES FOR CONSUMPTION. IT IS NOT BY BLOWING UP OIL PIPELINES OR PREVENTING THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE ALONG THE RIVER BANKS OF BOTH COUNTRIES FROM FISHING OR BY POISONING THEIR CROPS THAT PEOPLE'S WELL-BEING WILL BE ACHIEVED. I AM SURE THAT THE SAN PEDRO ALEJANDRINO DOCUMENT WE SIGNED TODAY IS A GRADUAL, BUT DECISIVE STEP TOWARD AUTHENTIC LATIN AMERICAN INTEGRATION. BY THE DECISION OF THEIR PEOPLE AND PROMOTED BY THEIR RULERS IN THIS SIMPLE ROOM WHERE THE LIBERATOR DIED, WE ARE TODAY CONSOLIDATING THESE BASES THAT WILL NOT BE DESTROYED AND WILL PREVENT IN THE FUTURE ANY FURTHER FRUSTRATIONS OF THE DREAMS OF THE LIBERATOR, BOLIVAR. MIXED COMMISSIONS WILL BE APPOINTED SHORTLY AND WILL GET DOWN TO WORK IN WHAT WE STILL HAVE YET TO DO. THEY WILL CONTINUE WITH A TRULY LIBERATING TASK, THAT TODAY -- AS FROM THE TIMES OF THE CONGRESS OF ANGOSTURA -- IS UNITING OUR TWO NATIONS. THANK YOU.
TST1-MUC3-0080	BOGOTA, 3 APR 90 -- LIBERAL SENATOR FEDERICO ESTRADA VELEZ WAS KIDNAPPED ON 3 APRIL AT THE CORNER OF 60TH AND 48TH STREETS IN WESTERN MEDELLIN, ONLY 100 METERS FROM A METROPOLITAN POLICE CAI . THE ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT LIBERAL PARTY LEADER HAD LEFT HIS HOUSE WITHOUT ANY BODYGUARDS ONLY MINUTES EARLIER. AS HE WAITED FOR THE TRAFFIC LIGHT TO CHANGE, THREE HEAVILY ARMED MEN FORCED HIM TO GET OUT OF HIS CAR AND GET INTO A BLUE RENAULT. HOURS LATER, THROUGH ANONYMOUS TELEPHONE CALLS TO THE METROPOLITAN POLICE AND TO THE MEDIA, THE EXTRADITABLES CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE KIDNAPPING. IN THE CALLS, THEY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL RELEASE THE SENATOR WITH A NEW MESSAGE FOR THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT. LAST WEEK, FEDERICO ESTRADA VELEZ HAD REJECTED TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS.
TST1-MUC3-0081	MEDELLIN, 17 JAN 90 -- THE EXTRADITABLES, A COLOMBIAN MAFIA GROUP LINKED WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES, ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THEY WILL LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND SUSPEND THEIR COCAINE SHIPMENTS. THE EXTRADITABLES ADMITTED TO THE GOVERNMENT'S VICTORY AND ADMITTED THAT THEY WANT PEACE IN COLOMBIA. THE EXTRADITABLES ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL RELEASE ALL THE PEOPLE THEY HAVE ABDUCTED. THEY ADDED THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ANY MORE BOMBINGS, TERRORIST ATTACKS OR MURDERS OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, LAWYERS, AND JOURNALISTS. THE EXTRADITABLES' POSITION IS STATED IN A COMMUNIQUE SENT TO PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S GOVERNMENT BY PATRICIA AND DINA ECHAVARRIA, TWO WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN HELD BY THE EXTRADITABLES SINCE 16 DECEMBER IN MEDELLIN, THE CAPITAL CITY OF NORTHWESTERN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT.
TST1-MUC3-0082	SAN SALVADOR, 28 MAR 89 -- MILITARY AUTHORITIES HAVE REPORTED THAT TWO PEASANTS WERE KILLED WHEN THEY SET OFF A MINE IN MORAZAN DEPARTMENT. THE INCIDENT TOOK PLACE IN THE VICINITY OF PERQUIN, WHEN ERNESTO AND ROSA FERNANDEZ SET OFF AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE PRESUMABLY ABANDONED BY THE FMLN. IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT FOUR TREASURY POLICE OFFICERS WERE WOUNDED LAST NIGHT WHEN URBAN COMMANDOS ATTACKED THEM IN SOYAPANGO. THE INCIDENT TOOK PLACE ON ARMY BOULEVARD WHILE THE OFFICERS WERE ON THEIR WAY TO START GUARD DUTY AT A SHOE FACTORY. IN ANOTHER ACTION, SIX INSURGENTS WERE WOUNDED DURING A CLASH WITH 1ST BRIGADE SOLDIERS IN SAN PEDRO PERULAPAN JURISDICTION, CUSCATLAN DEPARTMENT.
TST1-MUC3-0083	SAN SALVADOR, 26 APR 89 -- A SALVADORAN COURT YESTERDAY PRESENTED A SWORN DECLARATION BY PRESIDENT JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE IN WHICH HE LINKS RIGHTIST LEADER ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON TO THE MARCH 1980 ASSASSINATION OF ARCHBISHOP OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO. THE DECLARATION, WHICH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE REQUESTED FROM THE FOURTH PENAL COURT, DID NOT PROVIDE DETAILS REGARDING EVIDENCE THAT COULD BE USED TO SOLVE THE CASE OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO, WHO WAS A STAUNCH CRITIC OF THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF ITS ALLEGED HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. THE DOCUMENT CONTAINS A LIST OF THE NAMES OF 12 ARMY OFFICERS AND 12 CIVILIANS WHO WERE ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED IN PLOTTING TO OUST THE REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT JUNTA THAT TOOK OVER IN OCTOBER 1979 AFTER OVERTHROWING GENERAL HUMBERTO ROMERO. THE LIST OF PLOTTERS INCLUDES RIGHTIST DEPUTY D'AUBUISSON, FOUNDER OF THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE -- THE WINNER IN THE RECENT ELECTIONS -- AND CAPTAIN ALVARO SARAVIA, WHOM THE PRESIDENT ACCUSED OF BEING THE MASTERMINDS OF THE ASSASSINATION OF THE CLERGYMAN. THE LIST ALSO INCLUDES THE NAMES OF CIVILIANS INVOLVED IN THE KIDNAPPING OF SEVERAL SALVADORAN BUSINESSMEN EARLY IN THE DECADE. ACCORDING TO DUARTE'S DECLARATION, 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE SOLDIERS ARRESTED THE 24 COUP PLOTTERS IN 1980, AND SEVERAL DOCUMENTS WERE SEIZED FROM THEM, INCLUDING A NOTEBOOK WITH PLANS FOR KILLING ROMERO. THE U.S. SENATE HAS A NOTEBOOK OWNED BY CAPT SARAVIA, AND SALVADORAN JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES ARE INVESTIGATING HOW THE U.S. SENATE ENDED UP WITH IT. ACCORDING TO DUARTE, "COLONEL ADOLFO ARNULFO MAJANO, A MEMBER OF THE REVOLUTIONARY JUNTA THAT OUSTED GEN ROMERO, HAD THE DOCUMENTS." THE SALVADORAN SUPREME COURT RECENTLY REVOKED A SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT EXTRADITION REQUEST FOR SARAVIA, WHOM THE GOVERNMENT WANTED TO QUESTION TO HELP SOLVE THE ROMERO CASE. THE ARCHBISHOP WAS KILLED BY A SNIPER WHILE SAYING MASS AT A HOSPITAL FOR CANCER PATIENTS.
TST1-MUC3-0084	SAN SALVADOR, 13 SEP 89 -- WE BELIEVE WE HAVE MADE A GREAT EFFORT TO INCREASE THE POSSIBILITIES OF REACHING AN AGREEMENT. AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE THIS MEETING AND OTHERS THAT MAY COME CAN BE DESCRIBED AS SERIOUS DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION. WE HAVE MADE AN EFFORT SO THAT THE DELEGATIONS CAN HOLD ENOUGH DECISION-MAKING POWER FOR AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I SAID EARLIER THAT OUR PROPOSAL IS AIMED AT ACHIEVING THE COUNTRY'S REAL DEMOCRATIZATION. WE HAVE MADE AN EFFORT TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. WE ARE NOT ASKING THE GOVERNMENT TO GIVE UP THE LEGITIMACY IT SAYS IT HAS OBTAINED IN THE ELECTIONS. WE ARE ASKING THE GOVERNMENT TO SUBMIT IT TO A TEST FOR THE SAKE OF PEACE. IF IT PASSES THE TEST, THEN IT WOULD REAFFIRM ITS POWER. OTHERWISE, WE WERE ALWAYS RIGHT TO DEMAND A NEW CONSENSUS FOR ACHIEVING PEACE IN THE COUNTRY. ON PREVIOUS OCCASIONS THEY SAID THAT OUR PROPOSALS VIOLATED THE CONSTITUTION. WE HAVE MADE A GREAT EFFORT, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE CONSTITUTION BECAUSE IT WAS MADE TO PROMOTE THE WAR. THE CONSTITUTION WAS DRAFTED BASED ON THE KILLING OF OVER 70,000 SALVADORANS. THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY DOES NOT REPRESENT A LARGE PART OF SALVADORAN SOCIETY, BUT WE HAVE MADE AN EFFORT SO THAT THERE ARE NO OBSTACLES TO REACHING AN AGREEMENT. WE HOPE A NEW CONSTITUTION FOR PEACE CAN BE DRAFTED. THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT AT THE BEGINNING THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION INSISTED ON PERFORMING CERTAIN TASKS WHICH WE THOUGHT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE WRONG IDEA OF WHAT A DIALOGUE IS. WE BELIEVE THAT TO EXTEND THE DIALOGUE IN THE CURRENT CONTEXT, IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE EXISTING PRESSURE IN THE COUNTRY, IS TO EXTEND THE WAR. TO HOLD A DIALOGUE FULL OF DETAILS AND AGREEMENTS OF LITTLE IMPORTANCE IS TO EXTEND THE WAR.
TST1-MUC3-0085	SAN SALVADOR, 2 NOV 89 -- COMMANDER FERMAN CIENFUEGOS, WHEN WILL THE DIALOGUE RESUME? WE BELIEVE THAT FOR THE DIALOGUE TO BE RESUMED THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES, MAINLY COLONELS PONCE AND ELENA, AND CRISTIANI MUST SPECIFICALLY ACCEPT THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT ONCE THIS SITUATION AND ALL THE POLITICAL ACTIONS FOR WHICH THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE HAVE BEEN CLARIFIED.... THEY HAVE TO EXPLAIN THINGS VERY CLEARLY BECAUSE WE ARE REALLY TIRED OF HEARING THE FAMOUS PHRASE THAT THEY ALWAYS USE; THAT IS, THAT THEY ARE GOING TO INVESTIGATE. THAT IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE; THEREFORE, WE ARE DEMANDING THAT THE SITUATION BE CLARIFIED. MEANWHILE, WE ARE GOING TO TALK TO THE OBSERVERS AND MEDIATORS TO CHECK ON HOW THE SITUATION IS DEVELOPING AND AT THE SAME TIME TO STUDY THE CONDITIONS FOR THE DIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION. I BELIEVE THAT THE NATURE OF THE SUSPENSION HAS BEEN WELL EXPLAINED. THESE CONDITIONS MUST BE MET BEFORE WE CAN, LET US SAY, RESUME THE MEETING. IT MUST BE MADE VERY CLEAR THAT THE AGREEMENT TO HOLD A DIALOGUE, THE CONTINUITY OF THE DIALOGUE, HAS NOT BEEN BROKEN. THIS WAS AGREED ON BY THE TWO PARTIES, AND THIS IS NOT WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. WHAT WE DID WAS SUSPEND THE MEETING THAT HAS CREATED SO MANY EXPECTATIONS. THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT STATED THAT THERE WOULD BE A CEASE-FIRE AND A GRADUAL PROCESS TO PUT AN END TO HOSTILITIES THAT WOULD LEAD TO THE END OF THE WAR; HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER FOR THIS TO BE DONE, WE MUST FIRST HAVE SPECIFIC DEMOCRATIC CONDITIONS. THAT IS WHAT CRISTIANI SIGNED IN TELA, HONDURAS. WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE IS THE UNMASKING OF A FASCIST DICTATORSHIP. WE ARE SEEING A FASCIST AND TERRORIST CLIQUE. THE MEMBERS OF THE DEATH SQUADS ARE PRACTICALLY LEGAL IN EL SALVADOR.
TST1-MUC3-0086	SAN SALVADOR, 14 NOV 89 -- THE FMLN FAILED EVEN BEFORE IT TRIED TO ENTER OUR COUN.... OUR CAPITAL, AND THIS WAS STATED BY TERRORISTS WHO HAVE SURRENDERED AND TERRORISTS WHO HAVE BEEN APPREHENDED. THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE BROUGHT TO THE CAPITAL UNDER FALSE PRETENSES. THEY WERE LED TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE GOING ALONG FOR A RIDE AND THAT ALL THE PEOPLE WOULD SUPPORT THEM, AND THAT THE ARMED FORCES WOULD NOT PUT UP A FIGHT. THIS, MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, HAS BEEN THE HARSHEST BLOW FOR THE FMLN BECAUSE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE REJECTED AND SPURNED THEM WHEN THEY TRIED TO EXPOSE THE PEOPLE TO SO MUCH DANGER AND HARM. IT WAS ALSO SATISFACTORY TO HEAR THE MANY STATEMENTS OF SUPPORT AND SOLIDARITY GIVEN BY SO MANY SALVADORANS. THEY HAVE TALKED THROUGH THE NATIONAL NETWORK AND EVERY OTHER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION, AND HAVE REJECTED AND SPURNED THE FMLN AND ITS TERRORIST ACTIONS. FURTHERMORE, THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR AND THE MINISTRIES OF AGRICULTURE AND ECONOMY ARE DRAFTING A PROGRAM TO HELP THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE FMLN'S ACTIONS--ONCE EVERYTHING IS CALM--AND TO RESUPPLY THE SUPERMARKETS AND STORES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WE KNOW THE PEOPLE HAVE HAD PROBLEMS GETTING FOOD FOR THE LAST 2 AND 1/2 DAYS AND THE SUPPLIES SHOULD BE BROUGHT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE DO NOT WANT TO END THIS ADDRESS WITHOUT STATING OUR DEEP GRATITUDE FOR YOUR--AND THE OTHER SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S--COURAGEOUS ATTITUDE IN THE FACE OF THE FMLN AGGRESSION. WE CAN ONLY FEEL PROUD ABOUT THE MESSAGES OF SUPPORT--NOT FOR US ON A PERSONAL BASIS BUT FOR THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM, THE RIGHTS THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE DEMAND--AND FOR THE SUPPORT GIVEN TO THE ARMED FORCES, WHOSE MORALE IS HIGH AND WHO TAKE PRIDE IN THE PROFESSIONALISM WHICH THEY HAVE ACQUIRED THROUGHOUT THE YEARS TO COUNTER THE SITUATION IN THE SHORTEST TIME POSSIBLE. WE KNOW THAT THE FMLN HAS FAILED, AND NOW IT IS A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THE ARMED FORCES MANAGE TO TURN THE SITUATION AROUND COMPLETELY. ALSO, WE WANT TO STATE OUR DEEP GRATITUDE TO THE FRIENDLY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE SHOWN THEIR SUPPORT AND SOLIDARITY-- MOST OF ALL THEIR SOLIDARITY WITH YOU, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE-- BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN STATEMENTS WHICH, FRANKLY, HAVE FILLED US WITH EMOTION. FOR EXAMPLE, THOSE OF COSTA RICA, THE UNITED STAES, GUATEMALA, AND, IN SHORT, ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT KNOW PERFECTLY WELL HOW IRRATIONAL THE FMLN'S AGGRESSION IS. THEY HAVE REALIZED THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE REPUBLIC, WHICH ARE THE RESULT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S WILL, HAVE BEGUN A RATIONAL, PEACEFUL, AND DEMOCRATIC PROCESS TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY. TO CONCLUDE, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT AND UNDERSTANDING; BUT ALSO YOUR TRUST AND SERENITY. YOU CAN REST ASSURED THAT THE ARMED FORCES AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL EMERGE VICTORIOUS FROM THE AGGRESSION WHICH THE FMLN TERRORISTS HAVE LAUNCHED. IT IS A DESPERATE ACTION AND, IN COUNTERING THE SITUATION, WE WILL BE MUCH CLOSER TO THE PEACE WE WANT SO MUCH. MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND THANK YOU.
TST1-MUC3-0087	SAN SALVADOR, 18 NOV 89 -- GUILLERMO UNGO, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, AND LEADER OF THE CIVILIAN LEFT IN EL SALVADOR, TODAY LEFT FOR VENEZUELA ACCOMPANIED BY VENEZUELAN AMBASSADOR FEDERICO MALESPINA, ACCORDING TO DIPLOMATIC SOURCES.

TST1-MUC3-0090	SAN SALVADOR, 19 MAR 90 -- A BOMB WENT OFF THIS MORNING NEAR A POWER TOWER IN SAN SALVADOR LEAVING A LARGE PART OF THE CITY WITHOUT ENERGY, BUT NO CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED. ACCORDING TO UNOFFICIAL SOURCES, THE BOMB -- ALLEGEDLY DETONATED BY URBAN GUERRILLA COMMANDOS -- BLEW UP A POWER TOWER IN THE NORTHWESTERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR AT 0650 . ON FRIDAY, 16 MARCH, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT DECREED A SUSPENSION OF ITS ATTACKS ON CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND OF ITS SABOTAGE OPERATIONS AGAINST MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION, BUSINESSES, AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS. THAT DECISION, AIMED AT CREATING THE APPROPRIATE CONDITIONS FOR A NEW ROUND OF TALKS WITH THE GOVERNMENT, DOES NOT INCLUDE THE ENERGY SYSTEM OR ARMED FORCES' MEMBERS AND INSTALLATIONS.
TST1-MUC3-0091	CLANDESTINE, 28 MAR 89 -- WHEN NAPOLEON DUARTE WAS PROCLAIMED PRESIDENT OF EL SALVADOR IN 1984, THE WHITE HOUSE, STATE DEPARTMENT, PENTAGON, AND ALL THE POWERFUL CIRCLES IN THE UNITED STATES WERE STRICKEN WITH EUPHORIA AND OPTIMISM. DUARTE PROMISED A SOCIAL PACT, A TOLERANT REGIME, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REFORMS, AND, MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, HE PROMISED PEACE. ALL OF THESE PROMISES WERE ONLY A MEANS OF ACHIEVING WASHINGTON'S GREAT OBJECTIVE: TO CONTROL THE REVOLUTION IN EL SALVADOR OR, IN OTHER WORDS, COUNTERINSURGENCY. FIVE YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN. IN REALITY 8 YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE EL SALVADOR BECAME THE PLACE WHERE THE REAGAN ERA'S MODELS OF COUNTERINSURGENCY, NEODICTATORSHIP, AND LOW-INTENSITY WARFARE WERE IMPLEMENTED. WASHINGTON'S EUPHORIA AND OPTIMISM HAVE COMPLETELY VANISHED. THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS SEALED THE COLLAPSE OF THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION'S SALVADORAN STRATEGY. TWO BASIC FACTORS ARE AT THE ROOT OF THE U.S. FAILURE: FIRST, THE UNITED STATES SOUGHT DEMAGOGIC AND POLITICALLY UNSOUND REFORMS. DUARTE DID NOT IN ANY WAY IMPROVE THE MASSES' EXTREME POVERTY AND ISOLATION. SECOND, THE REVOLUTIONARY, POPULAR, AND DEMOCRATIC FORCES' QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE PROGRESS WAS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE PROBLEMS THAT LED TO THE CONFLICT ARE--TODAY MORE THAN EVER--STILL UNRESOLVED. THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS RESULTED IN AN ARENA VICTORY, AND ARENA IS THE PARTY THAT REPRESENTS THE MOST ULTRACONSERVATIVE OLIGARCHIC SECTORS. WASHINGTON HAS RETURNED TO ITS STARTING POINT. THE $3 BILLION SPENT ON MILITARY ADVICE AND THE GENOCIDE OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS SERVED NO PURPOSE WHATSOEVER. IT IS ALL OVER. ARENA REPRESENTS A RETURN TO THE SYSTEM USED PRIOR TO 15 OCTOBER 1979. IN OTHER WORDS, IT IS A RETURN TO DICTATORIAL CONTROL OF ALL POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND MILITARY POWER. THIS IS THE END, THE SAD END OF THE LOW-INTENSITY WAR EXERCISE. U.S. GENERAL HARRY GORDON SUMMER, A MEMBER OF THE SANTA FE GROUP, IN HIS BOOK ON THE MISTAKES THE UNITED STATES MADE IN VIETNAM, SAID THE UNITED STATES' CONCEPT OF VICTORY AFTER ITS DEFEAT IN VIETNAM CAN NO LONGER BE TO ACHIEVE ITS ENEMY'S UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER, AS IN WORLD WAR II, BUT TO ACHIEVE THE POLITICAL OBJECTIVES FOR WHICH IT STARTED THE WAR. THIS IS PRECISELY THE CONCEPT OF VICTORY USED IN LOW-INTENSITY WARFARE. ARENA'S VICTORY, AND THE SUBSEQUENT RETURN TO THE OLD SYSTEM, IS OBVIOUSLY CONTRARY TO THE OBJECTIVE OF LOW-INTENSITY WARFARE. FOR WASHINGTON, OF COURSE, THIS DEFEAT MEANS THAT $3 BILLION WAS SQUANDERED. FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND CENTRAL AMERICANS, IT MEANS RAZED TOWNS, DEVASTATED ECONOMIES, AND THE DEATH OF 70,000 PEOPLE. THE NEW U.S. ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT HAVE A DEFINITE PLAN FOR EL SALVADOR. WHAT IT HAS IS AN UNCOMFORTABLE ALLY, ARENA, AND A SOCIAL TIME BOMB ABOUT TO EXPLODE. THE FMLN BELIEVES THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION SHOULD STUDY THE NEW SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR AND THE ENTIRE WORLD IN A REALISTIC AND PRAGMATIC MANNER. THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR CONTINUES AND WILL CONTINUE AS LONG AS THERE IS NO CHANGE, NO REAL CHANGE, TO BENEFIT THE MASSES THAT ARE STRUGGLING FOR THAT CHANGE. THIS IS OUR NEW REALITY, AND IF THE NEW U.S. ADMINISTRATION WANTS PEACE AND STABILITY IN THE REGION, IT MUST ESTABLISH A FOREIGN POLICY THAT REFLECTS THAT REALITY.
TST1-MUC3-0092	CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- 4. AT 0640 AN FMLN GUERRILLA UNIT LAUNCHED AN ATTACK ON CONCHAGUA BATTALION AND 3D MILITARY DETACHMENT SOLDIERS WHO WERE TRAVELING ON THE ROAD BETWEEN ANAMOROS AND LISLIQUE, 1 KM FROM LISLIQUE, LA UNION DEPARTMENT. THE CLASH, CARRIED OUT IN BROAD DAYLIGHT, ENDED AT 0930. WE KILLED THREE AND WOUNDED FIVE, AND TOOK FOUR PRISONERS OF WAR IN THAT AREA OF LA UNION DEPARTMENT. A CHIEF OF SECTION, A SERGEANT, IS AMONG THE DEAD. WE SEIZED SIX RIFLES, AN M-79 GRENADE LAUNCHER, AND . MEANWHILE, ANOTHER FMLN UNIT ENTERED LISLIQUE, WHERE THEY CARRIED OUT POLITICAL ACTIVITIES FOR 3 HOURS. 5. AT 0300 FMLN UNITS ATTACKED AN INFANTRY COMPANY AT THE MOUTH OF THE LEMPA RIVER, AND 30 MINUTES LATER OUR FORCES HAD TAKEN OVER THE POST. WE KILLED ONE AND WOUNDED FOUR, AND SEIZED A RIFLE, A LAW ROCKET LAUNCHER, THREE BACKPACKS, AND WAR MATERIEL. 6. URBAN GUERRILLAS SABOTAGED PYLONS AND TRANSFORMERS IN SAN MIGUEL CITY. 7. A NATIONAL POLICE POST IN BERLIN WAS RAIDED AND ATTACKED. ATTENTION: DURING THIS OPERATION LAUNCHED THROUGHOUT THE FOUR EASTERN DEPARTMENTS, WE INFLICTED A TOTAL OF 67 CASUALTIES. AMONG THESE CASUALTIES ARE: THE CHIEF OF THE CACAHUATIQUE BATTALION, A CAPTAIN, A LIEUTENANT, AND A SERGEANT. WE CAPTURED SIX PRISONERS OF WAR DURING THIS OPERATION. WE ALSO SEIZED 37 RIFLES, A 90-MM CANNON, 2 M-70 MACHINE GUNS, 3 LAW ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 3 M-79 GRENADE LAUNCHERS, 5 MILITARY RADIOS, 38 BACKPACKS, AND 6,800 ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION, AND WE DAMAGED A HELICOPTER. THIS IS THE RESULT OF OUR OPERATION: THE EASTERN SECTOR IS COURAGEOUS; EVERYONE AGAINST ARENA.
TST1-MUC3-0093	CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- WE WILL ORGANIZE A PLURALIST GOVERNMENT WHICH INCLUDES REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL THE PATRIOTIC GROUPS OF THE NATION. LET US SAVE OUR CAPITAL, WHICH IS BEING BOMBED DUE TO A FOREIGN MENTALITY. IT IS BEING BOMBED AND DESTROYED BY AN OCCUPATION ARMY. THE AIRPLANES ARE NOW BEING FLOWN BY U.S. PILOTS AT NIGHT, AND THEY HAVE THE MENTALITY OF AN OCCUPATION ARMY. SALVADORANS, LET US UNITE AND ORGANIZE OURSELVES. LET US NOT REMAIN IDLE. WE MUST MOBILIZE OURSELVES RIGHT NOW AND ORGANIZE A COMMITTEE IN EACH NEIGHBORHOOD, RESIDENTIAL AREA, AND TOWN. THE PEOPLE MUST ORGANIZE. THE FMLN HAS BEGUN ITS 7TH DAY IN THE CAPITAL, AND WE ARE SURE THAT WE ARE ADVANCING TOWARD VICTORY. VICTORY WILL BE OURS AND COLONEL PONCE HAS GIVEN PROOF OF HIS DESPERATION WITH THE JESUIT PRIESTS' ASSASSINATION IN SAN SALVADOR. HE HAS OVERSTEPPED HIS MARK AND THE PEOPLE'S PATIENCE IS EXHAUSTED. WE URGE ALL OUR PEOPLE TO JOIN THE GENERAL UPRISING, STRUGGLE, TAKE UP WEAPONS, AND ORGANIZE EVERYTHING NECESSARY TO OUST THIS CORRUPT AND MURDEROUS REGIME. WE URGE THE PEOPLE TO MOBILIZE,TO TAKE UP WEAPONS, AND TO STAY IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS TO STRUGGLE FOR THE LIBERATION OF OUR HOMELAND. WE MUST ACHIEVE PROGRESS. INFORMATION HAS JUST ARRIVED FROM THE UNITED STATES, INDICATING THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN TO WITHDRAW ITS UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE DEATH SQUADS IN EL SALVADOR. INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM THE UNITED STATES INDICATES THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN TO RECANT ITS IRRESPONSIBLE AND GENOCIDAL ATTITUDE OF SENDING U.S. PILOTS TO BOMB OUR CAPITAL BY NIGHT. THAT IS THE PROFESSIONAL TRAINING THAT U.S. IMPERIALISM IS CURRENTLY GIVING THE ARMED FORCES, MEANING TO BOMB THE CAPITAL BY NIGHT, AS ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE CAPITAL HAVE WITNESSED IN RECENT HOURS. THUS, WE ISSUE AN APPEAL TO THE PEOPLE: ORGANIZE YOURSELVES. WE WILL ACHIEVE VICTORY. WE SURE OF THIS. THE BLOOD OF IGNACIO ELLACURIA, THE BLOOD OF THE JESUITS, THE BLOOD OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO, THE BLOOD OF THE FOUR U.S. NUNS, THE BLOOD OF THE 11 PRIESTS ASSASSINATED , THE BLOOD OF SEMINARIANS, YOUTHS , AND FOR ALL THE BLOOD SHED. WE MUST WIN, WE MUST ACHIEVE VICTORY, WE MUST ATTAIN A TRUE DEMOCRACY FOR OUR HOMELAND -- A DEMOCRACY WITH FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, FOOD, EDUCATION, AND JUSTICE.
TST1-MUC3-0094	CLANDESTINE, 18 NOV 89 -- WE URGE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TO IMMEDIATELY WITHDRAW FROM THE ILOPANGO AIR BASE THE U.S. PILOTS WHO ARE HERE TO PARTICIPATE IN AIR BOMBINGS DURING THE NIGHT TO RELIEVE THE TIRED AND GENOCIDAL PILOTS OF GENERAL JUAN RAFAEL BUSTILLO. WE URGE THE U.S. EMBASSY TO WITHDRAW THE U.S. PILOTS. OTHERWISE, THE NEXT PLANES AND HELICOPTERS WILL BE DOWNED WITH U.S. PILOTS -- LIKE THOSE WHO HAVE COME FROM A U.S. BASE IN HONDURAS -- ON BOARD.
TST1-MUC3-0095	CLANDESTINE, 18 DEC 89 -- A REPORT FROM USULUTAN DEPARTMENT STATES THAT AT 0930 ON 18 DECEMBER, 18 OF THE PRISONERS OF WAR CAPTURED DURING THE BATTLE OF EL NISPERAL, WHICH IS LOCATED 4 KM NORTH OF THE CITY OF USULUTAN, WERE RELEASED. PREVIOUS REPORTS INDICATED THAT A TOTAL OF 25 SOLDIERS WERE CAPTURED IN EL NISPERAL AND THAT A FEW OF THEM HAD BEEN RELEASED. NOW, AT 0930 AT THE SAN JORGE PARK, THE REMAINING PRISONERS OF WAR WERE RELEASED DURING A POLITICAL EVENT ATTENDED BY TOWN RESIDENTS. DURING THIS BROADCAST OUR GUERRILLA STATION WILL ALSO AIR INTERVIEWS WITH THE PRISONERS CAPTURED AT EL NISPERAL WHERE, DURING THE BATTLE, ONE ARMY COMPANY WAS ANNIHILATED AND TWO OTHERS WERE ATTACKED, LEAVING A TOTAL OF 29 SOLDIERS KILLED, 30 WOUNDED, AND 25 CAPTURED. WE HAVE ALREADY INFORMED THE PEOPLE THAT DURING THE EL NISPERAL BATTLE OUR UNITS CAPTURED 46 M-16 RIFLES, 2 M-60 MACHINEGUNS, 13 LAW ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 4 M-79 GRENADE LAUNCHERS WITH 40 GRENADES, AND 11,000 ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION. IN EARLIER REPORTS WE HAD UNDERSCORED THAT SINCE 1984, A BATTLE OF SUCH PROPORTIONS HAD NOT BEEN STAGED IN FULL DAYLIGHT AGAINST INFANTRY, ARTILLERY, AND AVIATION, AND IN THIS CASE, WE ESPECIALLY UNDERSCORED THAT THE THEATER OF OPERATIONS HAD CHANGED AND A BATTLE WAS STAGED IN A VITAL AREA FOR THE WAR ECONOMY.
TST1-MUC3-0096	GUATEMALA CITY, 28 MAR 89 -- THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT REPORTS THAT ON SUNDAY, 26 MARCH, AS RELATIVES WERE VISITING THE PAVON REHABILITATION FARM, A PRISON REVOLT ERUPTED. THE REVOLT WAS STARTED BY 28 PRISONERS -- ALL CONSIDERED VERY DANGEROUS -- ORGANIZED INTO SEVEN GROUPS. THE MUTINIOUS PRISONERS WORKED OUT A DETAILED PLAN AND ATTACKED VARIOUS IMPORTANT OFFICES, SUCH AS THE ARMORY, WHERE THEY SEIZED ABOUT 90 CARBINES AND MUCH AMMUNITION, WHICH THEY IMMEDIATELY USED TO ATTACK THE SECURITY GUARDS. AT THE TIME, THERE WERE 107 MEN, 366 WOMEN, AND 154 CHILDREN -- A TOTAL OF 627 PEOPLE -- VISITING THE DETAINEES. THEY HAVE BEEN HELD HOSTAGE SINCE THE UPRISING BEGAN. THE PRISONERS' ESCAPE ATTEMPT WAS THWARTED BY THE SECURITY GUARDS, WHO WERE ABLE TO CARRY OUT THEIR ASSIGNED MISSION. THE GUARDS WERE ABLE TO REPEL THE SURPISE ATTACK; HOWEVER, CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS BUENAVENTURA MARTINEZ, 47, AND GERONIMO ALVARADO, 21, WERE KILLED IN THE CLASH. THE GOVERNMENT STATES THAT ACCORDING TO ITS INVESTIGATION, THE LEADERS OF THE RIOT WERE JULIO ENRIQUE REYES GRANADOS, MARCO ANTONIO SANTIZO LINARES, AND VICTOR MANUEL VELIZ DUARTE, WHO ARE DOING TIME FOR KIDNAPPING CHILDREN, EXTORTION, MURDER, ROBBERY, ASSAULT AND BATTERY, AND OTHER CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES. VELIZ DUARTE WAS KILLED IN THE CLASH BY GUNSHOTS TO HIS JAW AND STOMACH. HE HAD BEEN SENTENCED TO 30 YEARS IN PRISON FOR DOUBLE MURDER. FOLLOWING THE UNSUCCESSFUL UPRISING IN THE PAVON MODEL REHABILITATION FARM, A COMMISSION OF PRISONERS HAS PRESENTED A HUMANITARIAN PETITION TO THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS BEING CONSIDERED. OTHER LEGAL PETITIONS WILL BE DEALT WITH BY THE APPROPRIATE ORGANIZATIONS.
TST1-MUC3-0097	TEGUCIGALPA, 6 FEB 89 -- THE HONDURAN POLICE TODAY PRESENTED TO REPORTERS TWO OF THE PRESUMED KILLERS OF CONTRA COMMANDER MANUEL RUGAMA ACEVEDO, ALIAS "AURELIANO." ONE OF THE MEN ACCUSED AN OFFICIAL OF THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE CRIME. "AURELIANO," CONSIDERED TO BE THE SECOND IN COMMAND OF THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS, WAS GUNNED DOWN BY AN UNIDENTIFIED GROUP IN TEGUCIGALPA'S NORTHERN OUTSKIRTS ON 7 JANUARY AFTER ATTENDING A WORKING MEETING WITH OTHER REBEL LEADERS. THE POLICE DETAINED HONDURANS JUAN BAUTISTA AND RIGOBERTO MATUTE AND NICARAGUAN LUIS ORDONEZ, WHO ARE BEING HELD AS SUSPECTS IN AURELIANO'S MURDER. OTHER SUSPECTS ARE STILL BEING PURSUED. ONLY BAUTISTA AND ORDONEZ WERE PRESENTED TO REPORTERS. MATUTE IS BEING HELD OUTSIDE TEGUCIGALPA AS A WITNESS IN THE CASE. ORDONEZ SAID HE "PARTICIPATED ONLY AS A GO-BETWEEN" SO JOSE DE JESUS PENA, THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY OFFICIAL, COULD MEET MATUTE, WHO WORKED AS A MESSENGER FOR ORDONEZ AT THE EXCHANGE OFFICE HE RUNS IN TEGUCIGALPA. ORDONEZ ADDED: "I WAS AWARE THAT PENA WANTED TO GET RID OF SOMEBODY, BUT I NEVER LEARNED WHO THEY WERE GOING TO KILL UNTIL 'AURELIANO' WAS ELIMINATED." ORDONEZ ALSO SAID HE WORKED FOR THE SOMOZA REGIME, THAT HE LATER AIDED THE CONTRAS FINANCIALLY IN HONDURAS, PARTICULARLY THE REBEL INDIAN ORGANIZATION MISURASATA , AND THAT WIDCLIFE DIEGO, A MISURASATA LEADER, OWES HIM $25,000. ORDONEZ SAID FURTHER THAT HE PROVIDED INFORMATION ON THE CONTRAS SEVERAL TIMES TO THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY THROUGH PENA, WHO GAVE HIM $1,000 ALMOST EVERY MONTH. ORDONEZ DENIED THAT HE PARTICIPATED DIRECTLY IN THE CRIME: "ON SATURDAY, 7 JANUARY, WHEN 'AURELIANO' WAS KILLED, I WAS AT A COCK FIGHT IN EL PROGRESO" ON HONDURAS' NORTHERN COAST. ORDONEZ SAID: "I ALSO WAS IN TOUCH WITH THE HONDURAN SECRET POLICE, ONE OF WHOSE LIEUTENANTS, WORKING FOR INTERPOL, CALLED ME UP A FEW DAYS AGO. HE TOLD ME LATER, HOWEVER, THAT OTHER OFFICERS WANTED TO SEE ME. THAT IS HOW I WAS DETAINED." IN ADDITION, BAUTISTA CLAIMED THAT HE WAS HIRED BY MATUTE DURING TWO MEETINGS THEY HELD AND THAT MATUTE OFFERED TO PAY HIM $10,000 TO KILL SOMEBODY, PRESUMABLY A CONTRA COMMANDER WHO ALSO INTENDED TO KILL MATUTE. BAUTISTA SAID THAT A FEW DAYS PRIOR TO THE CRIME, MATUTE INTRODUCED TO HIM ANOTHER PERSON, CANO ARTEAGA, WHO IS STILL AT LARGE AND WHO TOLD BAUTISTA THAT IT WAS ORDONEZ WHO WANTED THE MAN DEAD. BAUTISTA SAID THAT, ON THE DAY OF THE CRIME, HE MET WITH MATUTE AND CANO. THEY DROVE AROUND THE PLACE SEVERAL TIMES UNTIL THEY INTERCEPTED THE CONTRA COMMANDER'S CAR. "I OPENED FIRE WITH A .38 CALIBER REVOLVER. AURELIANO GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND WAS HIT BY MATUTE'S SHOTS. CANO FINISHED HIM OFF." BAUTISTA SAID HIS TWO COMPANIONS WERE ARMED WITH .45 CALIBER PISTOLS. AFTER THE CRIME, THEY WENT THEIR SEPARATE WAYS TO WAIT TO RECEIVE THE PROMISED MONEY IN A TEGUCIGALPA PARK ON 15 FEBRUARY. POLICE SOURCES AND COLONEL MANUEL ENRIQUE SUAREZ, HEAD OF THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES' PUBLIC RELATIONS DEPARTMENT, WHO PRESENTED THE CRIMINALS TO THE REPORTERS, DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE INVOLVEMENT OF A NICARAGUAN EMBASSY OFFICIAL IN THE CRIME. SUAREZ SAID: "IT IS UP TO THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT TO COMMENT ON THIS CASE OR TO TRY TO ESTABLISH WHETHER A DIPLOMAT PARTICIPATED. THE POLICE HAVE ALREADY DONE THEIR DUTY." THERE WAS NOBODY AVAILABLE AT THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA TO COMMENT ON THE ALLEDGED INVOLVEMENT OF ONE OF THE EMBASSY OFFICIALS IN THE ASSASSINATION. THE EMBASSY WOULD NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY THAT SOMEONE NAMED JOSE DE JESUS PENA WORKED THERE.
TST1-MUC3-0098	LIMA, 3 FEB 89 -- IN HUANCAYO, IT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED THAT VICTOR POLAY CAMPOS, ALIAS COMRADE ROLANDO, ONE OF THE TOP LEADERS OF THE TERRORIST ORGANIZATION MRTA, HAS BEEN CAPTURED. HE AND HIS ARMED GROUP HAD GAINED NOTORIETY IN THE PERUVIAN JUNGLE AREA. IT MAY BE RECALLED THAT COMRADE ROLANDO AND 100 ARMED SUBVERSIVES RAIDED SAN MARTIN DEPARTMENT IN 1987. THROUGH HIS CAPTURE, THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE DEALT A HARD BLOW TO THIS TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.
TST1-MUC3-0099	LIMA, 25 OCT 89 -- POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT TERRORISTS TONIGHT BOMBED THE EMBASSIES OF THE PRC AND THE SOVIET UNION. THE BOMBS CAUSED DAMAGE BUT NO INJURIES. A CAR-BOMB EXPLODED IN FRONT OF THE PRC EMBASSY, WHICH IS IN THE LIMA RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT OF SAN ISIDRO. MEANWHILE, TWO BOMBS WERE THROWN AT A USSR EMBASSY VEHICLE THAT WAS PARKED IN FRONT OF THE EMBASSY LOCATED IN ORRANTIA DISTRICT, NEAR SAN ISIDRO. POLICE SAID THE ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY AND THAT THE BOMBS BROKE WINDOWS AND DESTROYED THE TWO VEHICLES. NO ONE HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACKS SO FAR. POLICE SOURCES, HOWEVER, HAVE SAID THE ATTACKS COULD HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT BY THE MAOIST "SHINING PATH" GROUP OR THE GUEVARIST "TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT" GROUP. THE SOURCES ALSO SAID THAT THE SHINING PATH HAS ATTACKED SOVIET INTERESTS IN PERU IN THE PAST. IN JULY 1989 THE SHINING PATH BOMBED A BUS CARRYING NEARLY 50 SOVIET MARINES INTO THE PORT OF EL CALLAO. FIFTEEN SOVIET MARINES WERE WOUNDED. SOME 3 YEARS AGO TWO MARINES DIED FOLLOWING A SHINING PATH BOMBING OF A MARKET USED BY SOVIET MARINES. IN ANOTHER INCIDENT 3 YEARS AGO, A SHINING PATH MILITANT WAS KILLED BY SOVIET EMBASSY GUARDS INSIDE THE EMBASSY COMPOUND. THE TERRORIST WAS CARRYING DYNAMITE. THE ATTACKS TODAY COME AFTER SHINING PATH ATTACKS DURING WHICH LEAST 10 BUSES WERE BURNED THROUGHOUT LIMA ON 24 OCT.
TST1-MUC3-0100	LIMA, 1 APR 90 -- THE PERUVIAN ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN TODAY ENTERED ITS FINAL STRETCH, WITH ONLY ONE WEEK TO GO IN AN ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN THAT HAS BEEN THE MOST DISPUTED AND DANGEROUS ONE IN THE HISTORY OF THAT ANDEAN COUNTRY, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF TERRORIST THREATS. THE SPREADING WAVE OF TERRORISM, AIMED AT STOPPING THE ELECTIONS FROM TAKING PLACE, FORCED PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA'S ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE DRASTIC SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT THE NEARLY 3,500 CANDIDATES ARE DEPLOYED, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS UNDER STATE OF EMERGENCY AND WHERE THE ACTIVITIES OF SHINING PATH'S TERRORIST GANGS ARE MORE WIDESPREAD, SUCH AS LIMA AND THE DEPARTMENTS OF AYACUCHO, HUANCAVELICA, APURIMAC, AND JUNIN. THE GOVERNMENT HAS APPOINTED FOUR MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES TO PROTECT EACH CANDIDATE AND HAS TAKEN OUT LIFE INSURANCE ON ALMOST 250,000 PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SELECTED BY LOTTERY TO WORK AT OVER 52,000 POLLING STATIONS. IN LIMA ALONE, HUNDREDS OF MEMBERS OF POLLING STATION TEAMS HAVE ASKED TO BE RELIEVED OF THIS DUTY, PETITIONS WHICH FOR THE MOST PART HAVE BEEN REFUSED BY THE THE ELECTORAL COURT. IN LIMA, THE MAIN OBSTACLE TO NORMAL ELECTIONS ON SUNDAY COULD BE THE STRIKE OF PRIVATE BUS OWNERS WHO ARE AFRAID OF TERRORIST REPRISALS. THE "MINI-BUS-OWNERS" HAVE ASKED THAT FOUR POLICEMEN BE ASSIGNED TO EACH BUS, A REQUEST THAT DEPARTMENTAL PREFECT JACOBO MISHKIN HAS DEEMED "IMPOSSIBLE." "IF THERE IS NO TRANSPORTATION, THE PEOPLE WILL WALK," PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA HAS SAID, REAFFIRMING HIS "ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE" THAT THE PERUVIAN PEOPLE WILL VOTE EN MASSE -- DESPITE THE TERRORIST THREATS -- TO "STRENGTHEN DEMOCRACY," RECOVERED IN 1980 AFTER 12 YEARS OF MILITARY GOVERNMENTS. PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA, NATIONAL ELECTION BOARD PRESIDENT CARLOS CASTANEDA, AND THE CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN URGING THE NEARLY 10 MILLION VOTERS TO COMPLY WITH THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY BY CASTING THEIR VOTES. THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS THAT A LARGE TURNOUT WILL AMOUNT TO "THE MOST EFFECTIVE REJECTION OF SUBVERSION" AND THAT IT WILL "STRENGTHEN DEMOCRACY" IN PERU, WHICH HAS ALMOST 22 MILLION INHABITANTS. OUT OF THE NINE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, FOUR HAVE THE BEST CHANCES, ALTHOUGH ONLY THE CANDIDATE OF THE CENTER RIGHT, MARIO VARGAS LLOSA, IS THE CLEAR-CUT FAVORITE. HE WILL GET AN ESTIMATED 45 PERCENT OF THE VOTES, ACCORDING TO THE LATEST SURVEYS. ACCORDING TO PERUVIAN LAW, IF VARGAS LLOSA DOES NOT GET ABSOLUTE MAJORITY HE WILL HAVE TO PARTICIPATE IN A RUNOFF ELECTION WITH THE SECOND-PLACE CANDIDATE. SINCE IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT VARGAS LLOSA, THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THE DEMOCRATIC FRONT , WILL WIN THE FIRST ROUND, THE QUESTION NOW IS WHO WILL BE HIS RIVAL FOR THE PRESIDENCY IN THE SECOND ROUND. ACCORDING TO THE SURVEYS, THE CANDIDATES WITH THE BEST CHANCE ARE LUIS ALVA CASTRO OF THE RULING AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE , WITH 19 PERCENT OF THE VOTES; ALFONSO BARRANTES LINGAN OF THE SOCIALIST LEFT , WITH 12 PERCENT; AND HENRY PEASE OF THE COMMUNIST LEFT WING COALITION UNITED LEFT , WITH 8 PERCENT. DURING THE LAST FIVE DAYS OF THEIR CAMPAIGNS THE CANDIDATES WILL STEP UP THEIR TRIPS TO VARIOUS POINTS OF THE COUNTRY TRYING TO GAIN THE VOTES OF A LARGE UNDECIDED SECTOR OF THE POPULATION. ACCORDING TO THE SURVEYS, THIS SECTOR REPRESENTS BETWEEN 18 AND 20 PERCENT OF THE VOTES. MEANWHILE THE TERRORISTS CONTINUE ON THEIR PATH OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION. IN THE LAST 24 HOURS THE SHINING PATH MURDERED TWO STATE OFFICIALS OF THE ON A ROAD LINKING CHAVIN AND HUARI, TWO TOWNS IN ANCASH DEPARTMENT. IN HUARAZ, THE CAPITAL OF ANCASH DEPARTMENT, THE TERRORISTS SET FIRE TO THE OFFICES OF THE LOCAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION BUT INJURED NO ONE. ONE PERSON DIED WHEN AN ORE TRAIN WAS DERAILED NEAR OROYA, A KEY MINING TOWN IN THE PERUVIAN CENTRAL JUNGLE AREA, WHERE AN ELECTORAL REGISTRATION OFFICE WAS LOCATED. SEVEN PRIVATE BANK BRANCHES WERE ALSO ATTACKED AND SERIOUSLY DAMAGED IN LIMA. IN BARRANCA, A SMALL VILLAGE 180 KM FROM LIMA, TERRORISTS BOMBED A RADIO STATION AND A DRUGSTORE, BOTH OF THEM BELONGING TO SANTIAGO JAO, A FREDEMO CANDIDATE FOR DEPUTY.
TST2-MUC4-0001	CLANDESTINE, 20 NOV 89 -- WE HAVE A REPORT FROM SPAIN. AID TO EL SALVADOR HAS BEEN SUSPENDED. ATTENTION: THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT HAS SUSPENDED ITS AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT. SPANISH FOREIGN MINISTER LUIS YANEZ REPORTED TODAY THAT SPAIN HAS SUSPENDED AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT UNTIL THE KILLINGS OF THE SPANISH JESUITS, WHO HAD BEEN LIVING IN OUR COUNTRY FOR YEARS, ARE RESOLVED. THIS REPORT REPRESENTS A SERIOUS POLITICAL SETBACK FOR THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT. THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT'S DECISION FURTHER ISOLATES THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WHICH IS ALREADY UNDER PRESSURE BECAUSE OF CALLS IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SUSPENSION OF MILITARY AID. THIS SUSPENSION REPRESENTS A HALT IN THE DELIVERY OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT TO SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT. THIS REPRESENTS INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION. THE INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION OF THE CRISTIANI REGIME IS GROWING.
TST2-MUC4-0002	BUENOS AIRES, 13 DEC 89 -- LAST NIGHT, A FEW HOURS BEFORE THE CHILEAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, A VIOLENT EXPLOSION DAMAGED THE WINDOWS AND FACING OF THE SALVADORAN CONSULATE IN SANTIAGO. NO ONE WAS INJURED. A FLAG FROM THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT WAS FOUND AT THE SCENE OF THE EXPLOSION. THE FPMR IS A CLANDESTINE LEFTIST GROUP THAT PROMOTES "ALL FORMS OF STRUGGLE" AGAINST THE MILITARY GOVERNMENT HEADED BY GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET. POLICE SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT THE EXPLOSION CAUSED SERIOUS DAMAGE TO THE SALVADORAN EMBASSY BUILDING AND TO NEARBY STRUCTURES IN THE ELEGANT PROVIDENCIA NEIGHORHOOD IN EASTERN SANTIAGO. THE GOVERNMENT CHARGES THAT THE FPMR, WHICH ON 14 DECEMBER WILL MARK 6 YEARS OF SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITY, IS THE "ARMED BRANCH" OF THE OUTLAWED COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE. AS OF MIDNIGHT TONIGHT THE CARABINEROS AND POLICE AND SECURITY SERVICE AGENTS WERE CARRYING OUT AN INTENSIVE OPERATION TO ARREST THOSE RESPONISBLE FOR THE ATTACK.
TST2-MUC4-0003	SAN SALVADOR, 18 DEC 89 -- A TERRORIST ARRESTED BY THE SALVADORAN NATIONAL POLICE, HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS RUTH ESPERANZA AGUILAR MARROQUIN, AKA SANDRA. SHE HAS DESCRIBED U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CASOLO AS AN ERP MEMBER IN CHARGE OF LOGISTICS. AS HAS BEEN REPORTED, CASOLO WAS RELEASED BY A MILITARY JUDGE AFTER HE DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE AGAINST HER. SOME GROUPS, HOWEVER, ASSERT THAT CASOLO WAS RELEASED DUE TO POLITICAL PRESSURE FROM THE UNITED STATES, WHICH THREATENED TO LAUNCH A WORLDWIDE CAMPAIGN TO DISCREDIT EL SALVADOR IF CASOLO WAS NOT RELEASED. AGUILAR MARROQUIN WAS ARRESTED AT 1500 ON 9 DECEMBER AFTER HAVING PARTICIPATED IN AN ATTACK ON AN URBAN PUBLIC BUS NEAR JUAN PABLO II BOULEVARD. THE WOMAN FLED AND SOUGHT REFUGE INSIDE THE FACILITIES OF THE SALVADORAN ALBERTO MASFERRER UNIVERSITY, WHERE SHE TOOK A GROUP OF STUDENTS AS HOSTAGES, THREATENING THEM WITH HAND GRENADES. THE POLICE PREVENTED HER FROM DOING ANYTHING AND ARRESTED HER, CONFISCATING ONE .45-CALIBER PISTOL, BULLETS, CARTRIDGES, AND TWO FRAGMENTATION GRENADES. AGUILAR MARROQUIN SAID THAT SHE JOINED THE ERP LAST MARCH AND THAT SHE WAS PART OF AN URBAN COMMANDO CALLED WORKERS JUSTICE COMMAND. AGUILAR ADDED THAT SHE KNOWS U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CASOLO, WHO BELONGS TO THE ERP, AND THAT CASOLO USED TO MEET WITH TERRORIST LEADER FERNANDO, WORKERS JUSTICE COMMAND OPERATIONS CHIEF, NEAR THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY . AGUILAR ADDED THAT CASOLO WAS IN CHARGE OF ERP LOGISTICS, ESPECIALLY LODGING PEOPLE AND TRANSPORTING ARMS AND WAR EQUIPMENT. THE ERP HAD GIVEN HER TWO MINIBUSES FOR HER TO CARRY OUT HER TASKS. IN ADDITION, AGUILAR SAID THAT SHE BELIEVES CASOLO HAD A LEADING POSITION WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION, BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO MEETING WITH FERNANDO, SHE ALSO MET WITH AN INDIVIDUAL KNOWN AS MINCHO, WHO IS THE POLITICAL-MILITARY ERP METROPOLITAN CHIEF AND ALSO THE CHIEF OF THE SO-CALLED URBAN COMMANDOS. THE PRISONER KNEW ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF THE ARMS IN CASOLO'S HOUSE, BECAUSE ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS AGUILAR'S CHIEF, KNOWN AS MIRIAM, TOLD HER ABOUT IT. OTHER TERRORISTS WENT TO CASOLO'S HOUSE TO GET WEAPONS, AMMUNITION, AND EXPLOSIVES TO CONDUCT THEIR SABOTAGE OPERATIONS AGAINST BUSES, TELEPHONE DISTRIBUTION BOXES, POWER PYLONS, OR TO CONDUCT LARGE OPERATIONS--AS AGUILAR DESCRIBED THEM-- SUCH AS ATTACKS ON MILITARY GARRISONS. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION OBTAINED, THE PRISONER WILL BE SENT TO COURT OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.
TST2-MUC4-0004	LA PAZ, 20 DEC 89 -- A POWERFUL DYNAMITE CHARGE TODAY EXPLODED NEAR THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN LA PAZ. THE POLICE REPORTED THAT THE EXPLOSION CAUSED CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE TO ALL BUILDINGS ON THE BLOCK. THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED AT 2130 ON THURSDAY . IT DAMAGED WINDOWS OF THE BUILDINGS ON THE BLOCK. JOSE PARADA GRANDY, THE BOLIVIAN POLICE CHIEF, TOLD EFE THAT AN UNIDENTIFIED PERSON STEPPED OUT OF A VEHICLE AND PLACED A PACKAGE IN ONE OF THE PLANT POTS ON JUAN DE LA RIVA STREET, A FEW METERS FROM THE U.S. EMBASSY IN DOWNTOWN LA PAZ. PARADA SAID: "THE VEHICLE LEFT AND IMMEDIATELY THE CHARGE WENT OFF CAUSING CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE." THE "ZARATE WILLKA ARMED FORCES OF LIBERATION," A GROUP WITH AN INDIAN BAKCGROUND, HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK IN A COMMUNIQUE THAT WAS SENT TO SOME MEDIA. THE NOTE, SIGNED WITH THE INITIALS OF THE "ZARATE WILLKA" GROUP, STATES: "IN DEFENSE OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE. DEATH TO THE INVADER. OUR HATRED IS RELENTLESS; OUR WAR IS TO DEATH." THE "ZARATE WILLKA" GROUP CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY IN AUGUST 1988 FOR THE ATTACK AGAINST THEN U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE GEORGE SHULTZ AND THE KILLING OF TWO MORMON MISSIONARIES. TODAY'S BOMB EXPLOSION DAMAGED THE SHELVES OF A BOOK STORE, THE "PEOPLE'S PERUVIAN BANK," THE STATE BANK ; THE MARISCAL BALLIVIAN BUILDING, AND OTHER SHOPS, ALL OF WHICH ARE LOCATED NEAR THE U.S. EMBASSY. AFTER THE EXPLOSION, A GROUP OF U.S. AGENTS CALLED OFF AN INVESTIGATION AT THE SCENE OF THE INCIDENT BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE SHOUTED AT THEM, "YANKEES, OUT OF PANAMA." THE U.S. EMBASSY PRESS ATTACHE, BRUCE WARTON, SAID TODAY THAT "IT IS OBVIOUSLY A DESPICABLE ACTION THAT DOES MORE HARM TO BOLIVIANS THAN TO THE U.S. EMBASSY, BECAUSE WE HAVE SUFFERED NO DAMAGES."
TST2-MUC4-0005	SANTIAGO, 20 MAR 89 -- FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: I AM ADDRESSING YOU AFTER OUR COUNTRY HAS BEGUN TO OVERCOME, WITH EFFORT AND TENACITY, THE FIRST OBSTACLES OF A SERIOUS CRISIS, THE FUTURE IMPLICATIONS AND REPERCUSSIONS OF WHICH WE STILL DO NOT KNOW. I THEREFORE WANTED TO CONVEY A MESSAGE OF HOPE AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO EVERY CHILEAN, TO SHOW THEM MY FEELINGS AT THIS TIME OF DEEP REFLECTION. FROM THE VERY MOMENT I LEARNED ABOUT THIS TERRORIST ECONOMIC AGGRESSION, I ORDERED THE CREATION OF FOUR MINISTERIAL COMMISSIONS TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM. I ALSO SENT TWO MINISTERS TO THE UNITED STATES TO MEET WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. AFTER TIRING SESSIONS OF TALKS, THESE MINISTERS MANAGED TO OVERCOME A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE GRAPE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM AFFECTING OTHER FRUITS REMAINS TO BE SOLVED. THIS NEW ATTACK AGAINST THE CHILEAN NATION, AN ATTACK THAT DESTINY HAS PLACED IN THE NATION'S PATH OF FREEDOM, PROGRESS, AND WELL-BEING, COMPELS US TO CLOSE RANKS BEHIND THE GOVERNMENT, UNIFIED AND READY TO FIGHT -- WITH COURAGE AND HIGH SPIRIT -- THE PROBLEM THAT FACES US. ON THIS OCCASION THE COUNTRY HAS SEEN HOW THE COUNTLESS THREATS TO BOYCOTT THE NATIONAL ECONOMY HAVE WORKED. MOST OF THE TIME SUCH THREATS HAVE BEEN PROMOTED BY CERTAIN POLITICIANS, LABOR LEADERS, OR COMMUNIST LABOR UNIONS, BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO -- DRIVEN BY PERSONAL OR IDEOLOGICAL INTEREST -- HAVE CONTINUALLY JEOPARDIZED THE STABILITY OF WORKERS, OF FAMILIES, AND OF THOSE WHOM THEY DEMAGOGICALLY CALL THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN. THEY DO NOT CARE IF THEY CAUSE UNEMPLOYMENT, POVERTY, AND HUNGER TO 500,000 FELLOW CITIZENS WHO WORK IN THIS AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY. HOW SHAMELESSLY THEY MAKE CLAIMS AND DEMANDS, OFFERING THEIR SUPPORT AND THEIR SOLIDARITY WHEN CHILE IS SERIOUSLY THREATENED! YET WHEN THE DANGER IS OVER, THEY CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDE AND AGAIN LEVEL CHARGES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND CRITICIZE ITS ACTIONS. IN DOING THAT THEY FAIL TO RECALL THAT FROM ITS VERY BEGINNING THE CHILEAN NATION HAS BEEN BUILT UPON NON-NEGOTIABLE PRINCIPLES BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ESSENCE OF THE NATIONAL SOUL. GENTLEMEN: OUR WILL IS BASED ON OUR FEELING OF UNITY IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY, WHETHER FROM THE ACTION OF NATURE OR FROM THE ACTION OF TREACHEROUS, DISTURBED MINDS THAT RECOGNIZE NO MORAL VALUES, FATHERLAND, OR LAW. CHILEANS: A FEW DAYS AGO I REPORTED ON THE STEPS FORWARD IN THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION PROCESS AND ON THE PROGRESS THAT OUR COUNTRY HAS MADE IN ALL FIELDS. THE FACT THAT CYANIDE HAS BEEN INJECTED INTO TWO EXPORTED GRAPES HAS CAUSED INCALCULABLE DAMAGE TO THE ECONOMY; IT HAS ALSO BROUGHT THE SHADOW OF ANGUISH AND UNCERTAINTY TO THOUSANDS OF HOMES OF FELLOW COUNTRYMEN WHOSE JOBS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THEIR LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO A LIVELIHOOD HAVE BEEN DRAMATICALLY JEOPARDIZED. IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT SOME OFFICIALS OF IMPORTING COUNTRIES, WITHOUT WEIGHING THE TRUE EFFECTS OF THIS TYPE OF MEASURE, HAVE RESTRICTED THE IMPORT OF CHILEAN FRUITS, THUS PROVOKING FEAR AND DISTRUST ON THE INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER MARKET. GENTLEMEN, WE MUST REVERSE THIS SITUATION. WE SHOULD ONCE AGAIN ACT IN A UNITED MANNER TO RECOVER INTERNATIONAL CONFIDENCE AND OUR UNDISPUTED LEADERSHIP AS EXPORTERS. I AM SURE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED WITH A NEW JOINT EFFORT.
TST2-MUC4-0006	SAN SALVADOR, 22 APR 90 -- DEAR RADIO AUDIENCE: FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TALK TO YOU TONIGHT ABOUT A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY. MANY TIMES YOU HAVE HEARD US MENTION THE WORD SOLIDARITY. WE HAVE ALWAYS USED IT AS A WORD THAT MEANS TO THINK ABOUT THOSE WHO SUFFER THE MOST, THOSE WHO HAVE LESS. INDEED, THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WE MUST HELP, EVEN WITH OUR OWN SACRIFICE, AND MANY TIMES WITH A HUGE SACRIFICE BY ALL OF US. IF LOVE IS THE BOND THAT UNITES FAMILY MEMBERS, SOLIDARITY SHOULD BE THE GREAT PILLAR, THE CEMENT THAT UNITES SALVADORAN SOCIETY, SO THAT, UNITED, WE MAY FULFILL OUR DESIRE FOR PEACE, TRANQUILITY, HAPPINESS, AND WELL-BEING. HOWEVER, TONIGHT ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE CONSIDER SHOULD BE THE USE OF THE WORD SOLIDARITY AND WHAT THIS WORD MEANS IN MATTERS THAT ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER. A FEW WEEKS AGO THE GOVERNMENT WAS FORCED, DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OIL PRICES, TO RAISE THE PRICE OF OIL BYPRODUCTS SUCH AS GASOLINE, DIESEL, AND ALL FUELS. IN THE PAST, THE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZED GASOLINE. PERHAPS THE GOVERNMENT DID THIS TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS WOULD HAVE NOTHING BUT POSITIVE EFFECTS. HOWEVER, LET US ANALYZE FOR A WHILE THE ISSUE OF INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF FUEL. WHEN A GOVERNMENT HAS NO MONEY FOR SUBSIDIZING, THAT MEANS THE COST OF LIVING WILL GO UP. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT PRICES WILL RISE WHEN A GOVERNMENT SPENDS MORE THAN WHAT IT HAS. HOWEVER, LET US SEE HOW THIS ASPECT, OR RATHER THE PRINCIPLE OF SOLIDARITY, APPLIES TO THE INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES, ESPECIALLY THE PRICE OF GASOLINE. TEN PERCENT OF ALL FAMILIES IN OUR COUNTRY OWN A VEHICLE. IN GENERAL, THAT 10 PERCENT ARE THOSE WHO HAVE THE MOST; IN OTHER WORDS, THOSE WHO HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF BUYING A CAR, A VEHICLE. IF WE SUBSIDIZED GASOLINE, WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING IS TAKING MONEY OUT OF A GOVERNMENT THAT, FOR THE TIME BEING, DOES NOT HAVE SUCH FUNDS AVAILABLE. IN ORDER TO GET SUCH FUNDS, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO IMPOSE NEW TAXES WHICH WOULD AFFECT ALL SALVADORANS. THEREFORE, LET US THINK WHETHER OR NOT IT IS FAIR THAT 90 PERCENT OF ALL SALVADORAN FAMILIES, WHO OWN NO VEHICLES, MUST PAY SOME KIND OF TAX IN ORDER TO BENEFIT THE OTHER 10 PERCENT WHO HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT ALLOW THEM TO BUY A VEHICLE. WE DO NOT WANT TO APPEAR AS DEMAGOGIC OR POPULIST WITH THIS EXAMPLE. WHAT WE WANT TO SAY IS THAT THOSE OF US WHO OWN A VEHICLE, WHO ARE PART OF THE 10 PERCENT LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE SOMETHING AND THUS CAN BUY A VEHICLE, MUST BE IN SOLIDARITY WITH THAT 90 PERCENT WHO HAVE LITTLE AND MANY TIMES NOTHING. THEY HAVE NO VEHICLES, AND THEREFORE HAVE NO REASON TO SUFFER SO THE GASOLINE WE BUY BECOMES CHEAPER. MOREOVER, TO SOME EXTENT THE CURRENT PRICE OF GASOLINE MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR THE DIESEL SUPPLIED TO URBAN AND INTERURBAN BUS COMPANIES TO BE BOUGHT AT A PRICE THAT WILL ALLOW BUS OWNERS TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT BUS FARES. THIS IS SOLIDARITY, AND EVEN MORE THAN THAT. THOSE OF US WHO HAVE SOMETHING, WHO OWN A VEHICLE, PAY SOMETHING -- THROUGH THE PRICE OF THE GASOLINE WE CONSUME -- SO THAT THOSE WHO OWN NOTHING AND MUST USE THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION BUSES CAN DO SO WITH NO PRICE INCREASE. THE SAME SHOULD BE THE CASE FOR THE COST OF LIQUID GAS AND PROPANE GAS, SO THAT THE PRICES OF FOOD COOKED WITH GAS IN THE MARKETPLACES ARE NOT INCREASED. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THOSE OF US WHO HAVE SOMETHING CAN SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO HAVE LITTLE OR NOTHING AT ALL. I WOULD NOW LIKE TO TALK ABOUT AN EXAMPLE OF AN EVEN DEEPER KIND OF SOLIDARITY. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT PEACE. SALVADORAN BROTHERS, THIS IS THE TIME WHEN WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE MOTHERS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR SONS. WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THE INNOCENT CHILDREN WHO COULD KICK A MINE AND END UP WITHOUT AN ARM OR A LEG. WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO, BECAUSE OF VIOLENCE, CANNOT FIND A JOB. THAT IS WHY THIS IS THE TIME FOR ALL OF US TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO ACHIEVE PEACE. LAST THURSDAY I TOLD YOU I FELT MORE OPTIMISTIC AFTER MEETING WITH THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND LISTENING TO THEIR DECISION TO ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE TO WORK FOR PEACE. THEY ARE DETERMINED TO REACH A CONSENSUS TO FULFILL THE ASPIRATIONS OF ALL SALVADORANS. WE ARE BEGINNING TO SENSE WHAT THE NEAR FUTURE OF EL SALVADOR COULD BE. WE ARE FEELING HAPPY AND OPTIMISTIC. HOWEVER, I REPEAT, THIS IS THE TIME WHEN WE SHOULD ALL CONTRIBUTE TO PEACE. ANYTHING THAT MAY LEAD TO VIOLENCE, WHETHER IT IS STREET DISTURBANCES OR BOMBS, SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED, BECAUSE IT IS NO LONGER CONCEIVABLE FOR MOTHERS, CHILDREN, AND FAMILIES TO CONTINUE TO SUFFER IN OUR COUNTRY. THE TIME HAS COME TO SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY, TO SEARCH, NOT ONLY THROUGH WORDS BUT ALSO THROUGH OUR EXAMPLES AND ACTIONS, FOR THE PEACE THAT OUR COUNTRY AND SALVADORANS DESERVE. THEREFORE, OUR SOLIDARITY SHOULD BE THE FUNDAMENTAL TOOL FOR OUR COUNTRY'S RECONSTRUCTION. IT SHOULD BE THE FUNDAMENTAL TOOL FOR THE PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL RECONSTRUCTION OF ALL SALVADORANS. WE WANT ALL SALVADORANS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, TO SUPPORT THE PEACE EFFORTS, SO THAT THOSE WHO SUFFER SO VERY MUCH FROM VIOLENCE WILL NO LONGER SUFFER. THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL STEP FORWARD FOR THE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. SALVADORAN BROTHERS, LET US SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY IN THIS CRUCIAL TIME IN OUR HISTORY, BECAUSE WE HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT WHEN ALL SALVADORANS ACT POSITIVELY LIKE BROTHERS, WE CAN COME OUT AHEAD. THIS IS ALL FOR TONIGHT. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND MAY GOD BLESS YOU.
TST2-MUC4-0007	MEDELLIN, 12 APR 90 -- MEDELLIN MAYOR JUAN GOMEZ MARTINEZ ONCE MORE INSISTED TODAY ON "AN IMMEDIATE DIALOGUE" BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE COCAINE TRAFFICKERS "TO END THE WAR IN WHICH INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE BEING KILLED." THE MAYOR REITERATED HIS POSITION WHEN HE COMMENTED ON THE ATTACK IN WHICH 20 PERSONS WERE KILLED AND APPROXIMATELY 100 WERE INJURED, WHICH WAS PERPETRATED YESTERDAY BY TERRORISTS ON THE DRUG CARTEL'S PAYROLL NEAR ITAGUI MUNICIPALITY. THE BLAST FROM THE EXPLOSION HIT A TRUCK FULL OF POLICEMEN, WHO HAD EARLIER CARRIED OUT AN ANTI-MAFIA OPERATION IN A PEASANT VILLAGE, AS WELL AS SEVERAL PUBLIC BUSES, HOUSES, AND BUSINESSES. A POLICE EXPERT SAID THAT THE CAR BOMB WAS ACTIVATED BY REMOTE CONTROL AS THE ELITE FORCE PATROL PASSED BY. ACCORDING TO GOMEZ MARTINEZ, "THESE ACTIONS WILL ONLY CEASE WHEN GOVERNMENT PUTS ASIDE SO MUCH PREJUDICE AND AGREES TO THE PEACE TALKS," PROPOSED BY THE SUBVERSIVES. "THE DIALOGUE WILL TAKE PLACE SONNER OR LATER, AND IT IS BETTER TO START NOW," INSISTED THE MAYOR OF MEDELLIN, A CITY WHERE THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL CARTEL HAS ITS BASE OF OPERATIONS. THE CHIEF OF THE CRIMINAL GANG, PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, ORDERED THE ASSASSINATION OF MEDELLIN POLICEMEN IN RETALIATION FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTION AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS. TWENTY-EIGHT POLICEMEN HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THIS CITY OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS. ACCORDING TO SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS, YESTERDAY'S ATTACK "COULD BE ESCOBAR GAVIRIA'S RESPONSE TO THE ARREST OF ADOLFO MESA MENESES," HIS RIGHT-HAND MAN. MESA MENESES WAS ARRESTED LAST WEEK BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY , AND THE AUTHORITIES HAVE ACCUSED HIM OF ASSASSINATING -- ON ORDERS FROM THE MAFIA LEADER -- LEFTIST PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA, AS WELL AS A CHIEF OF POLICE, A MAYOR, AND SEVERAL JOURNALISTS. MEANWHILE, HUNDREDS OF SOLDIERS, POLICEMEN, AND DETECTIVES ARE CARRYING OUT LARGE-SCALE OPERATIONS IN THE COLOMBIAN COUNTRYSIDE AND BORDER AREAS ON THE SUSPICION THAT ESCOBAR GAVIRIA PLANS TO FLEE THE COUNTRY. LAST NIGHT, A TELEVISION NEWSCAST SHOWED PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE "DRUG LORD" THAT HAD BEEN "RECENTLY" TAKEN BY SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS AT A COLOMBIAN BEACH ON THE PACIFIC COAST. A POLICE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN CONFIRMED TODAY THAT "WE HAVE RELIABLE INFORMATION ON HIS WHEREABOUTS," ALTHOUGH HE REFRAINED FROM GIVING FURTHER DETAILS. UNOFFICIAL SOURCES SAID THAT ESCOBAR GAVIRIA "IS SOMEWHERE IN WESTERN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT" -- OF WHICH MEDELLIN IS THE CAPITAL -- WHERE THE SEARCH OPERATIONS ARE CONCENTRATED. COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE ALSO ASKED FOR THE COOPERATION OF BRAZIL, ECUADOR, PANAMA, PERU, AND VENEZUELA TO STOP THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS FROM ESCAPING TO THOSE COUNTRIES.
TST2-MUC4-0008	CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 -- WE HAVE STARTED A NEW DAY, THE SEVENTH, AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT IS STILL HOLDING ITS POSITIONS. WE HAVE NOT RETREATED A SINGLE STEP. IF WE MAKE ANY MOVE, IT WILL BE TO ADVANCE TOWARD THE ENEMY BARRACKS, BECAUSE WE WILL SEIZE POWER AND EXPEL THE MILITARY DICTATORSHIP THAT HAS INSTALLED ITSELF IN OUR HOMELAND. THE FMLN MAINTAINS FOR THE 7TH DAY ITS POSITIONS IN THE DEPARTMENTAL CAPITALS. WE CONTINUE TO ADVANCE IN SAN MIGUEL; WE HAVE MADE AN IMPORTANT SEIZURE OF WEAPONS IN SAN MIGUEL. THE SITUATION COULD NOT BE BETTER IN SAN SALVADOR. LAST NIGHT WE REPORTED THAT THE ARCH OF LIBERTY EXISTS IN THE CAPITAL; IT IS COMPRISED OF NEIGHBORHOODS AND HOUSING PROJECTS -- WHERE THE PROTAGONISTS OF THIS HISTORY ARE THE MASSES, WHICH ARE ORGANIZED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF TRENCHES AND BARRICADES. THE PEOPLE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PROTAGONISTS IN THIS HISTORIC ACTION. RADIO VENCEREMOS URGES THE PEOPLE TO MULTIPLY THEIR ORGANIZATION IN EACH NEIGHBORHOOD, RESIDENTIAL AREA, AND TOWN. POPULAR COMMITTEES MUST BE ORGANIZED; THE PEOPLE MUST ORGANIZE THEMSELVES; BUT IF THE ENEMY IS NEAR, THIS MUST BE DONE CLANDESTINELY. ALL THE GROUPS IN EACH TOWN, MEANING THE RELIGIOUS GROUPS, STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS, TEACHERS ORGANIZATIONS, AND COOPERATIVES, MUST ALL ORGANIZE, REGARDLESS OF THEIR POLITICAL BELIEFS. OUR UNITY MUST BECOME THE BEST TOOL TO EVICT, ONCE AND FOR ALL, THE MURDEROUS MILITARY DICTATORSHIP WHICH ASSASSINATES PRIESTS AND WHICH BOMBED THE CAPITAL AGAIN EARLY THIS MORNING. IT HAS AGAIN CAUSED MORE DEATHS AND WOUNDED IN SAN SALVADOR. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE PEOPLE TO ORGANIZE COMMITTEES IN EACH NEIGHBORHOOD, RESIDENTIAL AREA, AND TOWN, AND THE WHOLE COMMUNITY MUST PARTICIPATE. IF THE ARMED FORCES ARE NEAR, THEN CLANDESTINE ORGANIZATION MUST BE CONDUCTED IN SMALL TOWNS, VILLAGES, AND NEIGHBORHOODS. THE PEOPLE MUST ORGANIZE THEMSELVE TO CONSPIRE AGAINST DEATH, TO CONSPIRE AGAINST THE ASSASSINS, TO CONSPIRE AGAINST POVERTY, TO CONSPIRE AGAINST HUNGER, AND TO CONSPIRE AGAINST THE BOMBINGS. IT IS NECESSARY TO ORGANIZE THE PEOPLE; IT IS NECESSARY TO ORGANIZE THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. EL SALVADOR MUST BECOME A BODY COMPRISED OF ORGANIZED CELLS -- EVERYWHERE AND IN EVERY POSSIBLE FORM -- REGARDLESS OF THE PEOPLE'S RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OR POLITICAL PARTY. WE ISSUE AN APPEAL TO THE DECEIVED ARENA RANK AND FILE, WHO VOTED BELIEVING THAT THIS GOVERNMENT WOULD REPRESENT A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER. WE ALSO ISSUE AN APPEAL TO ALL THE PATRIOTIC CITIZENS OF THE HOMELAND, URGING THEM TO STOP THE DESTRUCTION OF THE CAPITAL, TO STOP THE DESTRUCTION OF THE COUNTRY. WE URGE THEM TO UNITE AND STOP THE WAR; AND THE END OF THE WAR IS NEAR -- WITH THE PEOPLE'S VICTORY.
TST2-MUC4-0009	RIO DE JANEIRO , NO DATE -- LAWYER CARLOS OLDINEY REPORTED THE GANG AND FEDERAL AGENTS VALDEMIR LOPEZ PRAZERES AND LUIS JOSE DA CONCEICAO AND DETECTIVES PAULO MASSANHYO AND CARLOS ANGEL SERRANO CASTILESSO WERE ARRESTED. CAMBARALAMAIA'S ORGANIZATION IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY GANGS IN THE REGION THAT DEALS WITH BOLIVIAN COCAINE. ANOTHER GANG IS LED BY GERSON PALERMO, OF UMUARAMA, PARANA STATE, WHO CONTROLS THE EXCHANGE OF COCAINE TO PARAGUAY FOR STOLEN BRAZILIAN CARS. PALERMO OWNS FOUR TWIN-ENGINED CESSNA PLANES AND EMPLOYS MORE THAN 200 MEN. HE ALSO EXCHANGE CARS FOR COCAINE IN BOLIVIA. ALTHOUGH SENTENCED BY THE BRAZILIAN COURTS, PALERMO LIVES IN PEDRO JUAN CABALLERO, PARAGUAY, WHERE HE MAINTAINS BUSINESS CONTACTS WITH THE BOLIVIAN COCA PRODUCERS. PALERMO OBTAINS ETHER AND ACETONE, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR REFINING THE DRUG, FROM ARGENTINA. THE FEDERAL POLICE BELIEVES THAT THE DRUG MIGHT BE REFINED IN MATO GROSSO DO SUL, NEAR SOME RESIDENCES IN THE DOURADOS AND CAMPO GRANDE SECTORS. PALERMO EXCHANGES THE CHEMICALS FOR TONS OF COCAINE PASTE WHICH, IN THE OPINION OF REGIONAL FEDERAL POLICE DELEGATE FRANCISCO VIANA QUEIROZ, IS ALSO PROCESSED IN PARAGUAY. VIANA QUEIROZ MAINTAINS THAT THE DRUG IS REFINED BY A GROUP OF TRAFFICKERS LED BY ARSENIO BENITEZ GONZALEZ, WHO IS KNOWN AS VILHAR AND WHO LIVES IN ASUNCION. THE FEDERAL POLICE BELIEVE THAT VILHAR -- WHO IS BELIEVED TO BE PALERMO'S PARTNER -- IS THE BRAZILIAN TRAFFICKERS' MAIN COCAINE SUPPLIER. ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, TWO DRUG ROUTES PASS THROUGH MATO GROSSO DO SUL: THE PONTA PORA ROUTE , AND THE CORUMBA ROUTE, WHICH PASSES THROUGH THE BOLIVIAN TOWN OF PUERTO SUAREZ. MANY TRAFFICKERS COME TO THIS BOLIVIAN TOWN, MOST OF THEM SMALL SUPPLIERS WHO ONLY WANT TO EXCHANGE COCAINE FOR CARS THAT WERE STOLEN IN BRAZIL. ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES, THE CORUMBA ROUTE IS MORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT CHANNELS THE SO-CALLED "MINI-TRAFFIC." THIS INVOLVES HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO, TOGETHER, MAKE UP A SIZABLE QUANTITY OF DRUGS EVERY DAY. THE CARS ARE THE HARD CURRENCY USED IN THESE TRANSACTIONS. MOST OF THEM ARE TAKEN TO BOLIVIA AFTER HAVING BEEN STOLEN IN SAO PAULO. THEY FOLLOW THE SAME ROUTE AS THE BOLIVIAN COCAINE, THAT IS, VIA PUERTO SUAREZ. THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE TRAFFICKING, HOWEVER, IS CARRIED OUT IN PARAGUAY AND BOLIVIA. GERSON PALERMO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PART OF IT, WHILE THE REST IS SHARED BY HUNDREDS OF BOLIVIAN TRAFFICKERS. PALERMO OBTAINS ETHER AND ACETONE FROM FORMOSA, ARGENTINA. HE TAKES THESE CHEMICALS ABOARD SMALL PLANES TO THE TOWNS OF PILAR OR ENCARNACION, IN PARAGUAY. FROM THERE, ANOTHER GROUP TAKES THE 200-LITER DRUMS ALONG THE CHACO HIGHWAY TO PUERTO GUARANI, IN BOLIVIA. BOLIVIAN TRAFFICKERS TAKE CARE OF THE REST OF THE JOURNEY TO SANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA. IN RETURN, PALERMO RECEIVES COCAINE PASTE WHICH IS SHIPPED TO ASUNCION AND, FROM THERE, TO PEDRO JUAN CABALLERO FOR DISTRIBUTION TO THE PROCESSING UNITS. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE TRAFFICKERS USE SOME RANCHES NEAR PORTO MURTINHO , NEAR THE PARAGUAYAN TOWN OF BAHIA NEGRA, TO PROCESS LARGE QUANTITIES OF COCAINE. NO COCAINE PASTE IS USUALLY AVAILABLE ALONG THE CORUMBA ROUTE. THE DRUG IS REFINED BECAUSE IT IS RELATIVELY EASY TO FIND ETHER AND ACETONE IN CORUMBA, WHERE THE FEDERAL POLICE HAVE FAILED TO REDUCE THE LARGE DEMAND FOR SUCH CHEMICALS IN RETAIL STORES. DOZENS OF DRUGSTORES SELL THOSE PRODUCTS BY THE LITER, AND THIS IS NOT FORBIDDEN BY LAW. THE AUTHORITIES ESTIMATE THAT PRODUCTION IN THE PUERTO SUAREZ REGION NEARS 300 KG PER WEEK, WHICH IS TRANSPORTED BY RAILROAD, AIR, AND LAND. IN AN ATTEMPT TO EVADE THE FEDERAL POLICE, TRAFFICKERS HAVE TRIED TO TRANSPORT THE DRUG INSIDE THEIR BODIES, IN WINE DEMIJOHNS, AND EVEN IN CHILDREN'S DIAPERS. THESE TRAFFICKERS GENERALLY TRAVEL BY BUS OR BY TRAIN. OVER THE PAST 6 MONTHS THE POLICE CAUGHT DOZENS OF TRAFFICKERS USING THESE METHODS. NOW, HOWEVER, ONLY WITH THE COMPLICITY OF THE POLICE CAN CARS CARRYING BOLIVIAN COCAINE PRODUCED IN THE PUERTO SUAREZ REGION REACH CAMPO GRANDE.
TST2-MUC4-0010	NO CITY, NO DATE -- MR. PRESIDENT, WHEN ONE SEES PERU FACING THE DIFFICULTIES IT IS EXPERIENCING NOW, THE SAME AS OUR OWN COUNTRY AND LATIN AMERICA IN GENERAL, ONE ASKS HIMSELF: WOULD A MAN, A NOVELIST LIKE MARIO VARGAS LLOSA, BE THE RIGHT MAN TO LEAD PERU? AS PRESIDENT OF ALL PERUVIANS -- AND OF VARGAS LLOSA TO EVEN IF HE DOES NOT LIKE IT -- I CANNOT PASS JUDGMENT, EITHER ETHICALLY OR INTELLECTUALLY, ON A POLITICIAN AND PERUVIAN WHO IS CONTENDING FOR THE PRESIDENCY. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO AFTER YOU STEP DOWN FROM THE PRESIDENCY? WELL, I AM GOING TO BE FREE. WHY DO YOU NOT COME TO COLOMBIA AND I AM SURE... SURE, I ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION, AND I HOPE SOME COLOMBIANS WILL EXTEND IT. HOWEVER, I WANT TO TELL YOU VERY HONESTLY, THAT I AM PERHAPS BETTER AT SELLING DREAMS, IDEAS, AND DOCTRINES THAN AT ADMINISTERING A SITUATION OF PENURY, LIKE THE ONE OUR COUNTRIES ARE EXPERIENCING, AND MOST PARTICULARLY PERU, WHICH IS ONE OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT. FOR INSTANCE, ON A DAY WHEN THE PRICE OF RICE OR CHICKEN GOES UP, THE PEOPLE WILL NOT BELIEVE YOU, EVEN IF YOU TELL THEM THE GREATEST OF TRUTHS. ONE CAN BE PREACHING SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT, BUT IF IT FAILED TO RAIN AND THE CITY HAD NO WATER NO ONE WILL BELIEVE OF YOU THE GREATEST OF ALL TRUTHS. THEN, WHEN ONE STOPS BEING PRESIDENT AND ADMINISTERING PENURY, ONE CAN DEVOTE ONESELF TO CONVINCING PEOPLE, TO EDUCATING. THAT IS WHAT I SHOULD DO. NOW, WHY DID YOU MAKE THAT ASIDE, MAKING ME PRESIDENT OF ALL PERUVIANS, EVEN OF VARGAS LLOSA? WHETHER HE LIKES OR NOT IT HURTS HIM. BECAUSE I AM SURE THAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD NOT LIKE TO HAVE ME AS PRESIDENT. EVEN HIM, FOR INSTANCE? I DID NOT SAY SO. I DO NOT KNOW. I NEVER FALL TO THE LEVEL OF DEFINING PEOPLE OR POINTING OUT LAST NAMES. I MAKE AN OUTLINE OR DEFINE THEM IN THE NEGATIVE. MR. PRESIDENT, THIS DIALOGUE FOR YOUR GENEROSITY AND KINDNESS. ADDRESSING OUR PEOPLE AND OUR COUNTRY, , HOW WERE THINGS TODAY AT THE SUMMIT? VERY WELL. COLOMBIANS, WHO HAVE SEEN THEIR INSTITUTION THREATENED, THEIR PRESS ABUSED, AND MANY POLITICIANS ALSO THREATENED, MUST HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT LATIN AMERICA, TOGETHER WITH THE UNITED STATES, WILL CONFRONT THE PROBLEM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING. THIS IS NOT ONLY A PROBLEM FOR COLOMBIA. IT IS OUR PROBLEM TOO, AND WE WILL TACKLE IT. THE DAY A NEWSPAPER WAS BLOWN UP IN BOGOTA I CAME TO BOGOTA BECAUSE I FELT THAT FREEDOM OF THE PRESS WAS THREATENED ON THE CONTINENT. AFTER ALL, WE ARE LATIN AMERICANS. LET COLOMBIANS HAVE CONFIDENCE.
TST2-MUC4-0011	SAN SALVADOR, 7 FEB 90 -- THE CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF HAS CATEGORICALLY DENIED THAT THERE ARE ANY RIFTS BETWEEN SALVADORAN ARMY OFFICERS AND U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS, AS ASSERTED BY THE WASHINGTON POST. THE NEWSPAPER STATED THAT THE ALLEGED RIFT BETWEEN THE MILITARY OFFICERS BEGAN ONCE IT WAS DISCOVERED WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS, IN WHICH ONE COLONEL, TWO LIEUTENANTS, AND SIX SOLDIERS ARE BEING CHARGED. COLONEL PONCE SAID THAT THE RELATIONS WITH U.S. ADVISERS -- ABOUT 52 IN THE COUNTRY -- ARE VERY CORDIAL. OUR RELATIONS WITH THE NORTH AMERICANS ARE NORMAL AS USUAL. THE U.S. ADVISERS HAVE HELPED US VERY MUCH IN THE PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE ARMED FORCES, AND THEY CONTINUE WORKING WITH US. WHERE DO YOU THINK THESE WIRE REPORTS STATING THERE ARE RIFTS BETWEEN SALVADORAN MILITARY OFFICERS AND U.S. ADVISERS HAVE ORGINIATED? I DO NOT KNOW; I CANNOT UNDERSTAND. THERE ARE ALWAYS THOSE WHO TRY TO BREAK THE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES AND THE UNITED STATES. THIS IS A POOR COUNTRY THAT DEPENDS A GREAT DEAL ON U.S. ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID. FOLLOWING THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS, WHAT ARE RELATIONS LIKE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN MILITARY AND THE GRINGO ADVISERS? AS USUAL, THESE RELATIONS ARE VERY CORDIAL, AND THEY CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US. AS YOU CAN SEE, TWO ADVISERS ARE HERE WITH ME NOW AT THE TABLE PRESIDING OVER THE EVENT. THE SAME HAS BEEN THE CASE WITH ALL THE UNITS IN THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR. I FAIL TO SEE ANY DIFFERENCE IN RELATIONS BEFORE AND AFTERWARD. THE MILITARY CHIEF REPEATED THE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE STATE OF EMERGENCY, NOT ONLY DUE TO THE GUERRILLA ATTACKS, BUT ALSO TO KEEP CONTROL OVER THE ORGANIZATION FRONTS JUST PRIOR TO AN EXPECTED WAVE OF PROTESTS ON THE LATEST GOVERNMENT ECONOMY MEASURES. WE MUST START THINKING WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO DOMESTIC ORDER IN THE FACE OF THE ECONOMIC MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED OR ARE PLANNED. WE MUST THINK WHAT THE REACTION OF THE PEOPLE OR THE FMLN ORGANIZATION FRONTS WILL BE, AS THEY ALWAYS USE ANY EXCUSE TO DISRUPT DOMESTIC ORDER. IT WOULD BE GOOD TO LOOK INTO WHAT IS NEEDED TO MAINTAIN DOMESTIC ORDER IN THE COUNTRY. THE HIGH-RANKING MILITARY OFFICER GAVE THESE STATEMENTS AT THE CEREMONY TO TURN OVER COMMAND OF THE CAPTAIN GENERAL GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY. THE NEW COMMANDER IS COLONEL RICARDO ALFONSO CASANOVA SANDOVAL, WHO REPLACES COLONEL GUILLERMO ALFREDO BENAVIDES MORENO, REMOVED FROM HIS POST AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF ORDERING THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS. MEANWHILE, COLONEL HECTOR HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ HAS BEEN APPOINTED COMMANDER OF THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE BASED IN USULUTAN, AND IN LA UNION DEPARTMENT THE CHANGE OF COMMAND CEREMONIES OF THE ARMED FORCES MILITARY TRAINING CENTER HAVE TAKEN PLACE, WHERE COLONEL FRANCISCO ARTURO LOPEZ WILL BE IN COMMAND REPLACING COLONEL CARLOS ALFREDO RIVAS, WHO HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF.
TST2-MUC4-0012	SANTIAGO, 6 SEP 89 -- THE SUPREME COURT TODAY ORDERED THE APPOINTEMENT OF A SPECIAL JUDGE TO INVESTIGATE THE MURDER OF JECAR NEGHME, SPOKESMAN OF THE MIR . IN RESPONSE TO THIS ORDER, THE SANTIAGO APPELLATE COURT HAS APPOINTED JUDGE CARLOS MENESES PIZARRO TO INVESTIGATE THE CRIME AND TO SEND ALL INFORMATION FROM THE FOURTH CRIMINAL COURT OF SANTIAGO. THE SUPREME COURT ORDERED THE INVESTIGATION AS A RESULT OF THE PUBLIC ALARM OVER THE MURDER OF JECAR NEGHME ON A STREET IN SANTIAGO.
TST2-MUC4-0013	QUITO, 30 APR 90 -- THIS AFTERNOON, ON THE BERMEJA RIVER, SUCUMBIOS PROVINCE, IN NORTHEASTERN ECUADOR, AT APPROXIMATELY ONE AND A HALF KM FROM THE COLOMBIAN BORDER, A SMALL ECUADORAN FLAGSHIP WORKING WITH THE IMANCO MINING COMPANY, WAS INTERCEPTED BY A COLOMBIAN VESSEL WHICH FIRED AUTOMATIC WEAPONS. THE FOLLOWING PEOPLE WERE ABOARD THE ECUADORAN FLAGSHIP: U.S. CITIZEN SCOTT HEYNDAL, ECUADOREANS LUIS ANTONIO MENESES BENAVIDES AND EDWIN RODRIGO TENEDA PARRENO, AND COLOMBIAN PILOT JULIO TORRES. MR. TORRES WAS KILLED AND MR. MENESES WAS WOUNDED. THE ATTACKERS, WHO WORE FIELD UNIFORMS OF THE COLOMBIAN MILITARY, BOARDED THE ECUADORAN VESSEL, AND, AFTER NOTICING THAT MR. MENESES WAS WOUNDED, GAVE HIM 100,000 COLOMBIAN PESOS AND THEN LEFT HIM AND MR. TORRES' BODY. THE ATTACKERS RETURNED TO COLOMBIA TAKING HEYNDAL AND TENEDA WITH THEM. THEY CROSSED THE BORDER AND SAILED UPRIVER FOR ABOUT TWO AND A HALF HOURS ON THE RUMIYACU RIVER. THE ATTACKERS SPENT THE EVENING AT A CAMP NEAR THE RIVER AND FORCED MR. HEYNDAL TO WRITE LETTERS TO HIS BOSS AT THE MINING PROJECT, MR. JEFF SINO, ALSO A U.S. CITIZEN, AND TO HIS WIFE. THOSE LETTERS WERE GIVEN TO MR. TENEDA, WHO RECEIVED 20,000 COLOMBIAN PESOS. HE WAS THEN ORDERED TO RETURN TO ECUADOR AND GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS FOR DELIVERING THE LETTERS.
TST2-MUC4-0014	CLANDESTINE, 14 NOV 89 -- FIGHTING RAGED ALL DAY LONG IN THE AREA AROUND SAN TERESA HOSPITAL, IN ZACATELUCA, LA PAZ DEPARTMENT. A REPORT SAYS THAT A DMIFA ARMED FORCES ENGINEERS' MILITARY DETACHMENT UNIT WAS AT SANTA TERESA HOSPITAL, AND THAT THE ENTIRE UNIT WAS WIPED OUT. THE SOLDIERS HAD A COMMUNICATIONS RELAY STATION IN THE BUILDING. AS A RESULT OF THE ATTACK, THERE WERE 20 CASUALTIES. AMONG THE CASUALTIES IS A LIEUTENANT WHO WAS THE UNIT CHIEF, AND TWO SERGEANTS. THE COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT WAS TOTALLY DESTROYED. THE SITUATION IS NOT AS THE FASCIST CRISTIANI REPORTED IT TO BE. HE SAID THERE WAS ONLY ONE SOLDIER AT THE HOSPITAL RECEIVING MEDICAL TREATMENT. THAT IS TOTALLY FALSE. THE BUILDING HOUSED A GARRISON NOT A HOSPITAL, BECAUSE A DMIFA UNIT AND A COMMUNICATIONS RELAY CENTER WERE THERE. IT WAS A GARRISON. WE ARE GOING TO CORRECT OUR REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF THE ATTACK ON THE DMIFA UNIT: 20 SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AND 10 WERE WOUNDED. IN ALL, THERE WERE 30 CASUALTIES, INCLUDING TWO SERGEANTS AND THE UNIT CHIEF. WE REPEAT: IN AN IMPRESSIVE ATTACK ON A MILITARY POSITION AT SANTA TERESA HOSPITAL--THE BUILDING WAS NO LONGER A HOSPITAL BUT AN ARMY COMMUNICATIONS CENTER--OUR FIGTHTERS ANNIHILATED AND DESTROYED THAT POSITION. THE ARMY SUSTAINED 20 KILLED AND 10 WOUNDED. THE COMMUNICATIONS RELAY STATION WAS TOTALLY DESTROYED.
TST2-MUC4-0015	MEDELLIN, 27 AUG 89 -- TODAY, MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA'S SECOND LARGEST CITY, ONCE AGAIN EXPERIENCED A TERRORIST ESCALATION WHEN SEVEN BANK BRANCH OFFICES WERE SHAKEN BY EXPLOSIVES THAT CAUSED HEAVY DAMAGE BUT NO FATALITIES, ACCORDING TO RADIO REPORTS BROADCAST IN BOGOTA . THE TARGETS OF THE ATTACKS WERE THE BANCO CAFETERO BRANCHES AND ITS OFFICES IN MEDELLIN'S MIDDLE, WESTERN, AND SOUTHEASTERN AREAS. ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY REPORTS, OVER 55 KG OF DYNAMITE WERE USED IN THE ATTACKS. THE RADIO REPORT ADDED THAT THE POLICE DEFUSED ANOTHER 20 KG OF EXPLOSIVES THAT HAD SLOW BURNING FUSES. THE MEDELLIN CARTEL OPERATES IN THIS CITY LOCATED IN COLOMBIA'S NORTHEASTERN AREA. FOR SEVERAL DAYS NOW, THE CITY HAS BEEN SHAKEN BY ARMY AND POLICE OPERATIONS IN AN UNPRECEDENTED ACTION TO CAPTURE DRUG LORDS. NO ONE HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TERRORIST ATTACKS, WHICH LASTED FOR 1 HOUR.
TST2-MUC4-0016	SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 90 -- ALTHOUGH IT ORGANICALLY DEPENDS ON THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, THE COMMISSION IS AN OFFICIAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATION AND THE JUDGE CAN INSTRUCT IT OR REQUEST THAT IT INVESTIGATE X, Y, OR Z, IN ADDITION TO WHAT IT SUBMITTED WHEN THE CASE WAS PASSED OVER TO THE JUDGE. PABLO GUILLERMO . MR. PRESIDENT, THE NEWSPAPER LA JORNADA OF MEXICO STATED YESTERDAY THAT COLONEL ORLANDO ZEPEDA HAD LEFT THE COUNTRY THIS WEEKEND WITH ALL HIS FAMILY AND WITH A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF LUGGAGE, WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT HE DID NOT GO ON A MERE VACATION. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE OFFICIAL VERSION OF THIS. YOU SAY HE LEFT WHEN? YESTERDAY. WELL, ONLY IF HE LEFT VERY HURRIEDLY AFTER MIDDAY. I WAS WITH HIM HERE YESTERDAY DISCUSSING OTHER THINGS, AS WELL AS MILITARY MATTERS WITH THE DEFENSE MINISTER AND DEPUTY MINISTERS. HE WAS PRESENT. UNLESS HE MAY HAVE LEFT. I DOUBT IT VERY MUCH, BECAUSE I HAD A MEETING WITH THEM TO SEE THE ORDER OF THE MONTH ON SATURDAY AND HE WAS PRESENT. PARDON ME, THAT WAS TUESDAY WHEN WE HAD THE ORDER FOR THE END OF THE MONTH. I UNDERSTAND HE WAS PRESENT AT THE COMMANDERS MEETING. IF HE LEFT LAST WEEKEND, IT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR THE WEEKEND AND HE RETURNED ON MONDAY. MARIA CORTINA, NOTIMEX. MR. PRESIDENT, IN WHAT WAY WOULD A CUT IN MILITARY AID AFFECT THE PEACE PROCESS? WE ARE CURRENTLY SEEING OPPOSITE SIGNS FROM THE FMLN IN TERMS OF WANTING TO TRULY PUT AN END TO VIOLENCE. A SIGN OF THIS WAS THE NIGHT OF 1 MAY WHEN THE ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT. THIS WOULD INDICATE THAT, ALTHOUGH NOT ALL THE FMLN COMMAND, THAT IS THE FIVE GROUPS, SOME GROUPS SEEM TO RESIST A POLITICAL SOLUTION AND FAVOR A MILITARY SOLUTION, AS THEY HAVE INSISTED ON PURSUING FOR 10 YEARS. THOSE GROUPS COULD VIEW A CUT IN MILITARY AID AS A SIGN OF WEAKENING OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES, AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY THEY WOULD HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF BEING SUCCESSFUL FOLLOWING THE MILITARY PATH. THAT COULD INCREASE THE POTENTIAL OF A MILITARY SOLUTION IN THE MINDS OF SOME. THIS COULD REDUCE THE POTENTIAL OF SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT. RAUL MONGE, CADENA RADIO CENTRO. MR. PRESIDENT, HOW DO YOU VIEW THE GUERRILLAS' MORALE AT THIS MOMENT? WELL, I OBVIOUSLY CANNOT BUT BELIEVE THAT THE MORALE OF THE GUERRILLAS AFTER THE OFFENSIVE MUST HAVE DROPPED CONSIDERBLY. THIS IS ESPECIALLY SO SINCE THERE WAS A LARGE SACRIFICE ON THEIR PART IN THE FORM OF CASUALTIES AND THE FACT THAT THE OFFENSIVE DID NOT REPRESENT A SUCCESS, DESPITE THEIR CLAIM THAT IT WAS ONLY A SHOW OF FORCE, WHICH IS A LOT OF MALARKEY. ALL THE PRIOR DOCUMENTS INDICATED THAT THIS WAS A LARGE-SCALE OPERATION TO THE HILT SEEKING TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT AND TO CROWN A MILITARY VICTORY. WHAT I BELIEVE WAS OF EVEN GREATER IMPACT WAS THAT THEY REALIZED THAT THE PEOPLE OF EL SALVADOR DO NOT SUPPORT THEM AND DO NOT SUPPORT THE PATH OF VIOLENCE. IN THAT SENSE, THEIR HOPES OF A POPULAR INSURRECTION WERE SHATTERED. ON THE CONTRARY, THE PEOPLE DID NOT SUPPORT THE FMLN AND INSTEAD TURNED THEIR BACKS ON THEM AND SHOWED THAT THEY DO NOT SUPPORT VIOLENCE. THIS MUST HAVE CAUSED AN IMPACT ON THE FMLN AND ITS MEMBERS. I RECENTLY READ IN A VENEZUELAN NEWSPAPER STATEMENTS BY A COMMANDER, WHOSE PSEUDONYM IS GUSTAVO, WHO SAID THAT THEY WERE TIRED OF FOLLOWING THE PATH OF VIOLENCE AND THAT A SOLUTION HAD TO BE FOUND. THIS DEMONSTRATES THAT SOME OF THEIR RANKS ARE GETTING TIRED OF THE MILITARY PATH. THESE ARE INDICATIONS OF WHAT COULD BE. WHAT I WANT TO CLEAR UP ONCE AND FOR ALL IS THAT WE DO NOT REACT TO WHETHER OR NOT THE FMLN FEELS STRONG OR FEELS WEAK. WE KNOW THAT 100 TERRORISTS IN A COUNTRY CAN CAUSE DESTRUCTION AND DEATH AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO AVOID, ALTHOUGH 100 TERRORISTS ARE NOT A FORCE THAT WILL DESTABILIZE A GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER, THE DAMAGE THAT THEY CAUSE IS SUCH THAT WE DO NOT WANT IT TO CONTINUE.
TST2-MUC4-0017	TOKYO , 8 DEC 89 -- COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS CUT SHORT HIS STAY IN JAPAN AND LEFT FOR HOME FRIDAY MORNING FOLLOWING A TRUCK-BOMB EXPLOSION IN THE COLOMBIAN CAPITAL OF BOGOTA ON WEDNESDAY. BARCO, THE FIRST HEAD OF STATE OF COLOMBIA TO VISIT JAPAN, WAS INITIALLY SCHEDULED TO DEPART FROM TOKYO FRIDAY EVENING, ENDING HIS FOUR-DAY OFFICIAL VISIT. A TRUCK RIGGED WITH DYNAMITE EXPLODED WEDNESDAY MORNING OUTSIDE A FEDERAL POLICE BUILDING IN DOWNTOWN BOGOTA, KILLING AT LEAST 23 PEOPLE AND INJURING 1,000, ACCORDING TO REPORTS FROM COLOMBIA. DURING HIS-FOUR DAY STAY IN JAPAN, BARCO MET PRIME MINISTER TOSHIKI KAIFU AND HAD AN AUDIENCE WITH EMPEROR AKIHITO. KAIFU AND BARCO AGREED THAT THE WHOLE WORLD MUST FIGHT AGAINST THE DRUG PROBLEM AND KAIFU EXPRESSED HIS SUPPORT FOR BARCO IN DEALING WITH THE ISSUE.
TST2-MUC4-0018	CLANDESTINE, 12 NOV 89 -- WE ARE RECEIVING A REPORT RIGHT NOW ON THE SITUATION IN SAN SALVADOR. THE REPORT SAYS THAT SAN SALVADOR NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS ARE STILL UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT . ARMED FORCES OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE ADMITTED THAT SOME AREAS OF SAN SALVADOR ARE CONTROLLED BY THE FMLN. THE REPORT ADDS THAT AS OF 2140 ON 12 NOVEMBER, THERE WAS STILL TENSION IN THE CITY. SOME SPORADIC SHOOTING WAS STILL HEARD, AND THE SITUATION IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CAPITAL CITY INDICATED THAT OUR COMRADES ARE MAINTAINING THEIR POSITIONS, THEY ARE CARRYING OUT MILITARY ENGINEERING TASKS, OPENING TRENCHES, AND SETTING UP BARRICADES WITH THE COOPERATION OF THE SAN SALVADOR PEOPLE. PRESS AGENCY REPORTS NOTE THAT THERE IS GREAT TENSION IN THE CAPITAL CITY, AND APPARENTLY THEY ARE EXPECTING HERE IS A NEWS AGENCY REPORT WHICH SAYS THAT EARLY THIS MORNING, LESS SHOOTING WAS HEARD BECAUSE APPARENTLY EACH SIDE HAD CONSOLIDATED THEIR POSITION. THAT IS WHAT SOME PRESS AGENCIES ARE REPORTING. WE HAVE ALSO OBSERVED THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ADMITTED THAT SOME AREAS IN THE CAPITAL CITY ARE CONTROLLED BY THE FMLN. THERE ARE MANY VEHICLES SCATTERED ALL OVER THE STREETS OF SAN SALVADOR. THAT IS THE REPORT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM SAN SALVADOR, WHERE OUR FIGHTERS IN ZACAMIL AND OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS IN THE CAPITAL CITY ARE NOW RECEIVING THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FORTIFYING THEMSELVES IN NEIGHBORHOODS. WE CALL ON THE SAN SALVADORAN YOUTHS TO GO OUT TONIGHT TO COOPERATE WITH THE FMLN FIGHTERS. MAKE THE ASSASSINS OF MSGR ROMERO PAY DEARLY FOR EVERY STEP THEY TAKE AGAINST THE PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN SAN SALVADOR CITY. IT HAS BEEN 24, 25, NEARLY 26 HOURS SINCE THE FMLN FIGHTERS ESTABLISHED THEIR POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR IN VIEW OF THE REGIME'S INCOMPETENCE. THE REGIME HAS CLEARLY SAID THAT IT IS INCAPABLE OF CONTROLLING THE SITUATION, AS IT HAS HAD TO DECREE A STATE OF SIEGE THAT BEGAN ON THE EVENING OF 12 NOVEMBER IN SAN SALVADOR. ANOTHER EVIDENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S WEAKNESS IS THE GAG PLACED ON THE MEDIA. THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT ALLOWED THE MEDIA TO BROADCAST ITS NEWSCASTS. WHY DOESN'T THE GOVERNMENT WANT THE PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO NEWSCASTS IN EL SALVADOR? WHAT IS THE CRISTIANI REGIME HIDING? THIS IS A QUESTION THAT THE PEOPLE ARE ASKING; THEY WANT TO KNOW THE ANSWER. THE GOVERNMENT IS AFRAID, IT DOES NOT WANT TO INFORM THE PEOPLE ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENTS OR THE SCOPE OF THE ACTIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL TERRITORY. COMRADE FIGHTERS: WE HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU; THIS IS IN THE BAG. YOUR COURAGE AND DETERMINATION TO WIN HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT THE FMLN PLAN AS OUR COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE GENERAL COMMAND HAS SAID. COMRADES: KEEP IT UP, KEEP AN OPEN EYE, KEEP UP THE HIGH MORALE AS YOU HAVE DONE UP TO NOW, SEEK CONTACT WITH THE PEOPLE, RECEIVE THEIR COOPERATION IN THE FORTIFICATIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE THROUGHOUT SAN SALVADOR. LET'S GO TO THE TOP AND THAT'S IT.
TST2-MUC4-0019	SAN SALVADOR, 26 JUN 89 -- PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI SAID TODAY THAT DESPITE THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST SALVADORANS, HIS GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE REBELS. HE SAID THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION IS CONTINUING ITS EFFORTS TO FORM A COMMISSION FOR A DIALOGUE WITH THE REBELS AND THAT HE IS NOW AWAITING WORD FROM TWO PEOPLE WHOM HE HAS CHOSEN TO SERVE ON THE COMMISSION. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL NOT BE REPRESENTED ON THE COMMISSION BECAUSE THE COMMISSION IS COMPLETELY POLITICAL IN NATURE. PRESIDENT CRISTIANI CONDEMNED THE MURDER OF NATIONAL FIRE DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR COLONEL ROBERTO ARMANDO RIVERA ESCOBAR, WHO WAS KILLED IN A MACHINEGUN ATTACK THIS MORNING. PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ATTRIBUTED RIVERA'S MURDER TO THE FMLN: IT IS CLEAR THAT THE FMLN DOES NOT WANT PEACE BUT INSTEAD WANTS TO CONTINUE THE VIOLENCE. THE FMLN COMMITTED THIS CRIME. I BELIEVE THAT A TREACHEROUS CRIME SUCH AS THIS ONE CANNOT BE CALLED ANYTHING BUT A COWARDLY ACT. WE WILL, OF COURSE, INVESTIGATE THE CRIME. I REPEAT, HOWEVER, THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE WE HAVE GATHERED ON THE FMLN'S PLANS INDICATE THAT IT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ACTION. WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO PREPARE THE COMMISSION THAT IS TO HOLD TALKS ? THE TERRORISTS WILL NOT OF COURSE BE SUCCESSFUL WITH ACTIONS OF THIS KIND AND WILL NOT PROVOKE US INTO VIOLENT ACTION. THEY SHOULD UNDERSTAND BY NOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS SEARCHING FOR PEACE AND WANTS TO ACHIEVE PEACE WITHIN EL SALVADOR'S LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND BY APPLYING THE LAW. THE FMLN REBELS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR TERRORIST ACTIONS WILL NOT LEAD US TO TAKE RASH ACTIONS; IT IS USELESS FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO ACT IN THIS WAY. WE ARE CONTINUING OUR WORK ON SETTING UP THE COMMISSION. TODAY WE WILL SPEAK WITH TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE STILL NOT TOLD US IF THEY WILL ACCEPT MY INVITATION TO BE COMMISSION MEMBERS. THE NAMES OF THE COMMISSION MEMBERS WILL BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC ONCE THE COMMISSION IS FULLY FORMED. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH'S ROLE IN THIS COMMISSION? THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL NOT BE REPRESENTED IN THIS COMMISSION BECAUSE IT IS A POLITICAL COMMISSION AND NOT ONE IN WHICH THE CHURCH CAN EFFECTIVELY PARTICIPATE. THE CHURCH HAS ALWAYS WORKED FOR PEACE AND HAS MADE ALL POSSIBLE EFFORTS TO FIND PEACE FOR THE COUNTRY THE CHURCH WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD THIS GOAL. HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT THE CHURCH HAS A DIFFERENT ROLE TO PLAY IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE, AND THAT ROLE IS NOT SERVING ON THE POLITICAL COMMISSION. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE YOU HAVE ENCOUNTERED IN THE MONTH THAT YOU HAVE SERVED AS PRESIDENT? I BELIEVE THAT THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE HAS BEEN OUR INABILITY TO LAUNCH OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAM, WHICH IS DUE TO THE STATE OF AFFAIRS EXISTING IN THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION WHEN WE TOOK OVER. WE HAVE REPEATEDLY OBSERVED THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS IN THE MAJORITY OF GOVERNMENT . THROUGHOUT GOVERNMENT OFFICES, DISORDER WAS RAMPANT, AND, IN MANY CASES, WE HAVE OBSERVED THAT GOVERNMENT OFFICES WERE MANAGED IRRESPONSIBLY. MOREOVER, THE NATION'S PUBLIC FINANCES HAVE GREATLY DETERIORATED. WE HAVE INHERITED A COUNTRY IN VERY BAD FINANCIAL SHAPE, AND, I BELIEVE, THIS HAS DELAYED THE LAUNCHING OF OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAM. CRISTIANI, REFERRING TO COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS' OFFER TO HOLD A DIALOGUE WITH THE REBELS IN COSTA RICAN TERRITORY, SAID THAT THE OFFER WAS A GREAT CONTRIBUTION TOWARD CONVINCING THE FMLN TO STOP MURDERING DEFENSELESS CITIZENS.
TST2-MUC4-0020	MANAGUA , 27 NOV 89 -- TODAY RESCUE TEAMS, ARMY TROOPS, AND POLICE HAD THE SORRY TASK OF RECOVERING 107 DISFIGURED BODIES OF THE VICTIMS OF AVIANCA'S BOEING 727 THAT EXPLODED IN MIDAIR IN A SPARSELY POPULATED REGION NEAR BOGOTA. ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SPOKESMEN, THE TASK IS MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE BODIES WERE SCATTERED OVER A RADIUS OF 8 KM. THE PLANE DEPARTED BOGOTA TOWARD CALI, AT 1213 GMT, BUT TWO POWERFUL EXPLOSION BROUGHT IT DOWN AFTER ONLY 5 MINUTES IN THE AIR. BOMB-SQUAD EXPERTS, IN COORDINATION WITH THREE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATORS, HAVE STARTED TO EXAMINE THE SITE TO INVESTIGATE THE ACCIDENT AND DETERMINE WHETHER THE TRAGEDY WAS CAUSED BY A MECHANICAL FAILURE, OR IF IT WAS A TERRORIST ACTION. THE BOGOTA CARACOL NETWORK RECEIVED AN ANONYMOUS CALL FROM THE EXTRADITABLES -- COLOMBIAN DRUG KINGPINS WANTED BY SEVERAL U.S. FEDERAL COURTS -- WHO SAID THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTION. ANOTHER NETWORK REPORTS THAT THE MAN WHO CALLED THE CARACOL NETWORK NEWS OFFICE SAID HE BELONGED TO THE EXTRADITABLES AND THAT THE ACTION WAS CARRIED OUT BECAUSE THERE WERE FIVE INFORMERS ON THE PLANE. THE POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT THEY ARE INVESTIGATING THE EXPLOSIONS THAT CAUSED THE PLANE TO CRASH SHORTLY AFTER IT LEFT THE BOGOTA EL DORADO AIRPORT TO GO TO CALI.
TST2-MUC4-0021	SAN SALVADOR, 8 MAR 90 -- HEAVY FIGHTING BROKE OUT IN THE NORTHERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR TONIGHT AT ABOUT 2115 , AND AS OF NOW IT IS STILL GOING ON. SAN SALVADOR IS BEING SHAKEN BY STRONG DETONATIONS OF HEAVY WEAPONS AND INTENSE RIFLE AND MACHINEGUN FIRE, WHILE HELICOPTERS ARE FLYING OVER THE AREA WHERE THE FIGHTING IS TAKING PLACE. THE FIGHTING SEEMS TO BE CENTERED IN THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS OF AYUTUXTEPEQUE, COLONIA ESCANDIA, SAN RAMON, AND CUSCATANCINGO, WHERE THE REBELS REPORTEDLY BLEW UP SEVERAL ELECTRICITY POLES WITH DYNAMITE, CAUSING POWER OUTAGES IN VARIOUS SECTORS OF THE CAPITAL CITY. A MILITARY SOURCE SAID THAT TROOPS FROM THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE HAVE BEEN DISPATCHED TO THE AREAS WHERE THE CLASHES ARE TAKING PLACE.
TST2-MUC4-0022	BOGOTA, 19 MAY 90 -- OUT OF THE TEN CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR THE COLOMBIAN PRESIDENCY, THE FOUR WHO HAVE THE BEST CHANCES OF WINNING HAVE INSERTED IN THEIR GOVERNMENT PLATFORMS SOLUTIONS TO THE CRISIS OF VIOLENCE THAT HAS TAKEN HOLD OF THE COUNTRY, CAUSED MAINLY BY THE NARCOTRAFFICKING MAFIAS AND THE GUERRILLA GROUPS. FOR LIBERAL CESAR GAVIRIA TRUJILLO, "NONVIOLENT SOLUTIONS" MUST BE FOUND THROUGH A CONDITIONED DIALOGUE WITH THE GUERRILLAS AND BY STRENGTHENING JUSTICE TO CONFRONT THE NARCOTRAFFICKERS "BECAUSE EXTRADITION CANNOT BE THE ONLY PATH TO FIGHT THIS CRIME." GAVIRIA, 43, WHO ACCORDING TO THE POLLS IS THE FAVORITE TO SUCCEED VIRGILIO BARCO AS PRESIDENT AFTER THE 27 MAY ELECTIONS, HAS MADE THE PROBLEMS OF THE GUERRILLAS AND DRUG MAFIAS THE TWO MAIN ISSUES IN HIS GOVERNMENT PLATFORM. REGARDING THE ARMED REBELS, HE INSISTS THAT NONVIOLENT SOLUTIONS MUST BE FOUND AND PROMISES TO "TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION" THE MERITS OF WHAT HAS BEEN TESTED UP TO NOW. "THE DIALOGUE WITH THE ARMED REBELS IS A CONCESSION THAT HAS BEEN MADE TO THEM, AND FOR THIS REASON SOCIETY HAS EVERY RIGHT TO ESTABLISH CONDITIONS," GAVIRIA STATED. "THUS," HE ADDED, "THE DIALOGUE WILL PREVENT THE GUERRILLAS FROM HAVING A POLITICAL PROTAGONIST ROLE AND WILL AVERT THE JUSTIFICATION OF VIOLENCE." SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE RODRIGO LLOREDA CAICEDO, 47, INSISTS THAT "THE SURRENDER OF THE MAFIA LORDS MUST BE ACHIEVED" AND THAT THIS "SHOULD INCLUDE PENALTIES FOR THE CRIMES COMMITTED, ECONOMIC COMPENSATION, AND THE CERTAINTY THAT COLOMBIA WILL NOT CONTINUE TO LEND ITSELF TO PRODUCE AND EXPORT DRUGS." LLOREDA CAICEDO IS OPPOSED TO THE EXTRADITION OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO THE UNITED STATES, AND HE OFFERS TO "STRENGTHEN JUSTICE" AND TO CHANGE PROCEDURES SO AS TO SURROUND JUDGES WITH GUARANTEES, ALL WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM THROUGH A PLEBISCITE TO CONVOKE A NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY. FOR THE ARMED REBELS, HE OFFERS "A 12-MONTH TERM FOR THEM TO REJOIN CIVILIAN LIFE" AND THE DRAFTING OF "MECHANISMS" FOR THEIR DISBANDING, SUCH AS THE "NATIONAL CIRCUMSCRIPTION" THAT WILL FACILITATE THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC AND POLITICAL LIFE. LLOREDA CAICEDO, FOREIGN MINISTER DURING BELISARIO BETANCUR'S ADMINISTRATION AND ONE OF THE PROPONENTS OF THE CONTADORA GROUP TO ATTAIN PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, SAID THAT AN EFFORT MUST BE MADE TO "RECOVER THE MONOPOLY OF THE PUBLIC FORCE AND CONSOLIDATE ITS SOVEREIGN PRESENCE." ALVARO GOMEZ HURTADO, 71, A "DISSIDENT" CONSERVATIVE, MAINTAINS THAT WITHOUT THE STRENGTHENING OF MORALS AND THE LAW -- "THE ROOT OF OUR ILLS" -- COEXISTENCE AND PROGRESS WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE. HE PLEDGES TO RESCUE THOSE TWO VALUES. GOMEZ HURTADO PRESENTED TO COLOMBIAN VOTERS A FIVE-POINT "AGREEMENT ON BASIC ISSUES," INCLUDING LAW AND MORALS, JUSTICE, ECONOMIC PLANNING, AND ECOLOGY, AS HIS GOVERNMENT PLATFORM IF HE IS ELECTED PRESIDENT ON 27 MAY. ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, THE M-19 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, WHO REPLACED THE ASSASSINATED CARLOS PIZARRO, BELIEVES THAT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC EQUILIBRIUM ARE "BASIC" TO REACHING PEACE. NAVARRO WOLFF, 41, HAS REITERATED THAT HE DOES NOT AGREE WITH THE EXTRADITION OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS, AND HE ALSO CONDEMNED THE CHAIN OF ATTACKS PERPETRATED BY DRUG TERRORISTS IN THE COUNTRY OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS. REGARDING THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, HOWEVER, HE SAID THAT THEY REQUIRE "MORE SERIOUS TREATMENT." THEREFORE, IT IS BETTER TO HAVE "A POOR DIALOGUE RATHER THAN A GOOD WAR," AND IF THAT DIALOGUE PRODUCES GOOD RESULTS "WE MUST HOLD ON TO IT," HE SAID. THE FOUR CANDIDATES AGREE ON REFORMING THE CONGRESS OF THE REPUBLIC AND THE CONSTITUTION BY CONVOKING A NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY. THEY ALSO SHARE OPINIONS ON THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC OPENING TOWARD INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, ACCESS TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT, AND PROMOTION OF AN "AGRO-INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION" WHICH WILL GUARANTEE A REDUCTION OR STABILIZATION OF THE RATE OF INFLATION.
TST2-MUC4-0023	SAN SALVADOR, 21 JAN 90 -- MSGR ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS, ARCHBISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, TODAY ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAS AGAIN RECEIVED DEATH THREATS THROUGH HIS SECRETARIES AND THE ARCHBISHOPRIC'S COOKS, "BUT I FEEL AT PEACE AND THAT I AM IN GOD'S HANDS," THE PASTOR SAID. RIVERA Y DAMAS ADMITTED, NEVERTHELESS, THAT GENERALIZED PERSECUTION OF THE CHURCH HAS DIMINISHED, ALTHOUGH IT HAS NOT DISAPPEARED, AND ADDED THAT OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS MANY PRIESTS HAVE BEEN KILLED, INCLUDING AN ARCHBISHOP, "BUT THE BLOOD OF MARTYRS IS THE SEED OF CHRISTIANS," HE SAID. RIVERA Y DAMAS POINTED OUT THAT HE HAS RECEIVED MANY COMPLAINTS CONCERNING THE CHURCH'S POSITION ON THE JESUITS' MURDER, BUT TODAY "IT IS KNOWN THAT THE ARCHBISHOPRIC WAS RIGHT TO POINT OUT WHERE IT BELIEVED THE MURDERERS WERE. THIS POSITION WAS CONFIRMED BY PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, WHO, BY FULFILLING HIS PROMISE TO GET TO THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE CASE THROUGH INVESTIGATIONS, HAS BECOME WORTHY OF WORLDWIDE RECOGNITION." IN ANOTHER PART OF HIS HOMILY RIVERA Y DAMAS SAID TODAY THAT "TO BE BISHOP OF A PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED THE SCOURGE OF A FRATRICIDAL WAR FOR THE PAST 10 YEARS IMPLIES HAVING VERY DEEPLY ROOTED MERCY FOR HUMAN PAIN, WHICH MUST TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER ANY POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, OR IDEOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS, AND IS AN IRREVOCABLE PLEDGE." THE ARCHBISHOP SAID THAT AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT ECLESSIASTICAL EVENTS OF THE WEEK IN SAN SALVADOR WERE THE SALVADORAN EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE, WHICH CONCLUDED WITH A CALL FOR PEACE, AND THE CONSIGNMENT TO COURTS OF JUSTICE OF THE SOLDIERS ACCUSED OF MURDERING THE JESUIT PRIESTS. THERE WAS SPECIAL INTEREST IN THE MEETING, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT WAS KNOWN THAT A LETTER HAD BEEN SENT TO THE BISHOPS BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN, REQUESTING THE CHURCH'S MEDIATION AND ITS EFFORTS TO RESUME A DIALOGUE. "I BELIEVE," MSGR RIVERA Y DAMAS SAID, "THAT THE MEETINGS OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE FMLN WITH THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL ARE IMPORTANT." TO CONCLUDE, RIVERA Y DAMAS REITERATED THAT "WE MUST END THIS WAR THROUGH DIALOGUE AND RATIONAL MEANS BEFORE THE WAR FINISHES US ALL."
TST2-MUC4-0024	CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- COMMANDER, WHAT CAN THE POPULAR MOVEMENT, THE LABOR UNIONS, AND THE HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS DO IN THE FACE OF A GOVERNMENT AND A MILITARY LEADERSHIP THAT CARRY OUT THIS TYPE OF ATTACK, THIS TYPE OF MASSACRE, IN A LEGAL FRAMEWORK THAT OFFERS NO GUARANTEE TO THE POPULAR MOVEMENT? WHAT CAN THE POPULAR MOVEMENT DO? I BELIEVE THAT THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT IS CLOSING ALL THE ROADS TO A PEACEFUL SOLUTION OF THIS CONFLICT. THROUGH REPRESSION IT IS CLOSING OFF THE POSSIBILITY OF LABOR UNIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS RESOLVING THEIR PROBLEMS PEACEFULLY. THE GOVERNMENT IS CLOSING OFF THE POSSIBILITY OF NEGOTIATIONS. THE ARMY AND THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT ARE OPPOSED TO TRUE NEGOTIATIONS. THE PEOPLE HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE. IN EL SALVADOR THERE IS A LATENT PATH, THE PATH OF ARMED ACTIONS. AT THIS MOMENT, AS THIS GOVERNMENT INCREASES REPRESSION, ARMED ACTIONS BECOME INCREASINGLY LEGITIMATE, ARMED ACTIONS TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO THE CONFLICT, ARMED ACTIONS TO STOP THE REPRESSION BY THE REGIME. THE WORKERS AND THEIR ASSOCIATIONS AND LABOR UNIONS ARE ENTITLED TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AND THEIR LABOR BENEFITS. DEFENSE IS LEGITIMATE. IT IS LEGITIMATE FOR THE WORKERS TO DECIDE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES THE ARMED WAY, THROUGH VIOLENCE. IT IS THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT, PONCE, AND THE HIGH COMMAND WHO ARE LEAVING THE WORKERS NO ALTERNATIVE. TO CONCLUDE, COMMANDER: IN RECENT HOURS THERE HAVE BEEN ATTACKS IN THE CAPITAL, INCLUDING BOMB ATTACKS ON THE RESIDENCES OF DEMOCRATIC LEADERS SUCH AS RUBEN ZAMORA AND ARONETE DIAZ, AN ATTACK ON THE RESIDENCE OF COLONEL CARRANZA, AND AN ATTACK ON A RELATIVE OF COLONEL LOPEZ HUILA, AMONG OTHERS. THE ARMED FORCES AND THE GOVERNMENT HAVE PUBLICLY SAID THAT THE FMLN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE ATTACKS. OUR ARMED ACTIONS ARE HIGHLY JUST AND HAVE POLITICAL MOTIVATIONS. OUR OBJECTIVES ARE STRICTLY MILITARY. ALL OUR GUERRILLA UNITS FUNCTION ACCORDING TO THIS PRINCIPLE, BE IT IN THE RURAL AREAS OR IN THE CITIES WHERE OUR URBAN COMMANDOS OPERATE. THE ATTACK ON THE ARMED FORCES STAFF INSTALLATIONS AND OTHER OPERATIONS AGAINST MILITARY TARGETS ARE OUR RESPONSIBILITY. THE FMLN'S POLICY IS NOT TO ATTACK RELATIVES OF MILITARY MEN OR POLITICIANS. THE HIGH COMMAND HAS BEEN TRYING TO CONFUSE THE PEOPLE HERE AND ABROAD. WHAT IS ITS OBJECTIVE? TO COVER UP ITS REPRESSIVE POLICY. IT IS ESCALATING ITS ACTIONS. IT HAS GONE FROM THE SELECTIVE CAPTURE AND MURDER OF LEADERS TO MASS ARRESTS, AND FROM MASS ARRESTS IT HAS MOVED INTO GENOCIDE AND INDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS. IT IS CLEAR THAT ITS OBJECTIVE IS THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS. THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT IN SAN JOSE. IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE HIGH COMMAND IS TRYING TO CREATE CONFUSION, BUT THE PEOPLE ABROAD AND WE KNOW THAT OUR ACTIONS ARE AIMED AT MILITARY OBJECTIVES.
TST2-MUC4-0025	SAN JOSE , 18 NOV 89 -- THE GUATEMALAN GUERRILLA MOVEMENT TODAY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL MAKE THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO AND THE GUATEMALAN ARMY "PAY DEARLY" FOR HAVING "INTERVENED" IN THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT. A COMMUNIQUE BY THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY , RELEASED IN COSTA RICA, STRESSED THAT 126 ELITE TROOPS OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMY, KNOWN AS KAIBILES, ARE COLLABORATING WITH SALVADORAN SOLDIERS TO PUT AN END TO THE OFFENSIVE BY GUERRILLAS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT . THE URNG CHARGE, ALSO PRESENTED BY THE FMLN, HAS BEEN CATEGORICALLY AND REPEATEDLY DENIED BY GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT SPOKESWOMAN CLAUDIA ARENAS. THE REBEL COMMUNIQUE STATED: "WE VIGOROUSLY CONDEMN THE INTERVENTION OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMY AGAINST THE GLORIOUS SALVADORAN PEOPLE. WE WILL MAKE THE GUATEMALAN ARMY AND GOVERNMENT PAY DEARLY FOR THIS AGGRESSION." THE NOTE WAS RELEASED SHORTLY AFTER SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED THE VICTORY OF HIS COUNTRY'S ARMY OVER THE FMLN, FOLLOWING FIERCE FIGHTING THAT LEFT APPROXIMATELY 1,000 DEAD AND MORE THAN 1,500 WOUNDED IN THE PAST 7 DAYS. IN ADDITION, THE GUATEMALAN GUERRILLAS EXPRESSED SOLIDARITY "WITH THE COMMUNITY OF JESUIT PRIESTS" AND THEIR SORROW BECAUSE OF THE KILLING OF SIX OF THEIR MEMBERS, INCLUDING CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY RECTOR IGNACIO ELLACURIA AND TWO WOMEN, CARRIED OUT BY UNIFORMED MEN IN SAN SALVADOR ON 16 NOVEMBER. THE URNG DECLARATION IS SIGNED BY COMMANDERS ROLANDO MORAN, GASPAR ILOM, AND PABLO MONSANTO.
TST2-MUC4-0026	BOGOTA, 26 APR 90 -- THE EXTRADITABLES, THE ARMED BRANCH OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, DENIED TODAY IN A TELEPHONE CALL TO A RADIO STATION BY AN ALLEGED MEMBER, ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEATH OF CARLOS PIZARRO, POLITICAL LEADER AND FORMER GUERRILLA COMMANDER. THE CALLER IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS JOHN JAIRO ARIAS TASCON. HE CALLED THE CARACOL NETWORK IN MEDELLIN TO DENOUNCE THAT THE CHARGES AGAINST THE MEDELLIN CARTEL ARE PART OF A PLAN TO BLAME THEM FOR ALL VIOLENT ACTIONS IN THE COUNTRY. THE AUTHORS OF THE ASSASSINATION ARE SECTORS WHO SEEK TO DESTABILIZE THE COUNTRY, ARIAS TASCON ADDED. PIZARRO, FORMER LEADER OF THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT , THE GUERRILLA GROUP THAT LAID DOWN ITS WEAPONS ON 9 MARCH, WAS KILLED BY THE IMPACT OF THREE BULLETS FIRED AT HIM ABOARD A COLOMBIAN AVIANCA FLIGHT THAT WAS EN ROUTE TO THE CITY OF BARRANQUILLA ALONG THE COUNTRY'S ATLANTIC COAST. AFTER THE CRIME, AT 1100 , AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS SAPATOCA CALLED CARACOL TO REPORT THAT THE KILLING HAD BEEN ORDERED BY FIDEL CASTANO AND HENRY PEREZ, HEADS OF THE EXTREME RIGHTIST PARAMILITARY MILITIAS. SAPATOCA ADDED THAT CASTANO AND PEREZ PERPETRATED THE CRIME FOLLOWING ORDERS FROM THE EXTRADITABLES. CASTANO WAS CONNECTED TO THE DEATH OF BERNARDO JARAMILLO, ALSO A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, FOR THE LEFTIST PATRIOTIC UNION , ON 22 MARCH, ALTHOUGH AT THAT TIME IT WAS REPORTED THAT CASTANO HEADED A PARAMILITARY ORGANIZATION THAT DID NOT IMPLICATE THE EXTRADITABLES. ON THAT OCCASION PABLO ESCOBAR, LEADER OF THE EXTRADITABLES AND THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, DENIED THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAD KILLED JARAMILLO. A CONFIDENTIAL REPORT DRAFTED RECENTLY BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY , SAID THAT SOME ARMY AND POLICE MEMBERS COOPERATE WITH CASTANO'S CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION. NAVARRO WOLFF, NUMBER TWO LEADER OF M-19, TOLD NEWSMEN TODAY AFTER PIZARRO WAS KILLED THAT HIS BURIAL MUST BE ATTENDED BY ALL THE COUNTRY, BECAUSE WE MUST REPUDIATE CRIME SUCH AS THIS. NAVARRO WOLFF SAID THAT PIZARRO'S DEATH SHOWS THAT THE COUNTRY IS IN TURMOIL AND THAT IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO REBUILD THE COUNTRY. THERE IS NO SPACE EXCEPT FOR PAIN AND FOR IRE, HE ADDED. THE BURIAL OF CARLOS MUST BE PEACEFUL, AS WAS M-19'S EXAMPLE OF PEACE GIVEN TO THE COUNTRY, HE ADDED. IT IS HARD TO EXPLAIN HOW THINGS SUCH AS THIS OCCUR WHEN THE M-19 AND CARLOS PIZARRO WERE SETTING AN EXAMPLE OF PRUDENCE, TOLERANCE, AND UNDERSTANDING, NAVARRO SAID. PIZARRO, A FORMER GUERRILLA COMMANDER WHO LED HIS ARMED GROUP TOWARD DEMOBILIZATION AFTER 17 MONTHS OF POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF VIRGILIO BARCO, TOLD NEWSMEN BEFORE BOARDING THE AIRCRAFT: WE ARE DOING WELL. THIS WAS A REFERENCE TO THE M-19 ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN. PIZARRO STATED IN HIS LAST PUBLIC STATEMENT: I AM CERTAIN THAT WE WILL KNOW HOW TO WAGE OPPOSITION. WE WILL ENGAGE IN A VERY PRETTY DEMOCRATIC PLAY WITH REGARD TO THE NEXT GOVERNMENT. WE WILL PARTICIPATE IN BUILDING NEW COLOMBIAN DEMOCRACY. THE M-19 PARTICIPATED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE 11 MARCH ELECTIONS, BECOMING THE THIRD POLITICAL FORCE IN BOGOTA. NOTHING HAS BEEN SAID YET CONCERNING THE BURIAL OF PIZARRO, WHO WAS BORN 39 YEARS AGO IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS AND WHO LEAVES THREE ORPHAN DAUGHTERS, AGED 12, 9, AND 4.
TST2-MUC4-0027	SAN SALVADOR, 6 DEC 89 -- COLONEL, WHAT SPECIFIC MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN AGAINST THE MISSILES? I BELIEVE THAT SPECIFIC MEASURES WE HAVE ADOPTED HAVE GIVEN US GOOD RESULTS. THEY HAVE LAUNCHED FOUR SA-7'S IN THE ZACATECOLUCA AREA; HOWEVER, OUR PILOTS HAVE SKILLFULLY AVOIDED THE ROCKETS OR MISSILES, WHICH DID NOT HIT THEIR AIRCRAFT. WE ARE ADOPTING MEASURES THAT ARE GIVING RESULTS. WE MUST ALSO CLARIFY THAT WE FEEL THAT SINCE THE LIGHT AIRCRAFT TRANSPORTING THESE MISSILES DID NOT HAVE A NORMAL LANDING AND THE MISSILES WERE NOT IN THEIR ORIGINAL PACKAGE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY SUFFERED SOME FUNCTIONAL DAMAGE WHEN THE PLANE CRASHED SOUTH OF ZACATECOLUCA. THANK GOD, DO YOU THINK THAT THE SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS CAN OPEN NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR RESUMING TALKS WITH THE FMLN? DO YOU THINK THAT THIS SUMMIT COULD BRING ABOUT NEW STEPS TOWARD A DIALOGUE? YES, I THINK THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR HAS OPENED THIS POSSIBILITY AND IS WILLING TO TALK ON A PERMANENT BASIS. I THINK THAT AT THIS TIME IT WOULD BE A POSITIVE STEP IN THE POLITICAL FIELD. HOWEVER, IN THE MILITARY FIELD, WHERE THE FMLN HAS ATTACKED US IN AN IRRATIONAL AND VIOLENT WAY IN THE MAIN CITIES, THE ARMED FORCES IS REPLYING, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO REPLY. WE WILL COMPLETELY DEFEAT THE FMLN. BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM OUR UNITS, WE HAVE INFLICTED 1,902 DEAD, 1,209 WOUNDED, AND 44 TERRORISTS HAVE DESERTED AND TURNED THEMSELVES IN TO THE AUTHORITIES. WE HAVE CONFISCATED A LARGE NUMBER OF WEAPONS. I WILL GIVE YOU THE QUANTITIES: 25 ANTIAIRCRAFT MISSILES -- ONE RED EYE AND 24 SA-7'S -- 915 RIFLES, 12 CARBINES, 11 SHOTGUNS, 156 GRENADE AND ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 49 MORTARS, 45 MACHINEGUNS, 41 SUBMACHINEGUNS, 67 REVOLVERS AND PISTOLS, 23 RADIOS, AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF EXPLOSIVES. I MUST STRESS THAT THE FMLN HAS GATHERED ALL THESE WEAPONS WITH SUPPPORT FROM ABROAD. IT IS A LARGE ARSENAL. I MUST ALSO NOTE THAT MANY OF THE WEAPONS WE FOUND HAD BEEN ABANDONED, WHICH MEANS THAT THE FMLN HAS HAD MANY DESERTIONS. WE HAVE ALSO FOUND WEAPONS IN HOUSES, THANKS TO THE COLLABORATION OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT THE FMLN HAS KIDNAPPED A LARGE NUMBER OF YOUTHS HERE IN THE SAN SALVADOR AREA AND MAINLY IN USULUTAN, AS WELL AS IN CHALATENANGO. THIS MEANS THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO FILL IN THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES THEY HAVE SUFFERED WITH YOUTHS. THIS ALSO MEANS THAT THEIR EFFICIENCY WILL BE VERY LOW. I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS A LEAFLET ISSUED BY THE AIR FORCE, WHICH WAS DROPPED FROM AIRPLANES AND ALSO DISTRIBUTED ON THE STREETS. THE LEAFLET URGES SALVADORAN PATRIOTS TO DEFEND THEIR HOMELAND, THEIR PROPERTIES, AND LIVES. IT ALSO SAYS THAT IF NECESSARY, TERRORISTS MUST BE KILLED, AS WELL AS THEIR INTERNATIONALIST ALLIES. WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF THIS LEAFLET? IS IT NOT AN INVITATION TO KILL FOREIGNERS IN THIS COUNTRY? I DO NOT THINK SO, BECAUSE THE LEAFLETS MENTION INTERNATIONALISTS, WHO ARE FIGHTING ALONG WITH THE FMLN.
TST2-MUC4-0028	CLANDESTINE, 22 JUL 89 -- IN CONNECTION WITH THE BOMB ATTACK ON THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY AT DAYBREAK ON 22 JULY, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT STATES THE FOLLOWING: 1. THIS ACT IS PART OF THE POLICY OF TERROR THAT THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE GOVERNMENT HAS IMPLEMENTED IN AN ATTEMPT TO DISCOURAGE ALL TYPES OF OPPOSITION TO THE ANTIPOPULAR AND ANTIDEMOCRATIC MEASURES THE GOVERNMENT IS TAKING. WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK, WE HAVE: THE SIEGE ON THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, THREATS AGAINST TEACHERS AND POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCREASING REPRESSION AGAINST THE PEOPLES' MOVEMENT. 2. THE ATTACK IS CLEARLY INTENDED TO CAUSE UNREST AMONG THE PARTICIPANTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SOLIDARITY CONFERENCE OF SISTER TRADE UNIONS THAT BEGAN TODAY AT THE UCA. 3. WE, THEREFORE, HOLD ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FOCES HIGH COMMAND RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS NEW TERRORIST ATTACK. 4. WE STRONGLY CONDEMN THE ATTACK ON THE UCA AND CALL UPON ALL INTERESTED PARTIES TO JOIN FORCES TO CONFRONT ARENA'S TERRORIST POLICIES.
TST2-MUC4-0029	SAN SALVADOR, 30 NOV 89 -- THROUGH THESE MEANS, THE ARMED FORCES HEREBY NOTIFIES THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, SPECIFICALLY THOSE LIVING IN THE ESCALON RESIDENTIAL AREA OF SAN SALVADOR, THAT THEY SHOULD NOT HEED RUMORS CIRCULATING TO THE EFFECT THAT THE ESCALON RESIDENTIAL AREA WILL BE BOMBED. THIS IS FALSE. ANY ACTIONS AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM WILL BE ANNOUNCED IN DUE TIME. THE RESIDENTS OF ESCALON SHOULD REST ASSURED AND NOT LEAVE THEIR HOMES.
TST2-MUC4-0030	LIMA, 19 JAN 89 -- TWO SUBVERSIVES WERE KILLED AND A POLICEMAN WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED IN A SHOOT-OUT EARLY THIS MORNING NEAR THE SAN CARLOS SERVICE STATION IN CANTO GRANDE. THE SHOOT-OUT OCCURRED WHEN A POLICE PATROL INTERCEPTED FOUR SUSPECTS IN THE AREA OF THE SERVICE STATION. POLICEMAN JOSE FELIX AGUIRRE WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED BY A BULLET IN THE CHEST AND ANOTHER IN THE ARM. HE WAS TAKEN TO THE POLICE HOSPITAL. TWO OF THE WOUNDED SUBVERSIVES DIED LATER AT THE RIMAC HOSPITAL WHERE THEY WERE TAKEN BY THE MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL POLICE. THE OTHER SUBVERSIVES ESCAPED. POLICE SOURCES STATED THAT THE SUBVERSIVES WERE PLANNING TO BLOW UP THE SERVICE STATION BECAUSE A BLUEPRINT OF THE STATION WAS FOUND IN THEIR POSSESSION. IT SHOULD BE POINTED OUT THAT THE SUBVERSIVES USED FIREARMS WITH SILENCERS.
TST2-MUC4-0031	TEGUCIGALPA, 29 MAY 89 -- SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS TODAY STATED THAT CIVILIANS AND SOLDIERS WERE KILLED ON SATURDAY DURING AN ARMED CLASH BETWEEN THE HONDURAN AND SALVADORAN ARMIES. THROUGH A COMMUNIQUE, THE GUERRILLAS EMPHASIZED THE ARMED CLASH TOOK PLACE AFTER HONDURAN ARMY TROOPS ATTACKED IN THE HAMLET OF SAN ANDRES, SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT, IN NORTHERN EL SALVADOR. MEMBERS OF THE COUNTERINSURGENCY ARCE BATTALION, WHO WERE CONDUCTING AN OPERATION NEAR THE HONDURAN BORDER, RESPONDED, SUPPORTED BY TWO AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS. THE REPORT BY THE REBELS, BROADCAST FROM SAN SALVADOR BY TEGUCIGALPA RADIO AMERICA, ADDED THAT AN UNNAMED ARCE BATTALION OFFICER WAS KILLED IN THE CLASH. THE HONDURAN TROOPS THEN RETREATED TO LOS LLANITOS, INTIBUCA DEPARTMENT, IN HONDURAS, WHERE FOUR SALVADORAN HELICOPTERS LANDED, ACCORDING TO THE FMLN. THE REPORT ADDED THAT AS A HONDURAN HELICOPTER EVACUATED THE WOUNDED, IT WAS ATTACKED AND PURSUED 7 KM INSIDE HONDURAN TERRITORY BY A SALVADORAN AIRCRAFT FIRING ROCKETS AND MACHINEGUNS. THE HONDURAN SOLDIERS WERE SURROUNDED IN LOS LLANITOS AND TAKEN PRISONER. THE FMLN STATED THAT SEVERAL HOMES WERE DAMAGED AND THAT ANIMALS WERE KILLED IN THE SURROUNDING HAMLETS AND VILLAGES. THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA NOTED THAT IT HAD PREVIOUSLY WARNED THAT THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE HONDURAN ARMY "DUE TO U.S. DISPOSITIONS" IN THE EL SALVADOR WAR, WOULD RESULT IN CLASHES AMONG THE ARMIES OF CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES. THE FMLN REPORT STATES THAT "IT IS NO SECRET THAT THE OLIGARCHS WHO REACH POWER THROUGH THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE GOVERNMENT ARE THE SAME PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE 1969 INVASION OF HONDURAS." THE OFFICERS, WHO AT THAT TIME "WERE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR KILLINGS, PILLAGING, AND OUTRAGES AGAINST THE HONDURAN PEOPLE, ARE TODAY MEMBERS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES LEADERSHIP," THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS. ACCORDING TO THE FMLN, SATURDAY'S CLASH "WILL SET THE TONE THAT DEFINES THE BORDER CONFLICT FOR A GOVERNMENT OF OLIGARCHS THAT HAS ALWAYS HAD AN EXPANSIONIST ATTITUDE TOWARD HONDURAS." ALSO REQUESTS THAT THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES NOT GET INVOLVED IN A WAR FOREIGN TO THEM. THE HONDURAN MILITARY HAS NEITHER DENIED NOR CONFIRMED THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS REPORTS, AND AN ARMY SPOKESMAN HAS STATED THAT INVESTIGATIONS ARE BEING CONDUCTED. THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES, HAVE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, REPORTED THAT THE GUERRILLAS HAVE "HIDEOUTS" IN SALVADORAN REFUGEE CAMPS, AND CONTINUOUSLY ENTER HONDURAN TERRITORY TO REST OR FOR RESUPPLY OF WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION.
TST2-MUC4-0032	BOGOTA, 22 MAR 90 -- DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL OSCAR BOTERO RESTREPO DISCLOSED THIS AFTERNOON THAT MEDELLIN CARTEL BOSS PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA ORDERED THE ASSASSINATION OF BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF PATRIOTIC UNION, UP. BOTERO SAID THAT INITIAL INVESTIGATIONS HAVE REVEALED THAT ESCOBAR GAVIRIA PLANNED AND ORDERED THE ATTACK ON JARAMILLO OSSA. GEN. BOTERO TOLD REPORTERS THAT THE MEDELLIN CARTEL CONTRACTED THE SERVICES OF AN ORGANIZATION OF HIRED ASSASSINS AND SENT THEM TO BOGOTA TO ASSASSINATE THE UP LEADER. HE ADDED THAT ESCOBAR GAVIRIA ORDERED THE DELIVERY OF AN INITIAL SUM OF 300,000 PESOS TO A THIRD PERSON AFTER THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED AT EL DORADO AIRPORT'S PEDESTRIAN OVERPASS IN BOGOTA. THE DEFENSE MINISTER SAID THAT MINUTES AFTER THE KILLING THE DAS INTELLIGENCE SERVICE INTERCEPTED AN ESCOBAR GAVIRIA CONVERSATION IN MEDELLIN. HE WAS ORDERING HIS ACCOMPLICES TO PAY 300,000 PESOS TO A THIRD PERSON LINKED TO THE PAID ASSASSIN WHO KILLED THE UP LEADER. BOTERO ALSO DISCLOSED THAT THE ASSASSIN IS A 16-YEAR-OLD YOUTH WHO CARRIED A FALSE IDENTIFICATION CARD UNDER THE NAME OF JAIRO ALBERTO RESTREPO POSADA. MEANWHILE, ANONYMOUS CALLS WERE RECEIVED BY VARIOUS BOGOTA MEDIA TODAY. THE CALLERS WERE ATTRIBUTING THE ATTACK ON UP LEADER JARAMILLO OSSA TO A SO-CALLED GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA COMMANDO GROUP. IN THESE CALLS, IT WAS SAID THAT THE MEDELLIN CARTEL DECIDED TO RESUME THE WAR BECAUSE FOR FIVE MONTHS IT OFFERED TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS GOVERNMENT, AND THE ONLY RESPONSE IT RECEIVED WAS TO URGE CARTEL MEMBERS TO TURN THEMSELVES IN TO JUSTICE. IN ADDITION, THREATS WERE MADE AGAINST OTHER COLOMBIAN POLITICAL FIGURES SUCH AS LIBERAL PARTY CANDIDATE CESAR GAVIRIA TRUJILLO. THE CALLERS SAID THAT THE EXTRADITABLES RELEASED KIDNAPPED PEOPLE, DELIVERED LABORATORIES, AND LARGE QUANTITIES OF DYNAMITE AS PROOF OF THEIR INTENTION TO TALK, BUT THEY NEVER RECEIVED A REPLY FROM THE GOVERNMENT. THE CALLERS SAID: WE ARE GOING TO TURN OURSELVES IN, BUT WE WILL BE DEAD WHEN WE DO SO. HOWEVER, BEFORE THIS HAPPENS, THEY SAID, THE COUNTRY WILL SEE THE BODIES OF ITS LEADERS, JUST AS IN THE CASE OF JARAMILLO OSSA.
TST2-MUC4-0033	SAN SALVADOR, 28 NOV 89 -- FRANCISCO MERINO, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND INTERIOR MINISTER, HAS STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE MURDER OF FORMER SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT FRANCISCO JOSE GUERRERO. MERINO DESCRIBED THE CULPRITS AS MURDEROUS BEASTS. THE VICE PRESIDENT WENT TO THE MEDICAL-SURGICAL HOSPITAL OF THE SALVADORAN INSTITUTE OF SOCIAL SECURITY, TO WHICH DR GUERRERO WAS TAKEN AFTER THE ATTACK. GUERRERO, WHO WAS AN ADVISER TO THE GOVERNMENTAL COMMISSION FOR SUPPORT TO THE DIALOGUE , WAS SHOT TO DEATH BY TERRORISTS AT THE INTERSECTION OF BOULEVARD DE LOS HEROES AND ALAMEDA JUAN PABLO II. WHAT THEY ARE SHOWING IS THAT THEY ARE BENT ON CARRYING OUT TOTALLY DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS TO LOWER THE CONFIDENCE OF THE POPULATION AND TO PROVOKE GENERAL PANIC. I THINK THAT ALTHOUGH AS A GOVERNMENT WE HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED A CONCILIATORY POSITION TO ATTAIN PEACE IN EL SALVADOR, WE MUST ALSO MAKE A FIRMER DECISION TO TAKE STRONGER ACTION. THE PEOPLE WHO COMMIT THESE WANTON ACTIONS ARE DERANGED PEOPLE. THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND WORDS. THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THEY MUST RESPECT A LEGAL SYSTEM, OR A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS OR ONE OF HUMANIZATION. THEY ARE SIMPLY BEASTS AND MURDERERS AND MUST BE TREATED AS SUCH. MERINO SAID THE MURDERERS MUST BE PUNISHED WITH THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE LAWS, AND THAT ONE OF THE TERRORISTS WHO WAS WOUNDED AND CAPTURED AT THE SITE OF THE CRIME IS UNDER INTERROGATION. ONE OF THE CRIMINALS WAS WOUNDED. THIS WILL OBVIOUSLY ENABLE US TO OBTAIN SOME CLUES AS TO THE IDENTITY OF THE ACTUAL KILLERS AND OF THE MASTERMINDS OF THIS NEW MURDER, WHICH HAS SHOCKED SALVADORAN SOCIETY. AS IN PREVIOUS CASES, WE ARE CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS IN THIS CASE. HOWEVER, I REPEAT THAT THE TIME HAS COME FOR US TO TAKE A FIRMER STAND, TO DO OUR UTMOST, AND TO REALIZE THAT IF NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO US THUS FAR, IT DOES NOT MEAN WE WILL NOT FALL VICTIM TO THESE MURDERERS. IT IS BETTER TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS NOW THAN TO HAVE REGRETS LATER. MERINO SAID THAT THIS CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE PROMOTED BY THE TERRORIST HORDES HAS NOT ENDED. CLEAR EVIDENCE OF THIS IS THIS BRUTAL AND COWARDLY MURDER, WHICH HAS AGAIN FILLED THE SUFFERING SALVADORAN PEOPLE WITH SORROW.
TST2-MUC4-0034	GUATEMALA CITY, 22 SEP 89 -- FIVE GUATEMALAN UNIVERSITY LEADERS THREATENED WITH DEATH HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE IN PANAMA, COSTA RICA, AND MEXICO, WHILE UN HUMAN RIGHTS OBSERVER PETER KOOIJMANS IS IN GUATEMALA CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION ON THE INCREASING VIOLENCE IN THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY. ACCORDING TO MEMBERS OF THE UNIVERSITY STUDENT ASSOCIATION OF SAN CARLOS DE GUATEMALA UNIVERSITY, THE STUDENTS LEADERS DECIDED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUOUS THREATS OF DEATH AND PERSECUTION AND DUE TO THE KIDNAPPING AND ASSASSINATION OF FIVE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. THE NAMES OF THE STUDENTS WHO FLED THE COUNTRY ARE BEING KEPT SECRET TO PROTECT THEIR RELATIVES WHO LIVE IN GUATEMALA CITY AND IN THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY, THE SOURCES MAINTAINED. THREE OF THE STUDENTS TRAVELED TO PANAMA, ONE TO MEXICO, AND ANOTHER TO COSTA RICA. THIS MONTH, THE CORPSES OF FIVE ASSASSINATED AEU LEADERS WERE FOUND IN THE CAPITAL, SOME WITH SIGNS OF TORTURE. SIX OTHER UNIVERSITY STUDENT LEADERS REMAIN KIDNAPPED. BELISARIO POLO, STUDENT AFFAIRS DIRECTOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PANAMA, TODAY TOLD EFE THAT THE THREE AEU LEADERS ARRIVED IN THE COUNTRY LAST WEEKEND AND ARE LIVING IN PRIVATE HOUSES. GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SAID THEY HAVE NO OFFICIAL REPORTS ON THE DEPARTURE OF THE HIGHEST AEU LEADERS. THE DEPARTURE OF THE FIVE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS LEADERS COINCIDES WITH THE VISIT TO GUATEMALA OF PETER KOOIJMANS, WHO YESTERDAY MET GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND ARMY OFFICERS TO GATHER INFORMATION. DURING HIS MEETING WITH GOVERNMENT MINISTER ROBERTO VALLE, KOOIJMANS REQUESTED REPORTS ON THE INVESTIGATIONS THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONDUCTED ON THE CASE OF THE KIDNAPPED STUDENTS, THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SAID. THE KIDNAPPING AND ASSASSINATION OF THE FIVE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND THE THREATS AGAINST OTHER AEU MEMBERS HAVE BEEN CONDEMNED BY LEADERS FROM UNIVERSITIES IN MEXICO, HONDURAS, PERU, COLOMBIA, COSTA RICA, EL SALVADOR, NICARAGUA, AND PANAMA. UNIVERSITY STUDENTS LEADERS FROM CANADA, ECUADOR, CHILE, AND THE FRG HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR SOLIDARITY AND DEMANDED THAT THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE THESE ASSASSINATIONAS. THE AEU REQUESTED THE HIGHER UNIVERSITY COUNCIL TO SUSPEND CLASSES FOR THE CURRENT SEMESTER IN VIEW OF THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE GUATEMALA IS SUFFERING AND IN VIEW OF THE DEATH THREATS AGAINST THE MAIN STUDENT LEADERS. AS A RESPONSE, THE CSU HAS DECIDED TO LET EACH ACADEMIC SECTION DECIDE THE STRATEGY IT WILL IMPLEMENT TO GET PROTECTION FROM THE VIOLENCE. SEVERAL OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY SCHOOLS HAVE MODIFIED THE EVENING SCHEDULE, AND MOST CLASSES HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO 2-HOURS PERIODS SO STUDENTS CAN RETURN HOME EARLY. SEVERAL LABOR UNION ORGANIZATIONS HAVE CONDEMNED THE KIDNAPPING AND ASSASSINATION ON 15 SEPTEMBER OF EDUARDO ANTONIO LOPEZ PALENCIA, A STUDENT WHOSE CORPSE SHOWED SIGNS OF TORTURE.
TST2-MUC4-0035	SAN SALVADOR, 25 JUL 89 -- THE SALVADORAN ARMY REPORTED TODAY THAT IT HAD SEIZED AN ARSENAL IN THE NORTHERN OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR. AN ARMY SOURCE SAID THAT THE DISCOVERY OF THIS ARSENAL THWARTS TERRORIST PLANS IN SAN SALVADOR. THE ARSENAL WAS DISCOVERED AT THE SUCHINANGO FARM, NEJAPA JURISDICTION, APPROXIMATELY 18 KM NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR. IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT THE MILITIAS WHO ATTACK MILITARY POSITIONS IN THE METROPOLITAN AREA GENERALLY ARE BASED AT THE SUCHINANGO FARM. THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE DISPLAYED THE ARSENAL, WHICH INCLUDED 20,543 CARTRIDGES OF VARIOUS CALIBERS, 2 NORTH KOREAN - MADE SUBMACHINEGUNS, 42 CARTRIDGE CLIPS FOR AK-47 RIFLES, AND SMALL ARMS. IN ADDITION, THE SALVADORAN ARMY CONFISCATED APPROXIMATELY 5,000 FUSES FOR EXPLOSIVES, FRAGMENTATION GRENADES, INCENDIARY BOMBS, 200 STICKS OF TNT, AND OTHER WAR EQUIPMENT. SOURCES FROM THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE REPORTED THAT THE BRIGADE CONDUCTS PERMANENT OPERATIONS IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ATTACKS ON MILITARY POSTS IN THE METROPOLITAN AREA.
TST2-MUC4-0036	CLANDESTINE, 7 FEB 89 -- IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE FREE ELECTIONS IN A COUNTRY WHERE REPRESSION PREVAILS. IN AN INDISPUTABLE EFFORT OF CLEAR FLEXIBILITY AND WILLINGNESS FOR PEACE, THE FMLN PRESENTED A PEACE PROPOSAL TO JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE'S GOVERNMENT AND THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND. THAT PROPOSAL IS AIMED AT TURNING ELECTIONS INTO A CONTRIBUTION TO PEACE. TWO WEEKS HAVE PASSED SINCE WE PRESENTED OUR PROPOSAL, AND NEITHER THE GOVERNMENT NOR THE ARMED FORCES HAVE OFFICIALLY RESPONDED TO THE FMLN INITIATIVE. THAT INITIATIVE HAS HAD THE SUPPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND OF OUR COUNTRY'S LARGEST GROUPS. NEITHER THE GOVERNMENT NOR THE HIGH COMMAND HAVE RESPONDED TO THE PEOPLE'S OUTCRY AND WORLD EXPECTATIONS, WHICH ARE AWAITING A POSITIVE RESPONSE TO OUR PROPOSAL. ON THE CONTRARY, THE GOVERNMENT, ITS ARMED FORCES, AND THE MEMBERS OF THEIR SQUADS DISGUISED IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES CONTINUE THEIR DIRTY WAR AGAINST THE PEOPLES MOVEMENT AND THEIR WIDESPREAD WAR IN THE COUNTRYSIDE. THE NATIONAL GUARD MURDERED UNIVERSITY STUDENT MARIO FLORES, WHOSE BODY WAS LEFT ON A HIGHWAY NEAR THE PORT OF ACAJUTLA. MEANWHILE, NATIONAL POLICE MEMBERS WHO WERE DRESSED IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES SEIZED UNIVERSITY STUDENTS HUGO MARTINEZ AND RAUL RAMIREZ, WHO ARE STILL MISSING. JAIME ESTEVEZ, A MEMBER OF THE BREAD, LAND, WORK, AND FREEDOM MOVEMENT WAS TAKEN TO THE USULUTAN JAIL TO BE MURDERED AND THE CRIME WAS SUPPOSED TO GO UNNOTICED. MEANWHILE, ACCORDING TO REPORTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF AGRICULTURAL AND LIVESTOCK COOPERATIVES, FENACOA, ON 31 JANUARY, OROMONTIQUE BATTALION TROOPS OF THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE COMMANDED BY LIEUTENANT PACHECHO MURDERED PEASANTS VICTOR MANUEL VASQUEZ AND RAFAEL ROMERO. THE TROOPS FAKED A CLASH AT HORCONES DE BERLIN CANTON TO MURDER THOSE PEASANTS. ON 4 JANUARY, LUCIA AND MARIA ASUNCION ROMERO, AND MINOR PEDRO GONZALEZ ERAZO WERE CAPTURED AT THE AHUACHAPAN BUS STATION BY ARMY TROOPS COMMANDED BY MURDERER COLONEL CANAS. THE PEASANT COMMUNAL ASSOCIATION, ACC, CONTINUES TO DEMAND THE RELEASE OF PEASANTS BARTOLO RODRIGUEZ, WHO WAS CAPTURED ON 27 JANUARY, AND CAPTURED ON 2 FEBRUARY BY TROOPS OF COLONAL ORLANDO MONTANO OF THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE. THE NONGOVERNMENTAL SALVADORAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION REPORTED THE SEIZURE OF MACLOVIA GONZALEZ, VIRGILIO ORTIZ CRUZ, AND VIRGILIO ORTIZ, WHO WERE CAPTURED ON 4 JANUARY BY MILITARY DETACHMENT NO 4 TROOPS AT EL MAYUELO CANTON, MORAZAN DEPARTMENT. THEIR WHEREABOUTS ARE STILL UNKNOWN. THE MPTL ALSO REPORTED THAT ROBERTO MENA WAS CAPTURED BY ATONAL BATTALION TROOPS AT 1600 ON 5 FEBRUARY. THERE CANNOT BE FREE AND CLEAN ELECTIONS IN THIS ATMOSPHERE OF REPRESSION. THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMY HIGH COMMAND CONTINUE TERRIFYING AND KILLING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. THE PEOPLES' WILL CANNOT BE EXPRESSED THROUGH THEIR VOTE WITH SUCH AN ATMOSPHERE OF REPRESSION, ESPECIALLY IF THE GROUPS DISPUTING POWER ARE A BUNCH OF MURDERERS AND CORRUPT MEN.
TST2-MUC4-0037	SAN SALVADOR, 17 NOV 89 -- SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE CANNOT BUT THANK YOU AND RECOGNIZE THE WAY IN WHICH YOU ARE BEARING THE FMLN AGGRESSION. WE TRULY HAVE A DUTY TOWARD THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND WE WILL GIVE YOU ALL OUR SUPPORT. WE ARE WILLING TO GIVE YOU EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN POSSIBLY GIVE YOU SO THAT CAN LIVE IN PEACE AND TRANQUILLITY. ECHOING THAT ATTITUDE, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE MUST ALSO HELP OUR SOLDIERS. WE MUST GIVE THEM ALL THE COOPERATION THEY NEED IN ORDER FOR THE CURRENT SITUATION TO END AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WE MUST CALL FOR NATIONAL UNITY. WE MUST ALL COOPERATE TO SAVE OUR HOMELAND FROM THE TERRORIST AGGRESSION. WE MUST ALL UNITE TO ACHIEVE PEACE AND TRANQUILLITY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, ALWAYS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE SITUATION OUR COUNTRY IS GOING THROUGH. WE MUST SUPPORT OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, OUR INSTITUTIONS, AND WE MUST TOTALLY REJECT THE FMLN TERRORIST FORCES. WE MUST FACE THOSE FORCES THROUGH A UNITED FRONT. WE CALL ON ALL OF OUR COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC AND POLITICAL FORCES TO FORM A UNITED FRONT; TO REJECT VIOLENCE AS A WAY OF SOLVING PROBLEMS IN EL SALVADOR; AND TO UNITE IN OUR ASPIRATION TO LIVE IN A DEMOCRACY AND IN PEACE, TRANQUILLITY, AND RESPECT FOR THE LAWS. BRIEFLY, WE MUST UNITE TO LIVE IN A DE JURE STATE IN WHICH THE PEOPLE CAN LIVE IN HARMONY AND TRANQUILLITY. IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY THAT ALL POLITICAL PARTIES JOIN EFFORTS, NOT AROUND A GOVERNMENT OR AN INSTITUTION, BUT FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO ACHIEVE THEIR DEAREST GOALS. WE ARE RECEIVING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S SUPPORT. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS SUPPORTING SALVADORAN DEMOCRACY. WE HAVE RECEIVED ENCOURAGING MESSAGES FROM COUNTRIES SUCH AS GREAT BRITAIN, WHICH HAS VIGOROUSLY CONDEMNED THE FMLN TERRORIST ACTION. WE HAVE RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM THE EEC, IN WHICH THAT GROUP IS TELLING THE FMLN THAT THE ARMED STRUGGLE IS NOT THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS AND THAT TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS, WE MUST FIRST HAVE PEACE AND THEN ACHIEVE THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THOSE GOALS MUST BE ATTAINED THROUGH A PEACE PROCESS. THE GOVERNMENT HAD ALREADY BEGAN THAT PROCESS AND THE FMLN TRIED TO BREAK IT. THE PEACE PROCESS MUST BE BASED ON THE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENT AND ESPECIALLY ON THE TELA AGREEMENT. WE HAVE ALSO WITNESSED HOW DIFFERENT POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL TENDENCIES HAVE BECOME UNIFIED IN OTHER COUNTRIES.
TST2-MUC4-0038	SANTIAGO, 14 DEC 89 -- UNFORTUNATELY MARRED BY A CARABINERO'S ASSASSINATION, WE HAVE RETURNED TO DEMOCRACY. PATRICIO AYLWIN HAS BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT OF CHILE. I CONGRATULATE HIM AND HIS FOLLOWERS, AND I WISH HIM SUCCESS IN HIS GOVERNMENT, FOR THE GOOD OF CHILE AND CHILEANS. HIS TRIUMPH IS NOT A DEFEAT FOR OUR IDEAS. MY CAMPAIGN WAS CONSTANTLY FOCUSED ON THE IDEA OF FREEDOM -- BOTH POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC -- PRIVATE PROPERTY, AND THE SOCIAL MARKET ECONOMY. IT HAD TO BE THIS WAY BECAUSE THIS IS THE FUTURE CHILEANS WANT, AND IF OUR IDEAS GAIN GROUND, THAT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE NAME OF THE MAN CHARGED WITH IMPLEMENTING THEM. BUT THOSE IDEAS MUST BE DISSEMINATED EVEN MORE WITH INCESSANT WORK. IN A DEMOCRACY, THE OPPOSITION ALSO GOVERNS. HISTORY HAS PLACED US IN THE CONSTRUCTIVE OPPOSITION FOR THE NEXT 4 YEARS. WE WILL BE WILLING TO COOPERATE FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY, BUT WE WILL STAY ALERT TO DEFEND OUR VISION OF THE FUTURE. I AM CONVINCED THAT AN INTELLIGENT OPPOSITION CAN DO MUCH FOR THE COUNTRY, PARTICULARLY IF THAT OPPOSITION IS BACKED BY THE NEARLY 2 MILLION PEOPLE WHO TODAY SUPPORTED MY CANDIDACY. THE WORK THAT LIES AHEAD WILL TO A LARGE EXTENT BE CARRIED OUT IN CONGRESS. THE INFORMATION NOW AVAILABLE SUGGESTS THAT THE PACT FOR DEMOCRACY AND PROGRESS HAS GAINED A VALUABLE REPRESENTATION IN BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS. LET MY CONGRATULATIONS GO TO THE FUTURE DEPUTIES AND SENATORS OF DEMOCRACY AND PROGRESS. I SEIZE THIS OCCASION TO LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY CAN COUNT ON MY SUPPORT. I AM SATISFIED WITH THE NUMBER OF VOTES I WON, CONSIDERING THE UNFAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES. I AM SATISFIED WITH THE ENTHUSIASTIC AND GENEROUS WORK CARRIED OUT BY MY ELECTORAL STAFF AND BY THE POLITICAL PARTIES. I THANK THEM FOR THEIR SUPPORT. I WANT TO ESPECIALLY THANK EACH OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO VOTED FOR ME. TO THE MILLIONS OF CHILEAN MEN AND WOMEN WHO IN SUNSHINE OR RAIN THROUGHOUT CHILE FILLED UP STADIUMS, PLAZAS, AND STREETS, CHANTING OUT SLOGANS FOR THE FUTURE; TO THOSE WHO SAW THE STREET WITH THE SYMBOL OF THE STAR OF HOPE; TO THOSE WHO PASTED MY PICTURE ON WALLS, WINDOWS, AND NOTEBOOKS; TO THOSE WHO ENCOURAGED ME IN THIS TIRESOME BUT MOVING CAMPAIGN WITH AN EMBRACE, A HANDSHAKE, OR A SMILE; TO ALL THOSE I WANT TO EXPRESS MY DEEPEST THANKS. I WILL KEEP THEM IN MY HEART FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. WHEN WE INITIATED THIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN -- AN HONOR THAT YOU KNOW I NEVER SOUGHT -- I TOLD MY FOLLOWERS THAT JUST LIKE CLIMBING A MOUNTAIN, THERE WERE MOMENTS OF ADVANCE, FATIGUE, AND FALLS, BUT I TRUSTED THAT, MUSTERING ALL OUR ENERGY, WE WOULD OUTDO OURSELVES AND REACH THE SUMMIT. I AM SATISFIED BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT EACH ONE OF US, AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS A POLITICAL FORCE, HAVE OUTDONE OURSELVES AND CLIMBED A LON WAY UP THE MOUNTAIN, BATTLING FOR OUR IDEAS AND FOR VOTES. WE DID NOT REACH THE SUMMIT, TRUE, BUT THIS MUST NOT DISMAY US. TODAY WE ARE CLOSER TO THE SUMMIT THAN WHEN WE STARTED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYONE. GOOD NIGHT.
TST2-MUC4-0039	BOGOTA, 13 FEB 90 -- THE STATE'S SECRET SERVICES STILL HAVE NO CLUES REGARDING THE TWO U.S. CITIZENS WHO WERE KIDNAPPED IN THE PAST FEW HOURS BY GUERRILLAS OF THE ELN DURING OPERATIONS IN MEDELLIN. THE VICTIMS WERE IDENTIFIED AS DAVID LECKY, DIRECTOR OF THE COLUMBUS SCHOOL, AND JAMES ARTHUR DONNELLY. BOTH WERE KIDNAPPED BY THE SO-CALLED NELSON MANDELA CELL OF THE ELN 48 HOURS BEFORE THE PRESIDENTIAL DRUG SUMMIT IN CARTAGENA. MADRID EFE IN SPANISH AT 2132 GMT ON 13 DECEMBER REPORTS THAT BOGOTA RADIO CADENA NACIONAL LISTS THE KIDNAP VICTIMS AS "LESLIE KENT, PROFESSOR OF THE COLUMBUS SCHOOL IN MEDELLIN, AND JAMES ARTHUR DONNELLY..."
TST2-MUC4-0040	BOGOTA, 17 JAN 90 -- 1. WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT THE PATRIOTIC INVITATION INCLUDED IN THE DOCUMENT SIGNED BY MONSIGNOR MARIO REVOLLO BRAVO AND BY THE DISTINGUISHED FORMER PRESIDENTS ALFONSO LOPEZ, JULIO CESAR TURBAY, AND MISAEL PASTRANA AS WELL AS BY PATRIOTIC UNION PRESIDENT DIEGO MONTANA CUELLAR. 2. TO RESPOND TO SUCH PROPOSALS, WE REITERATE OUR WELL-KNOWN PEACE COMMITMENTS EXPRESSED IN OUR MOST SINCERE AND FRANK STATEMENTS. 3. WE FULLY SHARE THE CRITERIA EXPRESSED BY THEM REGARDING THE SURVIVAL OF THE STATE AND GOVERNMENT, WHICH WAS DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED, AGAINST ORGANIZATIONS AND PEOPLE LIKE US, WHO HAVE SHOWN NO REGARD FOR THE LAW BY FIGHTING INSTITUTIONS AND THE LEGALLY ESTABLISHED ORDER. 4. AFTER EVALUATING OUR CONDUCT UNDER THE PREVIOUS CONCEPT, WE ARE ONLY INTERESTED IN PEACE, TRANQUILLITY, AND DEMOCRACY FOR OUR FATHERLAND AND FOR OUR PEOPLE. 5. AS A RESULT, WE ACCEPT THE VICTORY OF THE STATE, THE INSTITUTIONS, AND THE LEGALLY ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT. WE WILL LAY DOWN OUR WEAPONS AND OTHER MEANS OF STRUGGLE FOR THE SAKE OF THE COUNTRY'S BEST INTERESTS. 6. WE ACCEPT THE LEGAL ORDER THAT IS CURRENTLY IN FORCE WITH THE HOPE THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY WILL RESPECT OUR RIGHTS AND WILL ALLOW US TO RETURN TO OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. 7. AS AN ABSOLUTE PROOF OF OUR INTEREST IN ACHIEVING PEACE, WE HAVE DECIDED TO IMMEDIATELY RELEASE MRS PATRICIA ECHAVARRIA AND HER DAUGHTER AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING HELD HOSTAGE AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMIT. WE WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE CASES OF KIDNAPPED PEOPLE OF WHICH WE ARE ACCUSED. 8. WE OFFER OUR SERVICES AS MEDIATORS TO ACHIEVE PEACE WITH THE EMERALD TRAFFICKERS, THE SO-CALLED PARAMILITARY GROUPS, AND THE SO-CALLED HIRED ASSASSINS WITH THE ONLY PURPOSE OF ENDING THE VIOLENCE THAT IS HURTING OUR COLOMBIAN FATHERLAND. 9. WE HAVE DECIDED TO SUSPEND THE SHIPMENT OF DRUGS AND TO TURN IN OUR WEAPONS, EXPLOSIVES, LABORATORIES, CLANDESTINE LANDING STRIPS, AND OTHER ELEMENTS THAT ARE RELATED TO OUR ACTIVITIES AS SOON AS WE GET CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL GUARANTEES. 10. THERE WILL BE NO MORE BOMBINGS ANYWHERE ON NATIONAL TERRITORY AND WE HAVE ORDERED THE SUSPENSION OF ALL TYPES OF EXECUTIONS OF POLITICAL LEADERS, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, ASSOCIATION LEADERS, JUDICIAL OFFICIALS, JOURNALISTS, POLICEMEN, AND SOLDIERS. 11. THE ESSENTIAL REASON FOR OUR STRUGGLE HAS BEEN AND WILL ALWAYS BE OUR FAMILIES, OUR FREEDOM, OUR PEOPLE, OUR LIVES, AND OUR RIGHTS AS CITIZENS OF THIS FATHERLAND. THE EXTRADITABLES, 16 JANUARY 1990
TST2-MUC4-0041	SAN SALVADOR, 12 NOV 89 -- BRAVE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, ON THIS OCCASION AND AS DEFENSE AND PUBLIC SECURITY MINISTER, PROFESSIONAL SOLDIER, AND A SALVADORAN CITIZEN, I AM VERY PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO BRING YOU THIS MESSAGE. ABOVE ALL, THIS MESSAGE CONVEYS OUR MOST RESPECTFUL AND THOUGHFUL GREETINGS TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND OUR HOPES THAT, DURING THIS TROUBLED TIME, YOU WILL REMAIN CALM AND HAVE CONFIDENCE AND FAITH IN YOUR ARMED FORCES. A FEW MOMENTS AGO, YOU HEARD THE VOICE OF THE FIRST SOLDIER OF OUR GLORIOUS ARMED FORCES, THE VOICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND GENERAL COMMANDER OF THE ARMED FORCES. AT THIS TIME, I WISH TO EXPRESS THE FEELINGS OF EACH AND EVERY MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES, OF THE INSTITUTION THAT AT THIS MOMENT IS BEING INSTITUTIONALLY CHALLENGED. WE, AS SOLDIERS BORN OF THIS PEOPLE TO SERVE THIS PEOPLE, EXPRESS OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THAT MESSAGE OF CONFIDENCE, SECURITY, AND HOPE SENT BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC. EVERYONE HAS HEARD ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN OUR COUNTRY IN THE PAST 48 HOURS. NO CONSCIENTIOUS CITIZEN, NO REAL SALVADORAN, IS UNAWARE OF THE AGGRESSION TO WHICH WE HAVE ONCE AGAIN BEEN SUBJECTED BY THE F M L N'S TREACHEROUS TERRORIST FORCES. EVIDENTLY, THIS ACTION, THIS TERRORORIST ACTION, IS ONLY AIMED AT CAUSING PAIN AND SORROW FOR THE PEOPLE AND AT DESTROYING THE REAL FEELINGS, INSPIRATION, AND WILL OF THE PEOPLE. ON THIS OCCASION, THE ARMED FORCES STEP FORWARD TO DEFEND THE PEOPLE, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DEMANDING THE OBLITERATION OF THESE TERRORIST AND COWARDLY FORCES. THE ATTITUDE OF OUR COURAGEOUS PEOPLE, THE ATTITUDE OF THE PEOPLE WHO TODAY ARE WRITING ONE OF THE MOST BRILLIANT PAGES IN OUR HISTORY, CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE ARMED FORCES, GUARANTOR OF SECURITY, ORDER, AND TRANQUILITY, TO SAY: SALVADORAN PEOPLE, THE ARMED FORCES ARE WITH YOU; THE ARMED FORCES ASSUME THEIR PROFESSIONAL DUTY OF DEFENDING THE MOST SACRED INTERESTS OF OUR HOMELAND, OF OUR COUNTRY, EL SALVADOR. THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, AS AN INSTITUTION, HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN THEIR DUTY AND TODAY REITERATE THEIR ABSOLUTE WILLINGNESS AND DETERMINATION TO MAKE THE BIGGEST SACRIFICE IF THIS BECOMES NECESSARY, SO THAT YOU, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, CAN ASPIRE TO A FUTURE FULL OF HAPPINESS AND WELL-BEING. WE PRAISE THE DETERMINATION OF THE PEOPLE. WE APPLAUD AND CONGRATULATE THE PEOPLE FOR THEIR DETERMINATION AND THE STOICISM WITH WHICH THEY, THE BRAVE SALVADORAN CITIZENS, HAVE CONFRONTED THESE MOMENTS OF TRAGEDY AND CHALLENGE. WE SAY: SALVADORAN PEOPLE, THIS INSTITUTION -- YOUR ARMED FORCES -- IS AT YOUR SIDE. THE ARMED FORCES ARE WILLING TO SHED THEIR BLOOD AND GIVE THEIR LIVES PRECISELY SO THAT THE CHILDREN OF OUR PEOPLE, SO THAT THE CHILDREN OF OUR CHILDREN, CAN ASPIRE TO A WORTHY, FREE, JUST, AND INDEPENDENT LIFE. WE WISH TO CONGRATULATE OUR PEOPLE FOR THEIR ATTITUDE. WE WISH TO CONGRATULATE ALL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE BECAUSE, WITH THEIR WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT SENT TO US THROUGH DIFFERENT MEANS, THE INSTITUTION FEELS STRONGER AND MORE WILLING TO DEFEND THE REAL ASPIRATIONS OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. THIS BRAVE ATTITUDE -- THIS ATTITUDE THAT REFLECTS THE REAL SALVADORANS -- IS, WITHOUT DOUBT, THE STRONGEST RESPONSE AND THE WORST PUNISHMENT THE TERRORIST FORCES COULD RECEIVE.
TST2-MUC4-0042	BOGOTA, 15 DEC 89 -- GENERAL CARLOS ARTURO CASADIEGO TORRADO, SECOND IN COMMAND OF THE COLOMBIAN POLICE, HAS REPORTED THE DEATH OF GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA. GENERAL GOMEZ PADILLA, WHO IS IN CALI, WILL TRAVEL TO BOGOTA AND WILL SOON HOLD A NEWS CONFERENCE TO PROVIDE MORE DETAILS ON THE DEATH OF THIS CRIMINAL. IN AN INTERVIEW, GEN CASADIEGO TORRADO INFORMED RCN OF THE OPERATION MOUNTED IN THE AREA WHERE THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY THOSE OPERATING IN THAT AREA THAT RODRIGUEZ GACHA, HIS SON, AND THE PEOPLE WITH THEM HAVE BEEN KILLED. THAT IS THE INFORMATION WE HAVE AVAILABLE. WE DO NOT HAVE DETAILS ON THE OPERATION YET. IT WAS THE RESULT OF LONG-TERM INTELLIGENCE WORK CARRIED OUT WITH GREAT PROFESSIONALISM, WHICH GAVE US INFORMATION ON WHERE HE COULD BE FOUND. WE DEPLOYED SPECIAL GROUPS TO CARRY OUT THAT TASK. GENERAL, EXACTLY WHERE DID THE OPERATION, IN WHICH RODRIGUEZ GACHA, HIS SON, AND 15 OTHERS WERE KILLED, TAKE PLACE? IN A RURAL AREA, AS YOU KNOW, IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. I DO NOT KNOW THE EXACT LOCATION. HAS IT BEEN OFFICIALLY REPORTED THAT RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND HIS SON WERE KILLED? IS THIS AN OFFICIAL REPORT FROM THE NATIONAL POLICE? THAT IS THE INFORMATION I HAVE. THAT IS THE INFORMATION I HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE SCENE OF THE INCIDENT. WHO ARE THE OTHER 15 PEOPLE KILLED? WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED THEM YET. OFFICIALS ARE TRAVELING TO THE SITE TO OFFICIALLY IDENTIFY THE BODIES. WERE THEY ASSISTANTS, BODYGUARDS, ESCORTS? YES, WE ARE SURE OF THAT. HAVE WEAPONS OR OTHER ITEMS BEEN CONFISCATED? WE HAVE HEARD THAT IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS WERE FOUND. YES, WE KNOW THAT WEAPONS WERE FOUND WHICH WERE USED TO PROTECT THIS MAN. HOWEVER, AS I SAID, WE DO NOT HAVE THE DETAILS ON THE INCIDENT YET. WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND HIS SON WERE KILLED, AS WELL AS OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE WITH HIM. WHO ELSE IS THERE? IS THERE A COMMISSION OF JUDGES? WE UNDERSTAND THAT A FEW MOMENTS AGO A PLANE DEPARTED WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE DIRECTORATE AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. I DO NOT KNOW IF REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE DIRECTORATE HAVE TRAVELED THERE. WE SENT POLICE INSPECTORS, JUDGES, AND WE KNOW THAT THE COMMANDERS OF THE THREE NEIGHBORING DEPARTMENTS WILL ALSO BE THERE. HOW WAS THE OPERATION PLANNED, AND HAS THE PRESIDENT BEEN INFORMED? AS I SAID, THIS OPERATION IS THE RESULT OF ARDUOUS WORK BY THE NATIONAL POLICE. IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT MISSION. FOR A LONG TIME WE HAVE BEEN CARRYING OUT THESE TYPES OF OPERATIONS. WE ARE STILL DOING THIS TYPE OF WORK AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO.
TST2-MUC4-0043	SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE -- THE FMLN WILL MAINTAIN THESE UNILATERAL ACTIONS DURING A SUFFICIENT AND MODERATE PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES TO CARRY OUT THE CORRESPONDING ACTIONS THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO CREATING A SERIOUS CLIMATE FOR NEGOTIATIONS. IN THIS SENSE, WE DEMAND THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES TO: 1. IMMEDIATELY CEASE REPRESSION, STOP ASSASSINATIONS, ARRESTS, USE OF TORTURE ON POLITICAL PRISONERS, SECURITY CORPS ACTIONS AGAINST DEMONSTRATIONS, STRIKES, AND OTHER PEOPLE'S ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO DEMAND THE LIFTING OF THE SIEGE AGAINST THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, LABOR UNION OFFICES, AND OFFICES OF OTHER PEOPLE'S ORGANIZATIONS, AND AN END TO SEARCHES AGAINST THESE ORGANIZATIONS. 2. PERMIT THE IMMEDIATE REPATRIATION OF ALL REFUGEES, WITH NO RESTRICTIONS, TO THE PLACES THEY SELECT. TO LIFT THE SIEGE AND RESTRICTIONS ON THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AT THE ALREADY ESTABLISHED RESETTLEMENTS, AND ON THE CONFLICT AREAS WHERE THE ARMY PREVENTS THE ARRIVAL OF SUPPLIES. 3. CEASE THE ATTACKS ON THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IN THE FORM OF ASSASSINATIONS, INTIMIDATION, AND DISMISSAL OF NEWSMEN, AND PRESSURE ON THE MEDIA IN GENERAL. 4. SUSPEND CONSCRIPTION, WHICH IS CARRIED OUT ONLY AMONG THE LOW INCOME SECTORS OF THE POPULATION. 5. STOP USING LAND MINES AND BOOBY TRAPS, WHICH HAVE CAUSED HUNDREDS OF CASUALTIES ATTRIBUTED TO THE FMLN. STOP BOMBING CIVILIAN TARGETS AND INHABITED AREAS. THE FMLN, IN TURN, AGREES TO STOP ACTIONS THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT THE GOVERNMENT'S WAR ECONOMY AND IMBALANCE THE ARMY'S DEFENSIVE SYSTEM. THE FMLN AGREES TO STOP USING SUCH WEAPONS AS THE MINES THAT HAVE INFLICTED THOUSANDS OF CASUALTIES ON THE ARMY. SOME OF THESE ACTIONS HAVE AFFECTED THE POPULATION, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. WE DEMAND THAT THE GOVERNMENT STOP USING REPRESSIVE MEASURES THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT THE POPULATION AND THEIR DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS. WE WILL NOT, HOWEVER, ACCEPT AS A GOVERNMENT GOODWILL GESTURE OUR WAR DISABLED LEAVING THE COUNTRY FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT, IF AND WHEN THIS DEPARTURE TAKES PLACE. WE REGARD THIS AS A BASIC HUMANITARIAN RIGHT SUBJECT TO INTERNATIONAL ACCORDS, SUCH AS THE GENEVA CONVENTION, SIGNED AND RATIFIED BY THE SALVADORAN STATE. THE FULFILLMENT OF THESE ACCORDS HAS BEEN DEMANDED FROM THE GOVERNMENT BY VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS AND THE LATEST UN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION RESOLUTION. AS OF TODAY, WE WILL BE WATCHING THE ACTIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES ON THE FIVE POINTS PROPOSED. WE INVITE THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES TO DEMONSTRATE TRUE WILLINGNESS FOR PEACE BY TAKING THE ACTIONS WE HAVE PROPOSED AND INITIATING A SERIOUS NEGOTIATING PROCESS TO END THE WAR. FMLN GENERAL COMMAND. EL SALVADOR, 7 SEPTEMBER 1989.
TST2-MUC4-0044	CARACAS , 27 OCT 89 -- THE ATTACK IN WHICH FIVE VENEZUELAN SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AT THE BORDER WITH COLOMBIA HAS BEEN BLAMED, ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS, ON COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS AND DRUG TRAFFICKING GANGS OPERATING IN COLOMBIA. VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ BLAMED COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKING GANGS FOR THE ATTACK -- IN WHICH FIVE GUARDS WERE KILLED -- PERPETRATED ON 26 OCTOBER IN THE BORDER STATE OF APURE AGAINST A NATIONAL GUARD PATROL IN THE AREA. REFERRING LAST NIGHT TO THE DRUG TRAFFICKING GANGS, PEREZ SAID THIS IS "A PROVOCATION FOR VENEZUELA BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO EXTEND THEIR CLAWS TO OUR COUNTRY." HOWEVER, JORGE ROMERO, GOVERNOR OF THE BORDER STATE OF TACHIRA, WHICH BORDERS THE STATE OF APURE, MAINTAINED THIS WAS AN "ATTACK WITH VERY POWERFUL EXPLOSIVES" PERPETRATED BY "MEMBERS OF THE COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS, PRESUMABLY FROM THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY, AGAINST A NATIONAL GUARD JEEP." ACCORDING TO ROMERO, IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED DURING THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS THAT THE EXPLOSIVES THAT KILLED THE FIVE SOLDIERS WERE BURIED IN A ROAD NEAR CUTUFI, AND SET OFF BY REMOTE CONTROL AS THE MILITARY VEHICLE PASSED BY. LAST NIGHT, THE DEFENSE MINISTRY ORDERED THE ARREST OF FIVE ALLEGED COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS, WHOM IT BLAMED FOR THE ATTACK. HOWEVER, THE ATTACKERS REPORTEDLY CROSSED THE BORDER INTO COLOMBIA.
TST2-MUC4-0045	SAN SALVADOR, 31 MAY 89 -- THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES TODAY ANNOUNCED THE SEIZURE OF A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF WEAPONS FROM THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GUERRILLAS AT A SAFE HOUSE IN THE NORTHERN SECTION OF THIS CAPITAL. ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, THE ARSENAL IS THE LARGEST ONE SEIZED FROM THE GUERRILLAS OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS. A POLICE OFFICER STRESSED THAT THE WEAPONS -- 348 SOVIET-MADE AK-47 RIFLES, 118 AUTOMATIC PISTOLS, 29 GRENADE LAUNCHERS, APPROXIMATELY 159 AMMUNITION SACKS, SWORDS, FRAGMENTATION GRENADES, AND OVER 100 EXPLOSIVE BLOCKS WITH DETONATORS AND SLOW-BURNING FUSES -- WERE AMONG THE SUPPLIES FOUND IN AN FMLN WAREHOUSE IN SAN SALVADOR. A OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE NOTED THAT "MILITARY INTELLIGENCE SERVICES HAVE LEARNED THAT TERRORIST GROUPS WERE SMUGGLING SOVIET-MADE WEAPONS FROM NICARAGUA IN SPECIALLY-OUTFITTED TRAILERS TO EQUIP THE URBAN COMMANDOS AS WELL AS THE MILITIAS TO ENABLE THEM TO COMMIT TERRORIST ACTS ON 1 JUNE." SALVADORAN PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI OF THE RIGHTIST NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE WILL ASSUME THIS COUNTRY'S PRESIDENCY TOMORROW; THE ARMED FORCES HAVE DEPLOYED 10,000 TROOPS FOR THE CEREMONY.
TST2-MUC4-0046	BOGOTA, 27 NOV 89 -- ... IF THE COLLEAGUES AT THE CENTRAL STUDIO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE BOGOTA ELECTRICAL ENERGY INSTITUTE EMPLOYEE WHO WAS AT THE SITE OF THE INCIDENT. WE ARE OBSERVING A TERRIBLE SCENE OF DESOLATION AND DEATH BECAUSE ALL THE PASSANGERS GOING TO CALI, VALLE DEL CAUCA DEPARTMENT, DIED. THERE IS NO SINGLE SURVIVOR ACCORDING TO NATIONAL POLICE REPORTS. THEY ARE AWAITING CRIMINAL INSTRUCTION JUDGES. HOWEVER, THE ELECTRICITY COMPANY WORKER MAY ANSWER QUESTIONS POSED BY STUDIO REPORTERS. LATER ON WE WILL HAVE MORE OFFICIAL INFORMATION. CAN YOU CONFIRM THE ARRIVAL OF THE POLICE'S BOMB SQUAD? AUTHORITIES FEAR THE CRASH MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY AN EXPLOSION RATHER THAN AN ACCIDENT INSIDE THE AIRPLANE. THE F-2 JUDICIAL POLICE AND CRIMINAL STATISTICS EXPERTS ARE HERE. THEY FEEL THAT THE ACCIDENT MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A TERRORIST ACTION. THE REMARK WAS MADE BASED ON WITNESS ACCOUNTS. THEY NOTED THAT THIS MAY HAVE BEEN A TERRORIST ATTACK BECAUSE AIRPLANES DO NOT HAVE THIS KIND OF ACCIDENT UNLESS THERE IS AN EXPLOSION, SOMETHING THAT HAS VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. ACCORDING TO REPORTS BY THE NATIONAL POLICE F-2 EXPERTS, THE AIRPLANE BROKE INTO SIX PIECES. IT IS COMPLETELY DESTROYED, WHICH IS WHY THE 106 PASSENGERS ABOARD ARE STREWN ACROSS AN AREA 6-8 KM WIDE. ACCESS TO THE AIRPLANE'S REMAINS IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE THIS IS A MOUNTAINOUS REGION. THE CASQUITO IS THROUGH THE ROAD THAT GOES FROM BOSA, CUNDINAMARCA DEPARTMENT, TO THE SCHOOL . AUTHORITIES SAY THAT THIS AREA IS LOCATED VERY CLOSE TO SLUICE NUMBER 3, MUNA 3, WHICH FEEDS WATER TO THE DAM. THE SITUATION IS VERY DIFFICULT AND DRAMATIC. RIGHT NOW, EXPERTS ARE COLLECTING SAMPLES AND TRYING FIND ALL THEY CAN TO LEARN FOR SURE IF THIS WAS A TERRORIST ACTION OR A SERIOUS ACCIDENT CAUSED BY A FLAW IN THE MECHANICAL SYSTEM OF THE HK-1803 AIRPLANE.
TST2-MUC4-0047	BOGOTA, 29 OCT 89 -- THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS EXTRADITED TO THE UNITED STATES FIVE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE LAST FEW HOURS, INCLUDING JOSE RAFAEL AVELLO SILVA, ALSO KNOWN AS EL MONO AVELLO. THE AUTHORITIES REPORTED THAT AVELLO IS WANTED BY A U.S. COURT FOR COMMITING MANY CRIMES, INCLUDING CONSPIRACY AND COMPLICITY IN CRIMES AGAINST THE U.S. ECONOMY. THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS REOPENED THE PROCESS OF EXTRADITION VIA ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS AFTER THE LAW ON EXTRADITIONS WAS STRUCK DOWN BY THE SUPREME COURT.

TST2-MUC4-0048	SAN SALVADOR, 19 APR 89 -- SALVADORAN PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI CONDEMNED THE TERRORIST KILLING OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO AND ACCUSED THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT OF THE CRIME. LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY PRESIDENT RICARDO VALDIVIESO AND VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT FRANCISCO MERINO ALSO DECLARED THAT THE DEATH OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS CAUSED BY WHAT VALDIVIESO TERMED THE GUERRILLAS' "IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE." GARCIA ALVARADO, 56, WAS KILLED WHEN A BOMB PLACED BY URBAN GUERRILLAS ON HIS VEHICLE EXPLODED AS IT CAME TO A HALT AT AN INTERSECTION IN DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR. "WE HAVE TO CONDEMN THIS INCIDENT, IT IS A GUERRILLA ACT," ALFREDO CRISTIANI, NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE PRESIDENT-ELECT, WHO WILL REPLACE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE ON 1 JUNE, STATED. CRISTIANI SAID THAT "THESE ARE THE RISKS FACED BY SOMEONE WHO ENFORCES THE LAW." HE NOTED THAT "THE GUERRILLAS' IRRATIONAL ATTITUDE MAKES IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THEY WANT PEACE." ACCORDING TO CRISTIANI, THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE BECAUSE ATTORNEY GENERAL GARCIA ALVARADO WARNED THAT "HE WOULD TAKE MEASURES AGAINST URBAN TERRORISTS." VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT FRANCISCO MERINO SAID THAT WHEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S CAR STOPPED AT A LIGHT ON A STREET IN DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR, AN INDIVIDUAL PLACED A BOMB ON THE ROOF OF THE ARMORED VEHICLE. "THE DRIVER TOLD THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ABOUT THE BOMB. THE VEHICLE SWERVED AND THE BOMB EXPLODED, CAUSING THE TOP OF THE VEHICLE TO COLLAPSE ON THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S HEAD," MERINO STATED. GUERRILLAS ATTACKED MERINO'S HOME IN SAN SALVADOR 5 DAYS AGO WITH EXPLOSIVES. THERE WERE SEVEN CHILDREN, INCLUDING FOUR OF THE VICE PRESIDENT'S CHILDREN, IN THE HOME AT THE TIME. A 15-YEAR-OLD NIECE OF MERINO'S WAS INJURED. "THESE INCIDENTS," CRISTIANI SAID, "FRANKLY CAUSE US TO BECOME MORE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT WE MUST NOT PERMIT TERRORIST ACTIONS TO OCCUR IN EL SALVADOR." THE PRESIDENT-ELECT RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THESE ATTACKS "WILL PREVENT THE INAUGURAL CEREMONY FROM TAKING PLACE." "I AM CERTAIN THAT THE INAUGURATION WILL BE ON 1 JUNE. WE WILL NOT JUMP OVERBOARD OR MAKE A RUN FOR IT. WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE UP AGAINST AND WILL GO ON," HE STATED. CRISTIANI SAID THE GUERRILLA ATTACKS ARE INTENDED TO PROMPT A GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY REACTION SO THE FMLN CAN "EXPLOIT IT" ABROAD TO "POLITICALLY ISOLATE THE NEW GOVERNMENT." RICARDO VALDIVIESO, PRESIDENT OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSSEMBLY AND AN ARENA LEADER, SAID THE FMLN AND ITS "FRONT" GROUPS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE "IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE THAT KILLED ATTORNEY GENERAL GARCIA." VALDIVIESO SAID THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY WILL APPROVE DRASTIC LAWS TO "HALT THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE." HE SAID THE ATTORNEY GENERAL "WAS APOLITICAL, WORKED FOR JUSTICE, AND DID NOT DESERVE TO DIE LIKE THAT." ACCORDING TO THE POLICE AND GARCIA ALVARADO'S DRIVER, WHO ESCAPED UNSCATHED, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS TRAVELING WITH TWO BODYGUARDS. ONE OF THEM WAS INJURED. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S BODY WAS DESTROYED BY THE BOMB THAT EXPLODED OVER HIS HEAD. NO GROUP HAS CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE ATTACK YET, BUT POLICE SOURCES CLAIM IT "IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE FMLN URBAN COMMANDOS." THE SAME SOURCES CONFIRMED THAT GARCIA ALVARADO HAD BEEN THREATENED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS BY SALVADORAN URBAN GUERRILLAS. MOMENTS AFTER THE ATTACK, ARMY AND POLICE UNITS CORDONED OFF THE AREA AND BEGAN AN ALL-OUT MILITARY OPERATION TO FIND THOSE RESPONSIBLE. GARCIA ALVARADO, FATHER OF SIX, WAS APPOINTED ATTORNEY GENERAL ON 23 DECEMBER 1988. HE WAS CONSIDERED TO BE CLOSELY LINKED TO ARENA. ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, HOWEVER, HE SAID HE DID NOT REPRESENT ANY PARTY AND WAS CARRYING OUT HIS JOB "IMPARTIALLY AND WITH THE INTENTION OF ENFORCING THE COUNTRY'S LAWS."

THE SUPREME COURT DECLARED THE FOLLOWING DECREE UNCONSTITUTIONAL: THE SYSTEM BEING USED TO RAID, CONFISCATE, OCCUPY, AND EXPROPRIATE PROPERTY. ACCORDING TO THE SUPREME COURT, THE MECHANISM BEING USED WAS ADMINISTRATIVE AND IT SHOULD BE DONE JUDICIALLY, BY ORDER OF A JUDGE.
TST2-MUC4-0052	TEL AVIV , 27 AUG 89 -- EDUCATION MINISTER YITZHAQ NAVON TODAY DEMANDED IN THE CABINET SESSION THAT THE GOVERNMENT RETURN ALL ISRAELIS WHO ILLEGALLY PROVIDE MILITARY TRAINING ABROAD. THE GOVERNMENT MUST PUT AN END TO THE DISGRACE SOME ISRAELIS CAUSE TO ALL OF US. HERE IS A REPORT BY OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT NATAN GUTMAN: THE WEEKLY CABINET SESSION DEALT WITH THE COLOMBIA ISSUE ONLY BRIEFLY. DEFENSE MINISTER YITZHAQ RABIN BRIEFLY REFERRED TO THE ISSUE MAINLY BECAUSE HE WAS ASKED BY OTHER MINISTERS TO DO SO. DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER YITZHAQ NAVON SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT MUST PUT AN END TO THE DISGRACE CAUSED BY SOME ISRAELIS. DEFENSE MINISTER RABIN MERELY STATED THAT THE WHOLE ISSUE OF THE INVOLVEMENT OF ISRAELIS IN COLOMBIA IS UNDER INVESTIGATION. DEFENSE ELEMENTS MADE CLEAR AT THE MEETING THAT SINCE 1986 THERE HAS BEEN A NEED TO ACQUIRE A SPECIFIC PERMIT FOR ANY SECURITY ACTIVITY BY AN ISRAELI BODY ABROAD. IT WAS FURTHER MADE CLEAR THAT THE HOD HAHANIT COMPANY DID NOT HAVE SUCH A PERMIT, AND HAS BEEN WARNED NOT TO OPERATE IN COLOMBIA. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE SESSION, CABINET SECRETARY ELYAQIM RUBINSTEIN SAID THAT THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT DISASSOCIATES ITSELF FROM ANY SUCH ACTIVITY. IT WAS FURTHER STRESSED THAT ISRAEL CONSIDERS THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE PLAGUE OF INTERNATIONAL DRUGS A VERY IMPORTANT QUEST. AS FOR THE SITUATION IN THE TERRITORIES, THE DEFENSE MINISTER EXPLAINED THAT THE FEELING OF A DEADLOCKED POLITICAL PROCESS LEADS TO AN ESCALATION OF THE INTIFADAH . IT WAS STRESSED THAT THE MASKED MEN CREATE A REAL LEGAL PROBLEM. MINISTER SCIAKI SUGGESTED THAT ORDERS BE ISSUED TO ALLOW SHOOTING AT MASKED MEN IF SUSPICIONS WARRANT. FINANCE MINISTER SHIM'ON PERES' DRAFT LAW ON STREAMLINING BUREAUCRACY WAS APPROVED TODAY IN THE CABINET BY A LARGE MAJORITY OF 14 TO 2. SHARP EXCHANGES BETWEEN THE FINANCE MINISTER AND SOME LIKUD MINISTERS TOOK PLACE. OUR ECONOMIC CORRESPONDENT YARON KULAS REPORTS: THE DEBATE ON THE DRAFT LAW ON SLASHING BUREAUCRACY REOPENED THE LOUD DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FINANCE MINISTER AND LIKUD MINISTERS MOSHE NISIM, RONI MILO, AND EHUD OLMERT. ONLY TWO MINISTERS OBJECTED TO THE PROPOSAL: 'EZER WEIZMAN, WHO SAID THAT THE TRUE ECONOMIC PROBLEM TODAY IS THE INTIFADAH; AND ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION MINISTER RONI MILO. TEN MINISTERS ABSTAINED FROM VOTING. THE PLAN WAS ENDORSED, HOWEVER, BY A LARGE MAJORITY. THE KNESSET WILL CONVENE TO RATIFY THE DRAFT LAW EARLY NEXT WEEK.
TST2-MUC4-0053	CARACAS , 15 JUL 89 -- VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ' BROTHER-IN-LAW WAS KIDNAPPED IN COLOMBIA, ACCORDING TO FAMILY SOURCES IN CARACAS. A REPORT BROADCAST ON A PRIVATE TELEVISION CHANNEL STATED THAT UNIDENTIFIED ASSAILANTS KIDNAPPED NORBERTO RODRIGUEZ -- BROTHER OF VENEZUELA'S FIRST LADY BLANCA RODRIGUEZ DE PEREZ -- IN COLOMBIA'S NORTHERN SANTANDER DEPARTMENT, WHERE HE WAS TENDING TO PERSONAL MATTERS. ACCORDING TO THE TELEVISION REPORT, THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT CONTACTED COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION ON THE INCIDENT. NO REASONS WERE GIVEN AS TO WHY RODRIGUEZ' RELATIVES FEAR THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED.
TST2-MUC4-0054	SAN SALVADOR, 8 JAN 90 -- THE RECTOR OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY , FATHER MIGUEL FRANCISCO ESTRADA, HAS DESCRIBED THE GOVERNMENT'S REPORT THAT ARMED FORCES ELEMENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE KILLING OF SIX UCA PRIESTS AS MOST IMPORTANT, ALTHOUGH HE ALSO NOTED THAT THE REPORT IS INCOMPLETE. I BELIEVE IT IS INCOMPLETE BECAUSE WE DO NOT YET KNOW WHO COMMITTED THE CRIMES. WE ONLY KNOW THAT THEY BELONG TO AN INSTITUTION, AND THIS OF COURSE IS ONLY PARTIAL INFORMATION. DID YOU KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS GOING TO MAKE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT LAST NIGHT, OR WAS IT A SURPRISE? I THINK IT WAS A SURPRISE BECAUSE WE HAD BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE PRESIDENT AND WITH THE CRIME COMMISSION, WHICH IS THE ONE CARRYING OUT THE INVESTIGATIONS ON ORDERS FROM THE PRESIDENT AND THE GOVERNMENT. THEY PROMISED US THAT IF WE WERE TO COOPERATE BY PROVIDING INFORMATION, THEY WOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM AND CARRY OUT THE INVESTIGATIONS. AT THAT POINT I WAS SKEPTICAL, BECAUSE THE PERSONS WHO HAVE TESTIFIED HAVE ACCUSED THE ARMED FORCES, AND I HAD NEVER SEEN A SALVADORAN PRESIDENT OR THE ARMED FORCES MAKING A SERIOUS EFFORT TO CLEAN UP ITS IMAGE AND CARRY OUT INVESTIGTIONS TO PUT MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES IN PRISON. I WAS SKEPTICAL. I HAD NEVER SEEN THAT HAPPEN, BUT FACTS SHOW THAT I WAS MISTAKEN. FATHER ESTRADA HAS ADMITTED THAT THERE HAS BEEN INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE TO HAVE THIS CASE INVESTIGATED, BUT HE OPTIMISTICALLY BELIEVES THAT THE DECISION TO INVESTIGATE HAS BEEN ADOPTED ALSO FOR THE SAKE OF THE PRESTIGE OF THE ARMED FORCES. I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE ACTING NOT ONLY AS A RESULT OF PRESSURE, BUT ALSO BECAUSE THEY COULD BE DENIED MILITARY OR ECONOMIC AID. I BELIEVE THAT A CRIME SUCH AS THE ONE BEING INVESTIGATED GOES AGAINST THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE ARMED FORCES, WHICH EXISTS TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS, NOT TO HARM THEM. FATHER ESTRADA SAID HE TRUSTS IN THE MORAL STRENGTH OF PRESIDENT CRISTIANI TO SEE THIS CASE THROUGH TO THE END. HE CAUTIONED, HOWEVER, THAT SO FAR NOTHING NEW HAS BEEN SAID AND THAT A LISTING OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED AND A JUST SENTENCE WOULD BE NEWS.
TST2-MUC4-0055	LIMA, 5 OCT 89 -- IN LIMA TODAY, UNOFFICIAL SOURCES REPORTED THAT AT LEAST 2,500 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DETAINED BY THE PERUVIAN POLICE IN RAIDS CARRIED OUT IN SEARCH OF HECTOR DELGADO PARKER, A LOCAL TELEVISION IMPRESARIO, AND HIS KIDNAPPERS.

DELGADO PARKER WAS KIDNAPPED IN DOWNTOWN LIMA WEDNESDAY BY A COMMANDO OF THE PRO-CHE GUEVARA GROUP TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT . AS A RESULT OF THE TERRORIST ACTION, DELGADO'S DRIVER WAS KILLED, AND DELGADO'S BODYGUARD WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED, WHILE DELGADO HIMSELF WAS VIOLENTLY ABDUCTED BY THE MRTA ACTIVISTS. ACCORDING TO THE SOURCES, THE RAIDS CARRIED OUT BY THE POLICE, WHO DETAIN PEOPLE WITHOUT IDENTIFICATION PAPERS AND SUSPECTS AFTER CHECKING ON PEDESTRIANS AND VEHICLES, TOOK PLACE ON LIMA'S ACCESS ROADS AS WELL AS IN SOME SUBURBAN AREAS OF THIS CITY AND EVEN IN DOWNTOWN LIMA. THE PERUVIAN NATIONAL POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT SOME 2,000 AGENTS OF THE ANTITERRORIST DIRECTORATE AND THE KIDNAPPING DIVISION ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE SEARCH OPERATIONS ORDERED BY PRESIDENT GARCIA. IN TELEPHONE CALLS TO LIMA MEDIA, THE MRTA HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE KIDPANAPPING OF HECTOR DELGADO PARKER.

TST2-MUC4-0056	SAN SALVADOR, 19 MAR 89 -- DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL EUGENIO VIDES CASANOVA HAS VISITED LA ALAMEDA ROOSEVELT TO OBSERVE THE VOTING PROCESS. HE ALSO SAID AN INVESTIGATION WILL BE CONDUCTED INTO THE MURDERS OF THREE REPORTERS, TWO SALVADORANS AND A NETHERLANDER. THERE WILL ALSO BE AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE WOUNDING OF A SALVADORAN REPORTER AND A CBS REPORTER. THIS IS THE SAME QUESTION ASKED . THE ELECTION PROCESS IS PROCEEDING NORMALLY IN ALL MUNICIPALITIES EXCEPT SEVEN. CLASHES WERE REPORTED IN TWO MUNICIPALITIES AND THE ELECTIONS WERE SUSPENDED IN TWO OTHERS. ONE OF THEM IS EL SAUCE, WITH WHICH COMMUNICATIONS HAVE BEEN CUT OFF. THE OTHER IS SANTA ELENA, WHERE A CLASH OCCURRED. I THINK PEOPLE WILL VOTE HERE LATER. NO VOTING IS TAKING PLACE IN FOUR OTHER MUNICIPALITIES. I HAVE NO OTHER INFORMATION. AT THE TIME I DEPARTED, I SENT FOR REPORTS FROM THE HOSPITAL. I WAS TOLD HE DIED, BUT WE HAVE TO GATHER MORE DATA ON HOW THE INCIDENT HAPPENED. WE HAVE ALWAYS HELD REPORTERS IN THE HIGHEST REGARD. ALL ARMED FORCES MEMBERS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THIS. BUT PROBLEMS ARISE WHEN SOME PEOPLE IGNORE CHECKPOINTS AND THE GUARDS TRY TO STOP THEM. I HEREBY APPEAL TO PEOPLE TO OBEY CHECKPOINTS. WE ARE THE FIRST TO REGRET THESE INCIDENTS. WE HAVE VERY GOOD AND CLOSE RELATIONS WITH THE MEDIA AND KNOW . WILL THIS HAVE REPERCUSSIONS? SERIOUS REPERCUSSIONS WILL CERTAINLY OCCUR, BUT YOU CAN REST ASSURED THAT WHAT HAPPENED WAS UNINTENTIONAL. SOME PEOPLE IGNORED THE ORDER TO STOP. THE PEOPLE SHOULD BE MORE ALERT AND AWARE OF THE SITUATION BECAUSE OF THE REBELS' ATTACKS.
TST2-MUC4-0057	CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- A. WE HEREBY VOICE OUR WILLINGNESS THAT THERE BE AN IMMEDIATE IN SITU CEASE-FIRE WITH INTERNATIONAL SUPERVISION AND AN OVERALL AND DEFINITIVE SIMULTANEOUS NEGOTIATION LEADING TO A NATIONAL CONSENSUS BASED ON DEMOCRATIZATION, DEMILITARIZATION OF SOCIETY, AND RESPECT FOR THE RIGHTS OF SALVADORANS. B. IN ORDER TO HOLD GOOD NEGOTIATIONS, WE FEEL IT IS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH IMMEDIATE GUARANTEES FOR THE RESPECT OF HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRATIC FREEDOMS, AND POLITICAL AND SOCIAL GROUPS THROUGH: 1. LIFTING OF THE STATE OF SIEGE AND REPEAL OF THE LAW ON REFO THE PENAL CODES, ALSO KNOWN AS THE ANTITERRORIST LAW THAT WAS RECENTLY APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY. 2. RELEASE OF ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS. 3. ALLOWED DEPARTURE OF FMLN WAR DISABLED AND MEDICAL TREATMEN FMLN WOUNDED. 4. IMMEDIATE DISMISSAL OF THE FOLLOWING COMMANDERS AND OFFICER COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINTS CHIEFS OF STAFF, FOR HIS RESPONSIBILITY IN DECISIONS MADE BY THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND TO CARRY OUT INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AND THE ASSASSINATION OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS; GENERAL RAFAEL BUSTILLOS, GENERAL RAFAEL ANTONIO VILLAMARIONA, AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL JUAN ANTONIO MARTINEZ VARELA, COMMANDER AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE AIR FORCE, FOR THEIR DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY IN THE BOMBINGS OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION; COLONEL ORLANDO ZEPEDA, DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTER, FOR HAVING SIGNED THE ORDER TO ASSASSINATE THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS; COLONEL HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ, DIRECTOR OF THE TREASURY POLICE, WHICH IS THE CORPS THAT CARRIED OUT THE MURDERS; AND CAPTAIN ALFONSO CHAVEZ GARCIA, WHO WAS THE DIRECT PERPETRATOR OF THESE MURDERS. ALL OF THESE DISMISSALS ARE NEEDED FOR THE CREDIBILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DECISION TO ESTABLISH GUARANTEES FOR THE RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND AS A FIRST STEP IN THE PURGE OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR THE DISMANTLING OF THE BLOODY MILITARY DICTATORSHIP OF THE PAST 60 YEARS. 5. THE IN SITU VERIFICATION OF THE RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS MUST BE CARRIED OUT BY THE INTER-AMERICAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION AND THE UN WORK TEAM ON THE FORCED DISAPPEARANCES. C. WE THINK IT IS INDISPENSABLE TO REORGANIZE THE NEGOTIATING TABLE TO ENSURE THAT OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES AND SOCIAL GROUPS ARE ABLE TO FULLY PARTICIPATE ALONG WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN. THIS WILL ASSURE A NATIONAL CONSENSUS SOLUTION. MESSRS PRESIDENTS: THE SCOPE OF WAR IN OUR COUNTRY DEMANDS REALISTIC VIEWPOINTS, VIABLE AND URGENT SOLUTIONS. YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE SO THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS WILL PREVAIL OVER WAR AND THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PROCESS WILL YIELD SPECIFIC RESULTS. WE REITERATE OUR APPRECIATION TO YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS, THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND, EL SALVADOR, 8 DECEMBER 1989.

TST2-MUC4-0059	BOGOTA, 25 SEP 89 -- THE POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT THREE TERRORIST ATTACKS HERE IN BOGOTA AND IN THE CARIBBEAN PORT OF CARTAGENA LEFT TWO DEAD AND THREE INJURED. THE MOST SERIOUS INCIDENT TOOK PLACE AT THE HISTORICAL BEACH RESORT WHERE A BOMB EXPLODED ON THE 6TH FLOOR OF THE HILTON HOTEL KILLING TWO PEOPLE AND SERIOUSLY INJURING ANOTHER. ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY ANOTHER BOMB EXPLODED IN FRONT OF A BANK IN ANOTHER PART OF CARTAGENA, PARTIALLY DESTROYING THE BUILDING AND INJURING A GUARD AND A PASSERBY. MEANWHILE, IN BOGOTA, A BOMB EXPLODED AT A BRANCH OF THE CITY'S ELECTRIC ENERGY ENTERPRISE IN THE SUBURB OF QUIRIGUA. THE COMPANY'S OFFICES WERE DESTROYED, AND APPROXIMATELY 50 NEIGHBORING RESIDENCES WERE DAMAGED BY THE BLAST. ACCORDING TO A GUARD AT THE COMPANY, WHO ESCAPED UNHURT, TWO INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE PASSING BY THE BUILDING PLACED THE EXPLOSIVES AND FLED. THE GUARD SAID HE BARELY HAD TIME TO GET AWAY FROM THE BOMB BEFORE IT WENT OFF. GUESTS AT THE HOTEL, WHERE PRACTICALLY ALL THE WINDOWS WERE DESTROYED, HAD TO BE EVACUATED TO OTHER LODGINGS. CARTAGENA HAD UP TO NOW ESCAPED THE WAVE OF DYNAMITE ATTACKS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE IN THE COUNTRY'S LARGE CITIES FOR THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS. AUTHORITIES ATTRIBUTE THE ATTACKS TO DRUG TRAFFICKERS.
TST2-MUC4-0060	SANTIAGO, 28 FEB 90 -- SOME 9,000 CARABINEROS MEMBERS WILL PARTICIPATE IN A SPECIAL POLICE PLAN BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER THE OFFICIAL TRANSFER OF POWER CEREMONIES IN OUR COUNTRY. THIS WAS REPORTED BY GENERAL ALFREDO NUNEZ ALLENDE, THE CARABINEROS ORDER AND SECURITY DIRECTOR, WHO ALSO DESCRIBED THE LATEST TERRORIST ATTACKS AS ISOLATED EVENTS WHICH ARE UNDER CONTROL. WE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SECURITY OF THE POPULATION AND OF THE FOREIGN GUESTS IN KEEPING WITH OUR DUTY REQUIREMENTS. AS FOR THE RECENT ATTACKS, I MUST SAY THEY ARE REGRETTABLE AND I WISH THEY HAD NOT TAKEN PLACE, HOWEVER, THIS KIND OF ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN ALL OUR PLANS. WE HAVE ADOPTED ALL THE MEASURES WE THINK ARE APPROPRIATE IN CASE THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY TAKES PLACE. WE WILL ALSO TRY TO PREVENT THIS KIND OF ACTION DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION SO THAT PEOPLE UNDER OUR PROTECTION WILL NOT BE AFFECTED. WHY HAS TERRORIST ACTIVITY INCREASED IN THE PAST FEW DAYS? I THINK THAT THIS IS NORMAL WITHIN THE CURRENT PROCESS, IT IS NOT A SPECIFIC FACTOR OR OBJECTIVE. THE ATTACKS ARE IN KEEPING WITH WHAT WE HAVE BEEN OBSERVING IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS. THE CARABINEROS ORDER AND SECURITY CHIEF ALSO REPORTED THAT REINFORCEMENTS WILL BE BROUGHT IN TO SANTIAGO FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, AND HE ADDED THAT THE DISSOLUTION OF THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER WILL NOT AFFECT THE NORMAL WORK OF THE CARABINEROS. HE ALSO SAID THAT IN FACE OF THE RECENT TERRORIST ATTACKS, THE APPROPRIATE MEASURES HAVE BEEN ADOPTED. AS FAR AS HE KNEW, HE SAID, THE ARMY WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN ESTABLISHING ORDER AND SECURITY DURING THE TRANSFER OF POWER CEREMONY; THIS WILL BE EXCLUSIVE RESPONSIBILITY OF CHILEAN CARABINEROS. AS FOR THE RECENT TERRORIST ATTACKS, HE SAID THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE PART OF A PLAN, ALTHOUGH HE ADMITTED THAT EXTREMIST ACTIVITY HAS INCREASED LATELY. HOWEVER, SUCH ACTIONS ARE WITHIN WHAT WAS EXPECTED. HE SAID THAT THE SECURITY PERSONNEL THAT WILL BE BROUGHT IN BY THE FOREIGN GUESTS HAVE ALREADY COORDINATED THEIR ACTIONS WITH THOSE OF CARABINEROS. ON 5 MARCH, THE CARABINEROS WILL ANNOUNCE A DETAILED REPORT ON THE TRANSFER OF POWER CEREMONY AND ON THE MEASURES THAT WILL BE ADOPTED, ESPECIALLY REGARDING THE CIRCULATION OF CARS. THE SECURITY PLAN WILL BE SIMILAR TO THE ONE USED DURING POPE JOHN PAUL II'S VISIT TO CHILE.

BRUGUES THUS ANSWERED THE REMARKS MADE BY ASPILLAGA, WHO SAID THAT, IN 1976, CUBAN PRIME MINISTER FIDEL CASTRO ORDERED THE KILLING OF BOLIVIAN GENERAL JOAQUIN ZENTENO ANAYA. IN A STATEMENT RELEASED YESTERDAY AFTERNOON, THE CUBAN AMBASSADOR REGRETTED THAT THE UNITED STATES IS PROVIDING SHELTER FOR THIS KIND OF PERSON AND USING THEM AS "PARROTS TO SMEAR THE CUBA REVOLUTION." THE NEWS AGENCY PRENSA LATINA ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE IN A JOURNALISTIC DISPATCH. IT REPORTS THAT AMBASSADOR BRUGUES HAD POINTED OUT THAT "THE U.S. PHILOSOPHERS AND THEORETICIANS WHO TRIED TO THROW SOCIALISM INTO THE GARBAGE CAN OF HISTORY HAVE LAUNCHED A NEW ATTACK AGAINST CUBA." THE CUBAN AMBASSADOR ADDED: "THEY INTEND TO BRING INTERNATIONAL DISCREDIT UPON CUBA AND POISON CUBA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FRATERNAL BOLIVIAN NATION, A RELATIONSHIP MARKED BY FRIENDSHIP AND MUTUAL RESPECT. TO THIS EFFECT, THEY AGAIN RESORT TO USING HYPOCRITS LIKE THE DESERTER IN QUESTION." BRUGUES ADDED: "ON PRINCIPLE, CUBA HAS NOT RESORTED, AND WILL NOT RESORT, TO TERRORIST METHODS LIKE THOSE USED BY THE UNITED STATES AGAINST CUBAN LEADERS, AS STATED IN THE RECORDS OF THE U.S. CONGRESS." HE ADDED: "WE REITERATE TO GEN ZENTENO ANAYA'S WIDOW AND CHILDREN, AND TO THE BOLIVIAN MILITARY MEN WHO, COMPLYING WITH THEIR MISSION, CONFRONTED "CHE" , THAT CUBA DOES NOT HARBOR ANY RANCOUR OR HATRED. CUBA HAS NEVER ACTED, AND WILL NEVER ACT, MOTIVATED BY BASE REVENGEFUL FEELINGS." IN CONCLUSION, AMBASSADOR BRUGUES EXPRESSED HIS CONVICTION THAT THE BOLIVIAN-CUBAN TIES WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY THIS SMEAR CAMPAIGN.
TST2-MUC4-0067	SAN SALVADOR, 12 MAR 89 -- SALVADORAN PRESIDENT JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE TONIGHT CALLED FOR SPAIN, MEXICO, VENEZUELA, AND NICARAGUA TO MEDIATE WITH THE SALVADORAN REBELS SO THEY WILL NOT BOYCOTT THE 19 MARCH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. "THERE CAN BE NO PEACE WITHOUT DEMOCRACY, AND VOTING IS THE PATH TO DEMOCRACY," DUARTE SAID IN A SPEECH TRANSMITTED BY A NATIONWIDE RADIO NETWORK. IN THIS SPEECH, HE URGED THE GUERRILLAS TO LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND JOIN THE SALVADORAN POLITICAL PROCESS. DUARTE ISSUED THIS CALL TO THE GOVERNMENTS OF THESE FOUR COUNTRIES AND TO POPE JOHN PAUL II TO INTERCEDE WITH THE FMLN IN SUPPORT OF THE ELECTIONS. IN THE PAST FEW DAYS, THE REBELS HAVE CALLED FOR A TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE TO BEGIN ON 16 MARCH, HAVE ORDERED GAS STATION OWNERS TO REFRAIN FROM SELLING FUEL, HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL DESTROY POWER LINES, AND THREATENED TO KILL ELECTION OFFICIALS. ON SUNDAY, 19 MARCH, 1.8 MILLION SALVADORANS WILL CAST THEIR VOTE TO ELECT THE MAN WHO WILL REPLACE DUARTE. THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT CALLED ON THE PEOPLE TO VOTE AND SAID THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMY "WILL GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF THE ELECTIONS." FOLLOWING THE FAILURE OF THE NEGOTIATIONS, DURING WHICH THE REBELS PROPOSED THE POSTPONEMENT OF THE ELECTIONS AND THE CREATION OF "A NEW ELECTORAL FRAMEWORK," THE FMLN HAS ASKED THE PEOPLE NOT TO VOTE OR TO "VOID" THEIR BALLOTS.
TST2-MUC4-0068	GUATEMALA CITY, 19 AUG 89 -- FIRE DEPARTMENT SOURCES REPORTED TODAY THAT GUATEMALAN ARMY TROOPS KILLED NINE PEASANTS BY MISTAKE ON 17 AUGUST. THE SOLDIERS MISTOOK THE PEASANTS, WHO WERE CIVIL SELF-DEFENSE PATROL MEMBERS, WITH A REBEL COLUMN. ACCORDING TO THE SAME SOURCE, MILITARY OFFICIALS HAVE STATED THAT THE INCIDENT, WHERE THREE PEASANTS WERE ALSO WOUNDED, HAD BEEN A "TRAGIC MISTAKE." THE INCIDENT TOOK PLACE WHEN NORTHEASTERN COBAN BASE TROOPS MISTOOK THE CIVILIAN PATROL FOR A REBEL COLUMN AND ATTACKED IT. THE ATTACK RESULTED IN 9 INDIAN PEASANTS KILLED AND 3 WOUNDED, INCLUDING A 17-YEAR-OLD. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE COBAN FIRE DEPARTMENT, THE INCIDENT TOOK PLACE WHEN A PAC PATROL WAS COMBING THE AREA FOR A REBEL COLUMN THAT HAD BEEN SEEN IN "LA PROVIDENCIA" FARMING COMMUNITY AREA. THE CIVILIAN PATROL WAS RETURNING TO ITS COMMUNITY ON 17 AUGUST, WHEN THE ARMY TROOPS, WHO WERE ALSO SEARCHING FOR THE REBEL COLUMN, FIRED AT THEM BELIEVING THEY WERE PART OF A REBEL GROUP. THE CIVILIAN PATROL UNIT, APPROXIMATELY 70 PERSONS, DID NOT FIRE BACK AT THE SOLDIERS. ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BY ONE OF THE SURVIVORS, THE CIVILIANS SHOUTED AND MADE SIGNS TO THE TROOPS UNTIL, FINALLY, THE SOLDIERS REALIZED THEIR ERROR. THE SOLDIERS, HOWEVER, REALIZED THEIR MISTAKE ONLY AFTER NINE CIVILIANS HAD BEEN KILLED. GUATEMALAN DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL HECTOR ALEJANDRO GRAMAJO WAS QUERIED ABOUT THE INCIDENT. HE SAID IT WAS CAUSED BY "REGRETTABLE CONFUSION" AND THAT AN ARMY COMMAND STAFF COMMISSION HAD ALREADY BEEN SENT TO INVESTIGATE IT. GRAMAJO SAID THE COMMISSION IS TO ESTABLISH HOW THE INCIDENT OCCURRED, BUT ADMITTED THAT INITIAL REPORTS INDICATE THAT THERE HAD BEEN CONFUSION BETWEEN ARMY AND PAC UNITS. THE MILITARY CHIEF SAID: "THE INFORMATION WE HAVE UP TO NOW IS CONFUSING AS BOTH THE ARMY AND PAC HAD MOVED MEN BECAUSE THERE WERE REPORTS THAT A REBEL UNIT WAS IN THE AREA."
TST2-MUC4-0069	BOGOTA, 7 SEP 89 -- MEDELLIN CONTINUES TO LIVE THROUGH A WAVE OF TERROR. FOLLOWING LAST NIGHT'S ATTACK ON A BANK, WHICH CAUSED A LOT OF DAMAGE, A LOAD OF DYNAMITE WAS HURLED AGAINST A POLICE STATION. FORTUNATELY NO ONE WAS HURT. HOWEVER, AT APPROXIMATELY 1700 TODAY A BOMB EXPLODED INSIDE A FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT. A MEDIUM-SIZED BOMB EXPLODED SHORTLY BEFORE 1700 AT THE PRESTO INSTALLATIONS LOCATED ON AND PLAYA AVENUE. APPROXIMATELY 35 PEOPLE WERE INSIDE THE RESTAURANT AT THE TIME. A WORKER NOTICED A SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE UNDER A TABLE WHERE MINUTES BEFORE TWO MEN HAD BEEN SEATED. AFTER AN INITIAL MINOR EXPLOSION, THE PACKAGE EXPLODED. THE 35 PEOPLE HAD ALREADY BEEN EVACUATED FROM THE BUILDING, AND ONLY 1 POLICEMAN WAS SLIGHTLY INJURED; HE WAS THROWN TO THE GROUND BY THE SHOCK WAVE. THE AREA WAS IMMEDIATELY CORDONED OFF BY AUTHORITIES WHILE THE OTHER BUSINESSES CLOSED THEIR DOORS. IT IS NOT KNOWN HOW MUCH DAMAGE WAS CAUSED; HOWEVER, MOST OF THE DAMAGE WAS OCCURRED INSIDE THE RESTAURANT. THE MEN WHO LEFT THE BOMB FLED AND THERE ARE NO CLUES AS TO THEIR WHEREABOUTS.
TST2-MUC4-0070	SAN SALVADOR, 5 OCT 89 -- TODAY, RELIEF ORGANIZATIONS EVACUATED DOZENS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE LOCKED INSIDE "LA CENTROAMERICANA" BUILDING IN SAN SALVADOR WHERE THE COSTA RICAN EMBASSY IS LOCATED. HOWEVER, THE EMBASSY CONTINUES TO BE OCCUPIED BY APPROXIMATELY 50 DEMONSTRATORS. AMBASSADOR JESUS FERNANDEZ AND ANOTHER TWO DIPLOMATS, AS WELL AS THREE SALVADORAN TELEVISION JOURNALISTS, ARE STILL BEING HELD HOSTAGE. APPROXIMATELY 50 PEOPLE LEFT THE BUILDING IN WHICH THEY WERE LOCKED FOR 5 HOURS FOLLOWING THE OCCUPATION OF THE EMBASSY BY MEMBERS AND SYMPATHIZERS OF THE MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO FEDERATION OF COMMITTEES OF MOTHERS AND RELATIVES OF POLITICAL PRISONERS AND MURDERED AND MISSING PEOPLE. THE AMBASSADOR AND OTHER EMBASSY OFFICIALS STILL REMAIN ON THE THIRD FLOOR OF THE BUILDING, WHICH WAS SURROUNDED BY DOZENS OF RIOT POLICEMEN EXPERT IN ANTITERRORIST STRUGGLE, ARMED WITH HIGH-CALIBER RIFLES. RED CROSS, GREEN CROSS, AND RELIEF COMMAND MEMBERS PARTICIPATED IN THE EVACUATION OF THE OFFICES IN THE BUILDING. COLONEL ALEJANDRO SANCHEZ, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE SALVADORAN NATIONAL POLICE, SAID THAT "THE PROBLEM COULD BE SOLVED WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS, BUT OFFICIAL SOURCES RULED OUT THE USE OF FORCE. MAURICIO SANDOVAL, DIRECTOR OF THE PRESIDENCY'S COMMUNICATIONS SECRETARIAT, WENT TO "LA CENTROAMERICANA" BUILDING, LOCATED IN EL SALVADOR'S BUSINESS DISTRICT, TO LEARN ABOUT THE SITUATION AND DESCRIBED THE OCCUPATION AS A "PROPAGANDA ACT" IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE SECOND ROUND OF TALKS BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS, SCHEDULED FOR 16 AND 17 OCTOBER IN SAN JOSE , IS DRAWING CLOSER. THE FECMAFAM OCCUPIED THE COSTA RICAN EMBASSY TO PROTEST "AN INCREASE IN REPRESSION AGAINST POPULAR ORGANIZATIONS UNLEASHED BY ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S FASCIST GOVERNMENT," FECMAFAM SPOKESMEN SAID. MOST OF THOSE OCCUPYING THE EMBASSY ARE WOMEN WEARING WHITE SCARFS AND YOUTHS CARRYING WET HANDKERCHIEFS TO AVOID THE EFFECTS OF TEAR GAS. SANDOVAL DISCLOSED THAT A WORKING COMMISSION HAS BEEN FORMED TO MAINTAIN CONSULTATIONS WITH THE COSTA RICAN GOVERNMENT "AND IS MAKING PERTINENT CONTACTS" TO SEEK A QUICK SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. THE OFFICIAL STRESSED: "WE WILL NOT BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS" WITH THE EMBASSY OCCUPIERS, WHOM, ACCORDING TO THE AMBASSADOR, ARE ARMED. THE PRESIDENTIAL SPOKESMAN ALSO REPORTED THAT, IN THE WAKE OF THESE INCIDENTS, FERNANDEZ HAD A SLIGHT CARDIAC PROBLEM, BUT HAS ALREADY GOTTEN OVER IT. ACCORDING TO THIS OFFICIAL, FERNANDEZ' WIFE SENT HIM MEDICINE AND FOOD. SANDOVAL ANNOUNCED THAT AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE WILL BE ISSUED WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS.
TST2-MUC4-0071	TEGUCIGALPA, 18 NOV 89 -- HONDURAN PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA HOYO TODAY SAID THAT THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR HAS REACHED "ABOMINABLE AND HORRENDOUS" EXTREMES. THE PRESIDENT CITED THE KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS IN SAN SALVADOR ON 16 NOVEMBER AS PROOF OF "THE INCREDIBLE LEVELS OF VIOLENCE REACHED IN THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRY." AZCONA SAID THAT HE IS BEING KEPT INFORMED ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENTS IN EL SALVADOR, EVEN SPEAKING WITH HIS COUNTERPART, ALFREDO CRISTIANI, BUT DID NOT VOLUNTEER ANY DETAILS ABOUT THE MATTERS DISCUSSED. VARIOUS HONDURAN POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE EXPRESSED VIEWS SIMILAR TO THOSE VOICED BY THE PRESIDENT OF HONDURAS, A COUNTRY THAT SHARES A 417-KM BORDER WITH EL SALVADOR. IN A STATEMENT RELEASED TODAY, THE HONDURAN EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE "DEPLORED THE SAD INCIDENTS THAT RESULTED IN THE COLD-BLOODED MURDER OF SIX JESUITS." THE HONDURAN BISHOPS STRESSED THAT "THE FRATRICIDAL STRUGGLE IS A BITTER RESULT OF THE INJUSTICE THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SUFFERING." IN SIMILAR TERMS, THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC INNOVATION AND UNITY PARTY, AGREED THAT VIOLENCE IN EL SALVADOR FINDS ITS ROOTS IN THOSE WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND ACTIONS IN FAVOR OF THE OPPRESSED AND THE PEOPLE'S TRUE LIBERATION. THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE SALVADORAN MILITARY SITUATION, AND THEY ALSO CONDEMNED THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT . RANKING OFFICERS, INCLUDING NEW MILITARY COMMANDER COLONEL ARNULFO CANTARERO, MAINTAINED THAT EL SALVADOR IS A VICTIM OF "COMMUNIST AGGRESSION." HOWEVER, THE MILITARY OFFICERS SAY THAT THEY WILL REMAIN OUTSIDE THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT, WHICH INCREASED WHEN THE INSURGENTS BEGAN A GENERAL OFFENSIVE A WEEK AGO.
TST2-MUC4-0072	LIMA, NO DATE -- I BELIEVE THAT THE CLIMATE OF FLEXIBILITY IS EMBRACING THE ENTIRE POLITICAL, MILITARY, AND ECONOMIC WORLD SYSTEM AND THAT THE BANKS WILL HAVE TO BE CONTENT WITH COLLECTING LESS THAN WHAT THEY ORIGINALLY THOUGHT. THERE WAS A TRIUMPHANT PRESENTATION OF AN OFFER TO REDUCE A COUNTRY'S DEBT BY UP TO 20 PERCENT, BUT AS FAR AS WE KNOW THAT OFFER HAS NOT MATERIALIZED. FURTHERMORE, A 20-PERCENT REDUCTION IS NOT SIGNIFICANT, NOT GREAT ENOUGH TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF POVERTY AND THE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS OF LATIN AMERICA. THE REDUCTION MUST BE MUCH GREATER. A REDUCTION OF 10 OR 20 PERCENT WILL DO LITTLE; EVERYTHING WILL REMAIN THE SAME. WE BELIEVE -- AND I HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS TO EVERY LATIN AMERICAN PRESIDENT -- THAT ONLY THROUGH OUR ADOPTION OF FIRM AND DIGNIFIED POSITIONS WILL THE ADVERSARY RELENT. LET ME NOW SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT A DIFFERENT SUBJECT, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA. I BELIEVE THE OPPOSITION HAS RAISED A TEMPEST IN A TEACUP; IT HAS RAISED AN ISSUE THAT IS OF NO RELEVANCE TO THE PERUVIAN PEOPLE. FIRST, WE UPHOLD THE CONCEPT OF UNIVERSALITY OF RELATIONS, OF MAINTAINING RELATIONS WITH ALL NATIONS. COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO ESTABLISHED RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA A FEW MONTHS AGO; HE DID NOT HAVE TO FACE A SAVAGE OPPOSITION TELLING HIM THAT HE WAS THROWING HIMSELF INTO THE ARMS OF TERRORISM. NOBODY HAS COMPLAINED TO CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ OR TO SALINAS DE GORTARI ABOUT MAINTAINING RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA. FOR THAT MATTER, NOBODY HAS OBJECTED IN BOLIVIA, AUSTRIA, OR SWEDEN, BECAUSE IN THOSE COUNTRIES THERE IS NO REACTIONARY RIGHT TO ARGUE THAT TO RECOGNIZE NORTH KOREA IS TO COURT DESTRUCTION. SECOND, SOMEONE -- AND I DO NOT WANT TO MENTION HIM BY NAME -- HAS SAID THAT RELATIONS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED WITH A TERRORIST STATE. THIS IS A TREMENDOUS ERROR, BECAUSE 20,000 RIFLES SOLD TO US BY NORTH KOREA AT $90 APIECE -- $10 LESS THAN ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD -- HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE TO SAVE AND DEFEND THE LIVES OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CIVILIAN GUARDS FROM THE NATIONAL POLICE AND HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE TO ELIMINATE AND ERADICATE SUBVERSION IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. THIRD, INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS ARE NOT DESIGNED TO BE AUCTIONED OFF TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER. IF SO WE WOULD HAVE TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH AUSTRALIA OR WITH FINLAND. ONE MUST MAINTAIN RELATIONS WITH ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD. UNDER SUCH CRITERIA, SINCE PERU RECOGNIZES THE FRG, IT SHOULD CLOSE ITS EMBASSY IN THE COMMUNIST GDR. THIS MANICHEAN CRITERION, THIS OBTUSE CRITERION, THIS OUTMODED CRITERION IS NO LONGER VALID; THE BERLIN WALL HAS BEEN RAZED. HOW CAN ONE SAY THAT THIS COUNTRY SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AND ANOTHER SHOULDN'T? PERU WILL NOT ACCEPT ANY IMPERIALIST VETO ON ITS WORLD RELATIONS. WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THE 1960'S AND 1970'S WHEN PASSPORTS SAID WE COULD NOT TRAVEL TO THE SOVIET UNION OR CUBA. PERUVIANS HAVE THE RIGHT TO TRAVEL WHEREVER THEY WISH, LIKE THEY WISH, AND WHEN THEY WISH. THIS IS FREEDOM, AND IT CANNOT BE CURTAILED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OFF-LIMITS AREAS AROUND THE GLOBE. FINALLY, SEVERAL OF THE GENTLEMEN WHO NOW OPPOSE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA HAVE BEEN HONORED, ILLUSTRIOUS GUESTS OF THE NORTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT. THE OTHER DAY I HEARD SOME PEOPLE SPEAKING VEHEMENTLY ON THIS TOPIC, WHILE SOME OTHER PEOPLE NEARBY HAD BEEN HONORED GUESTS THERE. JOURNALISTS CAN SEEK OUT AND DETERMINE HOW MANY OF THOSE WHO NOW OPPOSE THESE RELATIONS HAVE BEEN HONORED GUESTS IN NORTH KOREA FOR WEEKS. NOW, FOR POLITICAL REASONS, THEY ARE OPPOSED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA.
TST2-MUC4-0073	SAN SALVADOR, 14 JAN 90 -- MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, SAID TODAY THAT PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S MESSAGE REVEALING THE NAMES OF THE PERSONS REPORTEDLY INVOLVED IN THE SIX JESUITS' SLAYING REPRESENTS "A DECISIVE TURN TOWARD THE END OF IMPUNITY" IN THE COUNTRY. ROSA CHAVEZ SAID IN HIS SUNDAY HOMILY THAT "THIS HAS AUGMENTED THE POSSIBILITIES FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO RECOVER THEIR TRUST IN THE GOVERNMENT'S INSTITUTIONS." NEVERTHELESS, IN A STATEMENT GIVEN LATER TO THE MEDIA, THE AUXILIARY BISHOP EMPHASIZED THAT THE IMPLICATED MILITARY "DO NOT REPRESENT ISOLATED CASES OF PERSONS WHO VIOLATED THE NORMS OF AN INSTITUTION, BUT ARE ACTUALLY PART OF A FORMATION AND THOUGHT SCHEME ACCORDING TO WHICH THE DEFENSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS SOMETHING SUBVERSIVE." ACCORDING TO ROSA CHAVEZ, "THE MILITARY WORLD WRONGLY UNDERSTANDS THE CHURCH'S MISSION IN THE DEFENSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS." "ASKED ABOUT EVENTUAL RESPONSIBILITIES NOT SPECIFIED BY THE PRESIDENT, ROSA CHAVEZ ANSWERED: "THIS GRAVE ACTION IS THE RESULT OF A CONSPIRACY--AT LEAST A CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE." HE EMPHASIZED THAT, CONSEQUENTLY, THE STEP TAKEN YESTERDAY BY THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT "IS VERY IMPORTANT, EVEN IF IT IS NOT THE LAST ONE." THE BISHOP RECALLED THAT THIS YEAR IS THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO'S ASSASSINATION, "WHICH HAS YET TO BE SOLVED," AND ASKED THE GOVERNMENT TO CARRY OUT "ALL THE LEGAL ACTIONS TO INVESTIGATE THE CASES OF THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS WHOSE LIVES WERE TAKEN BY GUERRILLA GROUPS OR THE ARMY." ROSA CHAVEZ SAID THAT THE CHURCH FULLY AGREES THAT THE CRIMES OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED "WITH THE SAME ZEAL" WITH WHICH THE JESUIT PRIESTS' SLAYING HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED. "HOWEVER, WE HAVE ASKED THAT THE INVESTIGATION BE EXHAUSTIVELY AND THOROUGHLY CARRIED OUT WITHOUT GIVING IT A PROPAGANDISTIC APPEARANCE," HE ADDED. THE BISHOP EMPHASIZED THAT THE TWO IDEOLOGIES CONFRONTING EACH OTHER IN EL SALVADOR EQUALLY DISDAIN HUMAN RIGHTS. "MARXISM IS THE ROOT OF THE FMLN'S ABUSE AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY DOCTRINE REPRESENTS THE BASIS OF THE ARMED FORCES' UNACCEPTABLE REPRESSION," HE SAID.
TST2-MUC4-0074	CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- THE MAIN REASON FOR COMING UP WITH THIS VERSION WAS TO MASTERMINDS OF THE CRIME TO FIND OUT WHO THE PERPETRATORS WERE. WITH THIS VERSION, CRISTIANI AND THE HIGH COMMAND ARE TRYING TO COME UP WITH EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THE TRIAL AND TO PLACE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUITS ON MID-LEVEL MILITARY OFFICERS. THE COLONELS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE CRIME COULD BE SET FREE AND THEIR RESPONSIBILITY WOULD ONLY BE RELATED TO THE FACT THAT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED WITHIN AN AREA UNDER THEIR COMMAND. THIS VERSION OF THE CRIME IS AIMED AT LEAVING THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND FREE FROM ANY RESPONSIBILITY AND TO ONLY SLIGHTLY TOUCH THE MEMBERS OF LA TANDONA, ESPECIALLY COL ORLANDO CEPEDA, WHO WAS THE ONE WHO SIGNED THE ORDER TO ASSASSINATE THE JESUITS, AND COL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHIEF OF STAFF. COL GUILLERMO BENAVIDES, WHO IS A MEMBER OF LITTLE IMPORTANCE WITHIN LA TANDONA, WAS INDIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE CRIME. HOWEVER, THE IS SELF-EVIDENT. THE DECISION TO CARRY OUT AN OPERATION TO KILL POPULAR AND RELIGIOUS DEMOCRATIC LEADERS WAS MADE BY THE GENERAL STAFF OF THE ARMED FORCES 4 DAYS AFTER THE FMLN OFFENSIVE BEGAN. THIS OPERATION WAS PART OF A COMPLETE COUNTEROFFENSIVE PLAN OF THE ARMED FORCES, WHICH INCLUDED THE MASSIVE USE OF ALL THE FIREPOWER OF THE AIR FORCE AGAINST POOR NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE KILLING OF DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT AND CHURCH LEADERS. ALFREDO CRISTIANI, WHO WAS TAKEN TO THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE GENERAL STAFF FOR SECURITY REASONS AND ASSUMED CONTROL OF THE DEFENSE PLAN, WAS FULLY AWARE OF THE GENOCIDE PLAN. U.S. OFFICERS AND ADVISERS WERE ALSO AT THE GENERAL STAFF HEADQUARTERS AT THE TIME TO DISCUSS AND APPROVE THIS GENOCIDE PLAN. THE PLAN WAS IMPLEMENTED ON THE EVENING OF 16 NOVEMBER. ALL LABOR UNION OFFICES IN SAN SALVADOR WERE LOOTED. THE OFFICES OF HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS, POLITICAL PARTIES, AND RELIGIOUS CENTERS WERE ALSO LOOTED. THE PLAN WAS IMPLEMENTED AT THE INSTALLATIONS OF THE UCA. THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED SAW A CONTINUATION OF THE ARRESTS, PERSECUTIONS, AND ASSASSINATIONS. THE OFFICES OF ALL THE WERE ATTACKED. ITS LEADERS WERE FORCED TO SEEK REFUGE OR TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY TO ESCAPE THIS MANHUNT. THIS IS A POLICY FOR WHICH THE HIGH COMMAND AND ALFREDO CRISTIANI ARE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE. THE U.S. AMBASSADOR AND U.S. EMBASSY PERSONNEL ARE FULLY AWARE OF THIS. THE NEED TO COME UP WITH THIS VERSION COMES FROM THE PRECARIOUS PREDICAMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES IN IN VIEW OF THE DEBATES TAKING PLACE IN THE U.S. CONGRESS TO DECIDE THE FATE OF AID TO EL SALVADOR, WHICH IS LINKED TO THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION OF THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS ON 16 NOVEMBER.
TST2-MUC4-0075	SAN SALVADOR, 31 OCT 89 -- AT LEAST SIX PERSONS WERE KILLED AND SEVERAL INJURED WHEN A CAR BOMB EXPLODED TODAY OUTSIDE THE OFFICES OF THE SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION IN THE HEART OF SAN SALVADOR, THE POLICE REPORTED. THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED AT 1230 AND CAUSED PANIC AND CONFUSION. FENASTRAS BELONGS TO THE NATIONAL UNION OF SALVADORAN WORKERS , THE LARGEST NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OPPOSED TO THE GOVERNMENT.
TST2-MUC4-0076	BOGOTA, 3 SEP 89 -- OFFICIAL SOURCES ANNOUNCED THAT A U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT HERCULES C-123 CARGO PLANE WAS PARTIALLY DESTROYED EARLY THIS MORNING WHEN AN INCENDIARY BOMB EXPLODED AT THE MONTERIA AIRPORT. MONTERIA IS THE CAPITAL OF CORDOBA DEPARTMENT AND IT IS LOCATED 490 KM NORTH OF BOGOTA. A SPOKESMAN FOR THE MONTERIA POLICE ADVISED AFP VIA TELEPHONE THAT THE FRONT PART OF THE PLANE, AS WELL AS THE COCKPIT, WERE BURNED WHEN A BOMB, PLANTED BY UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS, EXPLODED. NO VICTIMS WERE REPORTED. THE U.S. EMBASSY IN BOGOTA CONFIRMED THAT THE PLANE WAS "SERIOUSLY DAMAGED" BY THE FLAMES; HOWEVER, THE EMBASSY DID NOT SPECIFY THE ORIGIN OF THE FIRE. ACCORDING TO EMBASSY SPOKESMAN PETER SAMSON, THE PLANE IS THE PROPERTY OF THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT'S INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS MATTERS . THE PLANE, WHICH WAS RETURNING TO THE UNITED STATES AFTER FULFILLING A MISSION IN PERU, HAD BEEN PARKED AT THE MONTERIA AIRPORT FOR THE PAST 2 WEEKS. THE PLANE WAS FORCED TO LAND IN MONTERIA AFTER ONE OF ITS ENGINES FAILED, THE EMBASSY SPOKESMAN ADDED. ACCORDING TO THE MONTERIA POLICE, THE FIRE BROKE OUT AFTER AN EXPLOSION WAS HEARD. THE FIREMEN INTERVENED QUICKLY TO PREVENT THE FIRE FROM SPREADING AND COMPLETELY DESTROYING THE PLANE. THE FIRE BROKE OUT AT 0430 , A FEW HOURS BEFORE TWO C-130 PLANES--U.S. MILITARY CARGO PLANES--ARRIVED AT BOGOTA AIR FORCE BASE WITH MILITARY MATERIEL SENT TO HELP FIGHT THE BATTLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING LAUNCHED BY THE COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES.
TST2-MUC4-0077	LIMA, 1 FEB 89 -- IN A COMMUNIQUE ADDRESSED TO THE LOCAL MEDIA, THE PERUVIAN GUERRILLA MOVEMENT TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT TODAY CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE KIDNAPPING OF 102 PEOPLE. AMONG THE MANY BUSINESSMEN WHO HAVE BEEN KIDNAPED FROM DIFFERENT INDUSTRIAL AND BUSINESS SECTORS IS CARLOS ENRIQUE FERREYROS, ALIAS "THE KIND OF THE MACHINERY INDUSTRY." FERREYROS WAS KIDNAPED ON 2 DECEMBER. THE MRTA IS ASKING $10 MILLION RANSOM FOR FERREYROS' RELEASE. THIS IS THE LARGEST RANSOM THE MRTA HAS EVER REQUESTED.

OUR FORCES ARE FINDING LITTLE RESISTANCE FROM THE SO-CALLED TROOPS BROUGHT FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY. THE REPORT STATES THAT DURING TODAY'S CLASHES IN CIUDAD DELGADO, LOS ALPES, GUADALUPE, AND SAN PATRICIO NEIGHBORHOODS, THE TREASURY POLICE SUFFERED THREE CASUALTIES. WE INFLICTED TWO CASUALTIES ON THE TREASURY POLICE IN LOS ALPES NEIGHBORHOOD, AND THE 6TH MILITARY DETACHMENT SUFFERED ONE CASUALTY DURING A CLASH IN SAN PATRICIO NEIGHBORHOOD. IT HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED THAT FMLN FORCES HAVE SET UP BARRICADES ON THE NORTHERN TRUNK ROAD AND POWER LINES HAVE BEEN SABOTAGED. AS A RESULT OF THIS SABOTAGE, AN AREA OF SAN SALVADOR DOES NOT HAVE POWER. WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT TWO TRANSFORMERS WERE DESTROYED ON KM 10 OF THE NORTHERN TRUNK ROAD, WHERE BARRICADES WERE ALSO SET UP.

IT IS NOW 1615 AND THE HIGH COMMAND HAS NOT REACTED. THIS GIVES US AN IDEA OF HOW LOW MORALE IS AMONG THE SOLDIERS IN SAN SALVADOR. THIS NEW BLOW AGAINST THE ENEMY FORCES IN SAN SALVADOR HAS CAUSED THE MORALE OF THE ENEMY FORCES TO DROP EVEN FURTHER. ATTENTION: WE HAVE JUST LEARNED THAT THERE HAS BEEN A REBEL AMBUSH IN THE NORTHERN SECTOR OF SAN SALVADOR. THE REPORT ADDS THAT AT 0630 TODAY, REBEL FORCES AMBUSHED A VEHICLE TRANSPORTING NATIONAL GUARDSMEN. THE AMBUSH OCCURRED ON KM 9.5 ON THE NORTHERN TRUNK ROAD.

TST2-MUC4-0082	CARACAS , 18 MAY 90 -- GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO HAS PRESENTED TO THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT A PROPOSAL TO RESTRUCTURE THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT. THE PROPOSAL COVERS THE SUPPLY OF OIL AND THE SALE OF FINISHED PRODUCTS. ANOTHER POINT INCLUDED IS THE REFINANCING OF THE GUATEMALAN DEBT WITH VENEZUELA, WHICH TOTALS $200 MILLION. THE GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT'S ACTIVITIES BEGAN TODAY AT MIRAFLORES PALACE WHEN, PRIOR TO THE SIGNING OF THE TWO AGREEMENTS, THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT HELD A PRIVATE MEETING WITH HIS GUATEMALAN COUNTERPART. THE PRESIDENTS THEN HELD A FORMAL WORK SESSION WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF TWO COMMISSIONS AT THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL. GUATEMALA, LIKE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT BENEFIT FROM THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT, ARE FACING THE PROBLEM OF NOT BEING ABLE TO HONOR ALL COMMITMENTS ON DEBTS AS THEY MATURE. THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT WAS ONE OF THE POINTS DISCUSSED BY PRESIDENT CEREZO DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE TODAY AT THE AYACUCHO ROOM OF THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE. WE HAVE PROPOSED A 20-YEAR TERM TO RESTRUCTURE THE DEBT, WITH A SIX-YEAR GRACE PERIOD, AT FOUR PERCENT INTEREST. OBVIOUSLY, THIS HAS NOT BEEN THE USUAL PROCEDURE AT THE VENEZUELAN INVESTMENT FUND NOR IS THIS INCLUDED IN THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT. FOR THESE REASONS, BECAUSE THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT FIT VENEZUELAN LAW, WE NEED TO DISCUSS AND ADJUST THE TERMS TO THE LAW AND THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT. HOWEVER, THERE IS WILLINGNESS TO DISCUSS THE TERMS. WE WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO MAKE THE SAME PROPOSAL TO THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT, FROM WHOM WE EXPECT THE SAME ATTITUDE AND UNDERSTANDING, AND WE ARE CERTAIN WE WILL HAVE IT. WITHIN THE FORMAL CEREZO VISIT, TWO IMPORTANT AGREEMENTS BETWEEN VENEZUELA AND GUATEMALA WERE SIGNED TODAY. ONE OF THEM IS A COOPERATION AND FRIENDSHIP AGREEMENT. ANOTHER IS A SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL COOPERATION AGREEMENT IN ENERGY AND MINING MATTERS, WHICH WILL STRENGTHEN BILATERAL RELATIONS. AS ENERGY AND MINES MINISTER CELESTINO ARMAS SAID UPON SIGNING THE AGREEMENTS, THIS WILL PERMIT CARRYING OUT JOINT OIL EXPLORATION OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE AREA OF OIL EXPLORATION, THERE ARE VERY INTERESTING PROSPECTS IN GUATEMALA THAT COULD RESULT IN GREAT INTEREST FOR GUATEMALA AND FOR VENEZUELA. WITH REGARD TO MINING, WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THE POSSIBILITY OF MAKING SOME PROGRESS IN THE MINING SECTOR IN GUATEMALA AND THE POSSIBILITY OF HELPING GUATEMALA DISCOVER MINERAL DEPOSITS THAT COULD BE VERY ATTRACTIVE FOR OUR ECONOMIES. FOLLOWING THE NEWS CONFERENCE HELD AT THE MIRAFLORES PALACE, GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO WENT TO THE CELA . THE CEREZO AGENDA INCLUDED A DINNER HE WILL HOST TONIGHT FOR HIS COUNTERPART CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ.
TST2-MUC4-0083	BOGOTA, 20 AUG 89 -- A NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER AND SEVEN POLICEMEN WERE KILLED TODAY IN SOUTHERN COLOMBIA WHEN GUERRILLAS DYNAMITED THE VEHICLE IN WHICH THEY WERE TRAVELLING, HUILA DEPARTMENT AUTHORITIES HAVE REPORTED. THE SOURCES ATTRIBUTED THE ATTACK TO MEMBERS OF THE 17TH FRONT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA WHICH OPERATES IN THAT REGION, ABOUT 250 KM FROM BOGOTA. AFTER AMBUSHING THE PATROL ON A HIGHWAY LEADING TO SAN ANTONIO BAJO, THE REBELS STOLE THE POLICEMEN'S WEAPONS, WHICH CONSISTED OF 8 RIFLES, 2 GUNS, 1 GRENADE, AND 1,600 CARTRIDGES. COMBINED ARMY AND POLICE TROOPS, SUPPORTED BY HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS, IMMEDIATELY BEGAN THE PURSUIT OF THE REBELS WHO FLED TOWARD THE EASTERN MOUNTAIN REGION.
TST2-MUC4-0084	BEIJING , 16 FEB 90 -- AT THE END OF 1989 AND AT THE BEGINNING OF 1990, THE UNITED STATES CONDUCTED TWO MAJOR MILITARY OPERATIONS IN LATIN AMERICA, TO THE UNANIMOUS CONDEMNATION OF THE NATIONS OF LATIN AMERICA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. HOWEVER, THE FIGHTERS FOR "FREEDOM," "DEMOCRACY," AND "HUMAN RIGHTS" IN WESTERN NATIONS HAVE KEPT QUIET OUT OF FEAR OF THE NAKED AGGRESSION AND THE WAY OF THE TYRANT. ON 20 DECEMBER 1989, SEVERAL TENS OF THOUSANDS OF U.S. TROOPS, EQUIPPED WITH THE MOST UP-TO-DATE WEAPONS, BRAZENLY INTRUDED INTO PANAMA, TOPPLING THE NORIEGA GOVERNMENT AND FORCING MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA TO BE TRIED IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS U.S. ACT WAS BY NO MEANS LESS THAN THE SOVIET ACT OF INVADING CZECHOSLOVAKIA AND KIDNAPPING ITS LEADERS AT THAT TIME. THE NEW PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT ESTIMATED THAT THE U.S. INVASION HAD RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF AT LEAST 600 PANAMANIAN SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS AND MADE SEVERAL TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HOMELESS. MORE THAN 5,000 MILITARY AND ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL OF THE FORMER GOVERNMENT WERE ARRESTED BY U.S. TROOPS, AND PANAMA SUFFERED ECONOMIC LOSSES OF $10 BILLION. THE UNITED STATES OPENLY MANIPULATED THE WORK OF ESTABLISHING A NEW PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT, NATIONAL DEFENSE ARMY, POLICE FORCE, AND OTHER STATE APPARATUSES, SO MUCH SO THAT IT RUSHED IN AND RAIDED THE EMBASSIES OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN PANAMA OR DIPLOMATIC APARTMENTS, AND DETAINED THE DIPLOMATIC OFFICIALS OF OTHER COUNTRIES. UNDER THE POWERFUL PRESSURE OF WORLD OPINION, SOME OF THE U.S. TROOPS HAVE WITHDRAWN FROM PANAMA, BUT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT STILL REFUSES TO PULL OUT ALL ITS TROOPS. JUST AFTER ITS INTRUSION INTO PANAMA, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IMMEDIATELY ANNOUNCED, AS SCHEDULED, THE DISPATCH OF A STRONG FLEET OF WARSHIPS INTO THE CARIBBEAN, CLOSE TO THE COAST OF COLOMBIA, FOR WHAT WAS CALLED AN ANTIDRUG MANEUVER, INTERCEPTING PLANES AND VESSELS FOR TRAFFICKING IN DRUGS. ON 5 JANUARY THIS YEAR, THE UNITED STATES, IGNORING THE STRONG OPPOSITION OF LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS, ORDERED A FLEET OF FOUR WARSHIPS, INCLUDING THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER "KENNEDY" AND NUCLEAR-PROPELLED CRUISER "VIRGINIA," TO SAIL TOWARD THE CARIBBEAN TO "COMBAT DRUG SMUGGLING." SUCH A HIGH-HANDED WAY OF IGNORING THE SOVEREIGNTY AND WILL OF LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS AND FORCING THE DEPLOYMENT OF TROOPS IN FRONT OF THE GATES OF OTHER COUNTRIES EVOKED FIERCE REACTIONS IN COLOMBIA AND OTHER LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS. JARAMILLO OSSA, A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FROM THE COLOMBIAN PATRIOTIC UNION, NOTED THAT THE UNITED STATES "VERY NEARLY" INVADED COLOMBIA. THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT ALSO WARNED THE U.S. GOVERNMENT: WITHOUT THE AUTHORIZATION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT BARCO, NO U.S WARSHIPS ARE ALLOWED TO DRAW NEAR THE WATERS OF COLOMBIA. IT ALSO ORDERED ITS NAVAL AND AIR FORCES TO INTENSIFY THEIR SEA PATROLS TO SAFEGUARD THE COUNTRY'S SOVEREIGNTY. AT THE SAME TIME, THE GOVERNMENTS OF COLOMBIA, VENEZUELA, AND SOME OTHER NATIONS REFUSED TO JOIN THE PROPOSED U.S. "DRUG-FIGHTING DRILL" IN THE CARIBBEAN. FACED WITH SUCH A SITUATION, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAD TO ORDER THE "DRUG-FIGHTING FLEET" TO RETURN TO BASE AND CANCEL THE "DRILL." ON THE AFOREMENTIONED ACTS OF THE UNITED STATES, LEADERS OF SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS COMMENTED: WHILE RELAXING THE TENSION WITH THE SOVIET UNION, THE UNITED STATES HAS RESERVED THE "RIGHT" TO INTERFERE BY FORCE IN LATIN AMERICA AND OTHER SMALL AND WEAK COUNTRIES. THE PUBLIC MEDIA OF SOME NATIONS SOLEMNLY POINTED OUT: SUCH MOVES OF U.S. AGGRESSION ARE THE CONTINUATION OF THE CONSISTENT U.S. POLICY OF INTERFERING IN THE AFFAIRS OF LATIN AMERICA AND ALSO THE EXTENSION OF WHAT IS CALLED THE REAGAN DOCTRINE, WHICH STARTED IN THE EARLY 1980'S. IN U.S. RELATIONS WITH LATIN AMERICA THROUGHOUT THE DECADE OF THE 1980'S, THERE WAS A PROBLEM AFFECTING THE SITUATION AS A WHOLE, NAMELY, THE ISSUE OF CENTRAL AMERICA, WHICH HAD ALL ALONG BEEN LISTED IN THE CATEGORY OF EAST-WEST CONFRONTATION BY THE UNITED STATES. THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION EVEN GAVE TOP PRIORITY TO MEETING THE CRISIS IN CENTRAL AMERICA IN ITS FOREIGN POLICY. IN 1981, WHEN REAGAN ENTERED THE WHITE HOUSE, THE SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA STOOD AS FOLLOWS: THE SANDINISTA REVOLUTION HAD WON VICTORY IN NICARAGUA, THE GUERRILLA WAR IN EL SALVADOR WAS ESCALATING, AND A TURBULENT SITUATION HAD STARTED TO EMERGE IN OTHER CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES. THE HUMAN RIGHTS DIPLOMACY PURSUED BY THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION RESULTED IN THE DETERIORATION OF U.S. RELATIONS WITH A CERTAIN NUMBER OF LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS RULED BY JUNTAS. IN 1977 THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION SIGNED THE PANAMA CANAL TREATY WITH THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT, AGREEING TO RETURN TO PANAMA SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE CANAL AND THE CANAL ZONE. BEFORE THE VICTORY OF THE NICARAGUA REVOLUTION, IN 1979 THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION ABANDONED ITS SUPPORT FOR THE TYRANNICAL SOMOSA REGIME AND ESTABLISHED NORMAL RELATIONS WITH THE SANDINISTA REGIME.
TST2-MUC4-0085	SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 -- THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF EL SALVADOR REPORTS TO THE INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT THE TERRORIST OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT . AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAS BEEN COUNTERED BY THE ARMED FORCES IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S LIVES AND POSSESSIONS. THE SITUATION IS UNDER THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES' CONTROL. THE FLMN, WITH A TOTAL DISREGARD FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, HAS UNLEASHED AN INDISCRIMINATE ATTACK ON VARIOUS PLACES IN SAN SALVADOR AND ON THE CAPITALS OF FOUR DEPARTMENTS BY FIRING VERY POWERFUL WEAPONS AND KILLING MANY CIVILIANS. THE GOVERNMENT HEREBY REPORTS THESE TERRORIST ACTIONS BECAUSE THE FMLN ATTACKS ON MILITARY OBJECTIVES HAVE SERIOUSLY ENDANGERED THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS. THIS FMLN ATTACK IS TOTALLY UNJUSTIFIED BECAUSE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS ATTENDED THEM WITH TOTAL POLITICAL HONESTY, TRYING TO FIND MECHANISMS AND RATIONAL SOLUTIONS TO THE CONFLICT. THE FMLN NOT ONLY HAS VIOLATED THE AGREEMENTS IT SIGNED IN MEXICO CITY, BUT ALSO IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA. IT HAS ALSO BRAZENLY MOCKED THE FEELINGS AND THE DESIRE FOR PEACE WANTED BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. THE FMLN TERRORIST ACTIONS HAVE FORCED THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE USE OF ITS LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO DEFEND SOCIETY BY USING THE ARMED FORCES WHICH HAS BEEN FULLY SUPPORTED BY THE PEOPLE. SALVADORAN PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO LOSE THEIR LIBERTY AND FALL INTO THE HANDS OF TOTALITARIAN MARXIST-LENINIST SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE ONE THE FMLN WANTS TO IMPOSE RUTHLESSLY. REPRESENTATIVES FROM VARIOUS COUNTRIES WHO HAVE OBSERVED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE INCIDENTS CAN FULLY CONFIRM THE FACTS. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, IN ADDITION TO BEING VICTIMS OF THE FMLN AGGRESSION, FEEL OUTRAGED BECAUSE THE FMLN STILL HAS THE GALL TO SAY THAT IT IS SPEAKING IN DEFENSE OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WHO, IN THESE SAD TIMES, FEEL OUTRAGED BY THE TERRORIST GROUP'S IRRATIONAL ATTACK. THE GOVERMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF EL SALVADOR REQUESTS THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CONDEMN THIS BRUTAL VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS PERPETRATED BY THE FMLN. IT ALSO ASKS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO CONDEMN THE HIDEOUS CRIMES THE FMLN TROOPS ARE PERPETRATING AGAINST CIVILIANS -- WHO FLATLY REFUSE TO HELP THEM -- AND WHO HAVE REJECTED THEM . THE GOVERNMENT ALSO REQUESTS THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY STRONGLY CONDEMN NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT ORTEGA BECAUSE HE SUPPLIED THE WEAPONS THAT THE TERRORISTS ARE USING TO MASSACRE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.
TST2-MUC4-0086	BOGOTA, 7 AUG 89 -- THE SIMON BOLIVAR NATIONAL COORDINATING BOARD . THE CNG ALSO REQUESTED AN "OPEN AGENDA" FOR ALL OF THESE TALKS AND PRAISED THE "GOVERNMENT'S RECENT WILLINGNESS TO HOLD TALKS." IN ITS REQUEST FOR A "DIALOGUE WITH ALL," THE CNG, THROUGH A DECLARATION ISSUED "FROM THE COLOMBIAN MOUNTAINS" AND BROADCAST ON THE MEDIA, STATES: "WE HAVE NAMED A HIGH-LEVEL COMMISSION AND EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO DO THE SAME." IN ITS DECLARATION, THE CNG "REITERATES ITS DESIRE TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE ARMED CONFLICT" IN COLOMBIA. "WE ARE PLEASED ABOUT THE PATH THAT IS BEING OPENED TOWARD CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS THROUGH THE REFERENDUM AND THE PLEBISCITE," THE DOCUMENT ADDS. HOWEVER, THE COMMUNIQUE ALSO MAINTAINS THAT "IN VIEW OF THE VARIOUS APPROACHES SUGGESTED, WE REAFFIRM OUR BELIEF THAT ONLY A NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WITH BROAD POPULAR PARTICIPATION WILL ENSURE THAT THE CHANGES DEMANDED BY THE MAJORITIES WILL BE MADE." IN ADDITION TO THE NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, "THERE SHOULD ALSO BE TRUE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REFORMS AS WELL AS THE EFFECTIVE EXERCISE OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY." THE DECLARATION CONDEMNS "THE DIRTY WAR, WHICH, IN THE PAST FEW DAYS, HAS RESULTED IN THE ASSASSINATIONS OF JUDGES, LEFT-WING POLITICAL LEADERS, LABOR UNION LEADERS, AND PEASANTS, AND IN THE ATTEMPTED MURDER OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES." THE DOCUMENT IS SIGNED BY JACOBO ARENAS, IDEOLOGUE AND LEADER OF THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA, AND BY JAVIER ROBLES FROM THE PRO - MAOIST POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY. IT WAS ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK THAT THESE GROUPS WILL JOIN THE DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT. GILFARDO FERNANDEZ FROM THE PRO - INDIAN QUINTIN LAME FRONT AND VALENTIN GONZALEZ FROM THE REVOLUTIONARY WORKERS PARTY ALSO SIGNED THE DOCUMENT. THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT -- WHICH, SINCE JANUARY, HAS BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH THE GOVERNMENT FOR ITS REINCORPORATION INTO CIVILIAN LIFE -- AND THE PRO - CASTRO ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION -- WHICH HAS ALWAYS REFUSED TO HOLD A DIALOGUE -- ARE ALSO MEMBERS OF THE CNG.
TST2-MUC4-0087	HAMBURG , 16 DEC 89 -- DIE WELT: YOUR THOUGHTS ARE FOCUSED ON CHILE, BUT LET US BRIEFLY LOOK AT EUROPE NEVERTHELESS. THE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION IN EAST EUROPE HAS ALSO BEEN A SENSATION TO CHILE. WHAT HOPES DO YOU PLACE IN THESE GIGANTIC RADICAL CHANGES? AYLWIN: I THINK THAT THE CHANGES IN EAST EUROPE ARE OF VERY GREAT IMPORTANCE FOR MANKIND. THEY GIVE US SATISFACTION AND HOPE. THE OPENING OF THE BERLIN WALL SYMBOLIZES THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA IN RELATIONS BETWEEN EAST AND WEST AS WELL AS THE DESIRE OF THE GERMANS TO ACHIEVE UNITY AGAIN. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS SITUATION LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN MILITARY SPENDING AND TO CLOSER RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PEOPLES. DIE WELT: WHAT EFFECTS DO YOU SEE FOR A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY SUCH AS CHILE? AYLWIN: I SEE TWO EFFECTS. FIRST, A SYMBOLIC EFFECT. CHILE IS TRADITIONALLY A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY. NOW THE LONG PERIOD OF A DICTATORIAL REGIME IS ENDING, HOWEVER. THIS EXPLOSION OF FREEDOM COINCIDES WITH THE RESTORATION OF DEMOCRACY IN CHILE. THAT IS A STIMULATING FEELING. WE ARE EMBARKING ON THE ROAD OF HUMANITY. SECOND, THERE IS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE DANGER OF COMMUNISM IN OUR COUNTRY; PEOPLE SAY THAT COMMUNISM COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR DEMOCRATIC FUTURE. I THINK THAT THE EVENTS IN EAST EUROPE AND THE SOVIET UNION DEMONSTRATE THAT COMMUNISM IS NO LONGER A DANGER FOR THE WORLD. NOR FOR CHILE. DIE WELT: CHILE HAS THE BEST ORGANIZED COMMUNIST PARTY IN LATIN AMERICA. HAS THIS PARTY CHANGED? WHAT WAS ITS REACTION? AYLWIN: LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SITUATION OF SUCH A MONOLITHIC AND COHERENT PARTY. IT WAS ILLEGAL AND WORKED UNDERGROUND FOR A LONG TIME. HOWEVER, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY COMMUNIST PARTY CAN IGNORE THE EVENTS IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD WHICH HAS SO FAR BEEN DOMINATED BY COMMUNIST PARTIES. THE CHILEAN COMMUNIST PARTY LEADERS HAVE ADMITTED THAT THIS IS A UNIVERSAL PROCESS. DIE WELT: WHAT RELATIONSHIP DO YOU HAVE WITH VOLODIA TEITELBOIM, THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY? DO YOU SPEAK WITH HIM? DO YOU SEE HIM SOMETIMES? AYLWIN: WE HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER FROM THE TIME WHEN WE WERE BOTH SENATORS, MEANING PRIOR TO 1973. WE WERE POLITICAL OPPONENTS, BUT WE OFTEN TALKED WITH EACH OTHER. SINCE THEN, WE HAVE MET ONLY ONCE, AT A POLITICAL FUNCTION. MY RIVALS IN THIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN HAVE OFTEN MISREPRESENTED OUR RELATIONSHIP, AND HAVE DESCRIBED ME AS TEITELBOIM'S SECRET ALLY. HOWEVER, I THINK THAT PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT PERSUASIONS CAN TALK WITH EACH OTHER AND CAN REACH AGREEMENT. THAT HAS BEEN DONE IN CHILE WITH SOME SUCCESS. DIE WELT: THE COMMUNIST PARTY BACKED YOUR CANDIDACY. WILL IT BE REPRESENTED IN THE NEW GOVERNMENT? AYLWIN: NOT AT ALL. DIE WELT: BUT THE FUTURE GOVERNMENT WILL BE A LEFT-CENTER GOVERNMENT AND WILL REFLECT THE COMPOSITION OF THE OPPOSITION TODAY. AYLWIN: YES, CHILE WILL HAVE A LEFT-CENTER GOVERNMENT. THE VARIOUS SOCIALIST CURRENTS WILL BE REPRESENTED. HOWEVER, THE STRONGEST MOVEMENT IS THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHICH IS IN THE CENTER. DIE WELT: DO YOU THINK THAT FOLLOWING THESE ELECTIONS, THE PANORAMA OF THE OPPOSITION WILL CHANGE? AYLWIN: I HAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. THERE HAVE BEEN FOUR FAMILIES IN THE PAST -- THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC FAMILY, THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATICALLY-ORIENTED FAMILY OF THE OLD RADICAL PARTY, THE SOCIALIST FAMILY, AND THE FAMILY OF THE RIGHT CENTER. THEY ALL WANT TO SURVIVE. DIE WELT: MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT THE SOCIALIST RICARDO LAGOS IS THE STRONGEST FIGURE OF THE OPPOSITION ALLIANCE. WHAT ROLE WILL HE PLAY IN THE FUTURE? AYLWIN: HE WILL CONCENTRATE ON PARLIAMENTARY WORK AS A SENATOR. AS IS THE CASE IN EVERY PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY, HE CANNOT BE A MEMBER OF THE GOVERNMENT AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF CONGRESS.
TST2-MUC4-0088	SAN SALVADOR, 14 NOV 89 -- THE AIR FORCE THIS AFTERNOON RESUMED ITS ATTACKS ON THE NORTHEASTERN SECTORS OF SAN SALVADOR WHERE THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT REBELS HAVE BEEN ENTRENCHED SINCE SATURDAY. AT LEAST FOUR PLANES, THREE "PUSH AND PULLS" AND AN "A-37" HAVE BEEN STRAFING AND BOMBING THE REBEL POSITIONS IN ZACAMIL, AYUTUXTEPEQUE, AND SOYAPANGO SINCE 1330 . THE PLANES FLY AROUND IN CIRCLES AND DIVE AGAINST THE REBEL POSITIONS. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THIS, THE ECHOS OF HEAVY-CALIBER MACHINEGUNS AND EXPLOSIONS CAN BE HEARD CAUSING PANIC AMONG THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN SAN SALVADOR. THE REBELS RESPOND WITH RIFLE AND MACHINEGUN FIRE.
TST2-MUC4-0089	BOGOTA, 30 MAR 89 -- COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO TODAY MET WITH 8 OF THE 13 MEMBERS OF THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT "TEAM OF SPOKESMEN" AT THE NARINO PALACE. BARCO AND THE M-19 MEMBERS TALKED ABOUT THE PEACE PROCESS STARTED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS. A PRESIDENTIAL PALACE SOURCE TOLD EFE THAT THE GUERRILLA REPRESENTATIVES DISCUSSED WITH PRESIDENT BARCO SOME OF THE ISSUES TO BE DEBATED AT THE "WORKING ROUNDTABLES." THE "WORKING ROUNDTABLES" COMPRISE DELEGATES OF THE GUERRILLAS, THE GOVERNMENT, AND THE POLITICAL PARTIES REPRESENTED IN THE COLOMBIAN CONGRESS, WHO WILL EXCHANGE VIEWS ON THE CHANGES THE COUNTRY NEEDS. THE M-19 DELEGATES ARRIVED AT THE NARINO PALACE, LOCATED IN DOWNTOWN BOGOTA, UNDER STRICT SECURITY MEASURES AT 1800 LOCAL TIME . MEANWHILE, AT THE PEACE VILLAGE IN THE MOUNTAINS OF CAUCA DEPARTMENT, 350 KM SOUTHWEST OF BOGOTA, M-19 COMMANDER CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ RELEASED A COMMUNIQUE IN WHICH HE ACCUSED THE COLOMBIAN ARMY OF ATTACKING AN M-19 GROUP ON 26 MARCH. ACCORDING TO PIZARRO, THE ATTACK WAS STAGED BY THE MILITARY TO "CREATE OBSTACLES FOR THE PEACE PROCESS." HE ADDED THAT COMMANDER MARCO CHALITA, COMMANDER OF THE M-19'S "SOUTHERN FRONT," WAS SLIGHTLY INJURED IN THE FIGHTING. ON 26 MARCH, 9TH BRIGADE TROOPS CLASHED WITH THE "AMANDA RINCON" GROUP, LED BY CHALITA, IN A RURAL AREA OF PITALITO MUNICIPALITY, HUILA DEPARTMENT. DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL MANUEL JAIME GUERRERO PAZ DESCRIBED THE CLASH AS "AN UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT." PIZARRO SAID IN A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED AT THE PEACE VILLAGE TODAY THAT THE TROOPS ATTACKED THE REBELS AND THAT "TWO OF OUR COMRADES WERE KILLED AND THREE OTHERS WOUNDED." THE M-19 COMMANDER SAID "HE SHARED THE DEFENSE MINISTER'S VIEWPOINT," AND HE SAID "OBSTACLES STILL MUST BE OVERCOME" TO ACHIEVE A NATIONAL RECONCILIATION. THE M-19 BEGAN TALKS WITH THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT IN JANUARY. FOLLOWING A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT BARCO'S ENVOYS, THEY AGREED ON THE CREATION OF "ROUNDTABLES." LAST WEEK, THE M-19 AND GOVERNMENT MINISTER RAUL OREJUELA MET AT THE PEACE VILLAGE, WHERE THE GUERRILLAS PRESENTED THE NAMES OF THE DELEGATES THAT WOULD PARTICIPATE AT THE "ROUNDTABLES," WHICH ARE SCHEDULED TO BEGIN DELIBERATIONS ON 3 APRIL.
TST2-MUC4-0090	TEGUCIGALPA, 29 APR 88 -- IS THERE ANY UNREST BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE LAWS PASSED BY CONGRESS? NO, THERE IS NO UNREST BECAUSE OF LAWS PASSED BY CONGRESS. SOME MEASURES THAT HAVE AFFECTED INCOME HAVE BEEN ADOPTED, BUT WE WILL MAKE PROGRESS ANYHOW. WILL YOU ASK THAT SOME OF THESE LAWS BE RECONSIDERED? NO, I AM NOT GOING TO DO THAT. THERE IS, HOWEVER, THE LAW ON COFFEE TAXES WHICH COULD BE DISCUSSED WITH PRODUCERS BECAUSE THE LAW-DECREE ON COFFEE IS VERY DRASTIC. HOWEVER, THE COUNTRY IS MAKING PROGRESS, AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES IN VARIOUS SECTORS--COMMERCE, CONSTRUCTION, AND MANUFACTURING--ARE ON THE INCREASE. SOME SECTORS HAVE SOME PROBLEMS, BUT I BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO RESOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS. DO YOU HAVE ECONOMIC ADVISERS, MR PRESIDENT? ANY PERSON CONSULTED IS AN ECONOMIC ADVISER. THE MAIN ECONOMIC ADVISERS, HOWEVER, ARE THOSE IN THE GOVERNMENT. IT IS BEING SAID THAT POLITICALLY SPEAKING YOU HAVE BEEN LEFT ON YOUR OWN. IS THIS HOW YOU SEE IT ALSO? NO WAY. HOW COULD I BE ALONE? ON THE CONTRARY, WE ARE DOING WELL. I BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO RECEIVE MORE SUPPORT. I DO NOT SEE WHY I COULD BE LEFT ALONE. THERE IS THE GOVERNMENT AND THE EXPERTS. WE ARE ESTABLISHING RELATIONS WITH THE PARTY, WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE OF THE PARTY. ARE EMPLOYEES GOING TO BE PRESSURED? I DO NOT BELIEVE THEY ARE GOING TO BE FORCED TO DO ANYTHING BECAUSE NO LAW SAYS THAT THE EMPLOYEES OF A GOVERNMENT MUST SUPPORT ANY PARTICULAR PARTY. HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT IF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WORKS IN UNISON, AS IT HAS BEEN DOING, THEN ALL MEMBERS OF THE LIBERAL PARTY WILL BE HAPPY TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PARTY TO GUARANTEE A NEW VICTORY. WOULD YOU SUPPORT REFORMS TO THE ELECTORAL LAW? WE DISCUSSED THAT ISSUE TODAY. APPARENTLY THE NATIONAL CONVENTION, WHICH IS THE PARTY'S TOP AUTHORITY, HAS APPROVED SOME REFORMS. DO YOU AGREE WITH INTERNAL ELECTIONS TAKING PLACE SIMULTANEOUSLY ? I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL IF THEY TAKE PLACE IN ONE SINGLE DAY, BUT WE DID NOT DISCUSS THAT TODAY, AND I DO NOT WANT TO DISCUSS DETAILS ABOUT THAT. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT EITHER YOUR GOVERNMENT OR YOURSELF COULD HAVE BEEN POLITICALLY HARMED BY THE LATEST CRISIS ENDURED BY THE COUNTRY? I DO NOT THINK SO. I THINK THAT WHAT HAPPENED WILL BENEFIT THE COUNTRY. ACTS OF VIOLENCE ARE REGRETTABLE, BUT THOSE THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE HAVE SHOWN THAT WE IN HONDURAS ARE NOT IMMUNE TO VIOLENCE. THE SAME DAY INCIDENTS WERE TAKING PLACE HERE, 13 PERSONS DIED IN SAN SALVADOR AS A RESULT OF A BOMB EXPLOSION. THE LOSS OF LIVES IS UNFORTUNATE AND VIOLENCE AGAINST A BUILDING AND FACILITIES NEXT TO THE U.S. EMBASSY IS REGRETTABLE BECAUSE THIS DOES NOT HELP THE COUNTRY. HAVE YOU TALKED WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ABOUT AN INDEMNITY? IT IS BEING SAID THAT DAMAGE AMOUNTS TO $6 MILLION. NO, WE HAVE NOTHING ABOUT $6 MILLION. WHAT WE HAVE RECEIVED IS A NOTE FROM THE U.S. AMBASSADOR THE DAY AFTER THE INCIDENTS. THEY ARE ENTITLED TO FILE A PROTEST. THE NOTE SAYS THAT LATER THERE WILL BE A . HONDURAS SIGNED THE GENEVA CONVENTION ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENTS WHEN ACTIONS ARE CARRIED OUT AGAINST DIPLOMATIC INSTALLATIONS. THE FORCING OF RADIO STATIONS TO JOIN A RADIO NETWORK AND THE IMPOSING OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY HAVE BEEN THE SOURCE OF MUCH CRITICISM AGAINST YOUR GOVERNMENT. I HAVE HEARD SOME CRITICISM BECAUSE OF THE NETWORK. PERHAPS WE HAD IT FOR A FEW HOURS TOO MANY. REGARDING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY, HOWEVER, THE PEOPLE HAVE RESPONDED POSITIVELY BECAUSE ONE MORE CASUALTY WOULD HAVE HAD NEGATIVE EFFECTS. THE STATE OF EMERGENCY MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO COOL DOWN, AND THOSE ON THE STREETS RETURNED TO THEIR HOMES. I FEEL IT WAS BENEFICIAL. THE DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY DECREE WAS BASED ON THE CONSTITUTION AND ON PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY. CONGRESS WAS INFORMED ABOUT THIS. I BELIEVE THIS WAS A POSITIVE MEASURE, AND THIS IS HOW THE PEOPLE HAVE VIEWED IT, POSITIVELY. DO YOU BELIEVE THE SITUATION HAS BEEN OVERCOME? WE DO NOT KNOW IF THE SITUATION IS OVER. I THINK SO. I BELIEVE THAT WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT TEMPERS GOT HOT FOR A MOMENT, AND THAT SOME SECTORS, WHICH I DO NOT WANT TO NAME BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE PEOPLE, TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS. PERHAPS SOME PEOPLE TRIED TO MAKE POLITICAL GAINS AND THE SITUATION GOT OUT OF HAND. I BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT EVERYTHING IS MORE OR LESS QUIET. THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING WITH THE VARIOUS SECTORS. THERE IS A SMALL STRIKE BY A SMALL GROUP OF HEALTH WORKERS. CHECKS WITH SALARY INCREASES COVERING A 4-MONTH PERIOD WILL BE PAID TODAY. SOME READJUSTMENTS WILL BE MADE TO FAVOR SOME EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE INCREASES WE HAD PROMISED. WE WANT TO APPEAL TO HEALTH SECTOR LABOR UNIONS TO SET ASIDE ANY CONFRONTATIONAL ATTITUDE BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS MEETING AND WILL MEET ALL ITS COMMITMENTS. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE LATEST INCIDENTS WITH NICARAGUA? THESE ARE NOT THE FIRST INCIDENTS. I BELIEVE INCIDENTS WILL CONTINUE HAPPENING. HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT IS PREPARED TO ENFORCE RESPECT FOR THE COUNTRY'S SOVEREIGNTY.
TST2-MUC4-0091	CLANDESTINE, 14 NOV 89 -- ATTENTION; PAY CLOSE ATTENTION. WE HAVE RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING REPORT FROM ZACATECOLUCA, LA PAZ DEPARTMENT: WE DENOUNCE -- OUR COMRADES HAVE DENOUNCED -- THE ROLE PLAYED BY THE GREEN CROSS, WHICH HAS BEEN DISLODGING THE POPULATION IN THE FOLLOWING NEIGHBORHOODS: 27 DE SEPTIEMBRE, CHINCHONTEPEC, AND SANTA LUCIA, LOCATED IN NORTHERN ZACATECOLUCA. THE GREEN CROSS IS SERVING AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR DMIFA TO DISLODGE THE POPULATION. SOME DMIFA AGENTS ARE WEARING GREEN CROSS UNIFORMS TO DO THAT JOB. THEY GO FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE, IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES WITH GREEN CROSS DOCUMENTS. THEY ARE ASKING FAMILIES ONE BY ONE TO MOVE OUT, TELLING THEM THAT THOSE AREAS WILL BE BOMBED. WE URGE ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE RED CROSS, THE GREEN CROSS, AND RESCUE TEAMS NOT TO PERMIT THE USE OF INSIGNIAS, UNIFORMS, AND VEHICLES OF HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS BY ARMY TROOPS. THE DISLODGING OF PEOPLE IN SAN SALVADOR AND NOW IN THE 27 DE SEPTIEMBRE NEIGHBORHOOD IN ZACATECOLUCA IS BEING DONE IN ORDER TO PROCEED WITH THE BOMBING OF THESE DENSELY POPULATED CIVILIAN NEIGHBORHOODS.
TST2-MUC4-0092	SAN SALVADOR, 19 NOV 89 -- DEAR SALVADORAN PEOPLE, OUR REPUBLIC, OUR SOCIETY, AND OUR PEOPLE BECAME THE VICTIMS OF A MURDEROUS AND TERRORIST AGGRESSION 8 DAYS AGO. THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT CARRIED OUT AN INCURSION IN OUR COUNTRY AND VENTED ALL ITS FURY AND ALL ITS TERROR AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. THIS VIOLENT, IRRATIONAL, ILLOGICAL, AND SENSELESS ACTION BEGAN 8 DAYS AGO AGAINST PEACE-LOVING PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WORK, CHOOSE THEIR OWN DESTINY, AND SEEK THEIR WELFARE. ON THIS OCCASION I AM DEEPLY MOVED BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S ATTITUDE, AND, IN MY ROLE AS DEFENSE AND PUBLIC SECURITY MINISTER, I HEARTILY CONGRATULATE THEM. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S ATTITUDE HAS REFLECTED THEIR STOICISM, STRONG WILL, AND INDOMITABLE SPIRIT, HOPE, AND FAITH IN GOD AND THE ARMED FORCES. SALVADORAN PEOPLE, YOUR ATTITUDE IN RECENT DAYS HAS BEEN DIGNIFIED AND IT HAS SET AN EXAMPLE. IT IS WORTHY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WHO HAVE ALWAYS PROVED THEIR FAITH AND WILLINGNESS TO DEFEND A JUST AND NOBLE CAUSE, THE HOMELAND'S CAUSE. THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT HAS GIVEN THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE THE WILL TO LIVE, LOVE, AND ACHIEVE PEACE. YOUR ATTITUDE ENCOURAGES US, PLACES US UNDER AN OBLIGATION, AND URGES US -- AS AN INSTITUTION AT THE SERVICE OF THE PEOPLE -- TO CONTINUE THE STRUGGLE TO THE END, SO THAT WE MAY ERADICATE FOREVER THE TERROR, VIOLENCE, AND DISRESPECT THAT THE TERRORIST FORCES HAVE TRIED TO IMPOSE ON OUR HARD-WORKING AND INNOCENT PEOPLE. SALVADORAN PEOPLE, YOUR ATTITUDE IS EXEMPLARY, AND WE, THE PROFESSIONAL SOLDIERS, ARE PREPARED -- LIKE WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN -- TO SUPPORT AND DEFEND UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND IN ANY EVENT THE SECURITY, ORDER, TRANQUILLITY, WORK, AND PEACE THAT ALL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO ENJOY. ONWARD, SALVADORAN PEOPLE. AS AN INSTITUTION WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT. YOUR SUPPORT IS IMPORTANT AND YOUR UNDERSTANDING IS NECESSARY. YOU MUST BELIEVE IN AND TRUST THE ARMED FORCES, BECAUSE WE, WHO ARE ALSO PEOPLE LIKE YOU, UNDERSTAND THE LEGITIMATE DEMAND AND DESIRE FOR PEACE, FAITH, AND HOPE WHICH PREVAIL IN THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF ALL SALVADORAN CITIZENS -- AND WE ARE PLEASED AND SATISFIED TO DEFEND THEM. THE ARMED FORCES ARE AN INSTITUTION WHICH HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GUARANTEEING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S WELFARE, AND THEY ARE HIGHLY ENCOURAGED, DEEPLY PLEASED, AND DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THEIR WORK. THEY WILL DEFEND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND GUARANTEE THEM A FUTURE WITH DIGNITY, PEACE, WELFARE, AND SECURITY.
TST2-MUC4-0093	HAVANA , 14 NOV 89 -- GUERRILLA UNITS ARE FIGHTING SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT FORCES A FEW METERS FROM THEIR GENERAL BARRACKS AND IN THE CAPITAL NEIGHBORHOODS OF SAN MARTIN AND GENERAL ARCE. A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN, AND BROADCAST BY RADIO VENCEREMOS INDICATES THAT THE INSURGENT FORCES THIS MORNING PENETRATED PERIPHERAL NEIGHBORHOODS OF SAN SALVADOR. THE COMMUNIQUE ALSO SAYS THAT HEAVY FIGHTING IS TAKING PLACE NEAR THE SAN BENITO POLICE BARRACKS, THE ZONA ROSA, THE NATIONAL MUSEUM, AND THE INTERNATIONAL FAIR. RADIO VENCEREMOS REPORTS THAT FIGHTING IS TAKING PLACE THROUGHOUT SAN SALVADOR; IT ALSO DENOUNCED THE DEATH OF MANY CIVILIANS DUE TO THE INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S AIR FORCE. ACCORDING TO INSURGENT RADIO VENCEREMOS THE PRESENCE OF THE GUERRILLA FORCES IN THE MAIN CITIES OF THE COUNTRY HAS ENCOURAGED POPULAR UPRISINGS AND THE GROWING PARTICIPATION OF THE POPULATION IN THE STRUGGLE. THE REPORT ADDS THAT THE REBEL UNITS CONTINUE FIGHTING THE ARMY IN SEVEN OTHER DEPARTMENTS OF THE COUNTRY.
TST2-MUC4-0094	BOGOTA, 20 APR 89 -- FURTHERMORE, WE HAVE HAD TO STRUGGLE AGAINST MANY OF OUR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN'S SKEPTICISM AND PESSIMISM. THE FIRST THING THE GOVERNMENT DID WAS TO CONSOLIDATE ITS BASES TO WAGE A STRUGGLE AGAINST THOSE TERRORIST GROUPS WITH WHATEVER FIRMNESS AND PERSEVERANCE WAS CALLED FOR. WE STRENGTHENED INVESTIGATION ORGANIZATIONS, WE CREATED SPECIAL PUBLIC COURTS. WE MODIFIED PENAL LAWS AND PROCEDURES. WE INTRODUCED NEW MEASURES TO ENCOURAGE CITIZEN PARTICIPATION AND TO PROTECT CITIZENS. WE FORMED NEW COMPONENTS TO BOLSTER OUR PUBLIC FORCES. OUR EFFORTS TOOK QUITE A BIT OF TIME. ONE CANNOT PROVIDE AN OVERNIGHT SOLUTION FOR THESE COMPLEX PROBLEMS WITH WHICH YOU ARE ALL VERY FAMILIAR. ONCE THE INSTITUTIONS IN CHARGE OF MAINTAINING PUBLIC ORDER AND SECURITY WERE STRENGTHENED, WE CONCENTRATED OUR AVAILABLE RESOURCES ON SOLVING THE CRIMES COMMITTED BY THOSE TERRORIST GROUPS. THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY POSITIVE, BOTH IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING -- WHICH IS THE CENTRAL FOCUS OF MANY OF THESE TERRORIST GROUPS -- AND IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST GANGS OF HIRED ASSASSINS AND PRIVATE JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS, ALSO KNOWN AS DEATH SQUADS. NEVER BEFORE HAD WE ACHIEVED SUCH POSITIVE RESULTS. I AM SURE THAT EVEN THOUGH WE WILL FACE DIFFICULTIES AND OBSTACLES, WE WILL CONTINUE TO WIN THIS BATTLE AGAINST TERRORISM. TO DATE, WE HAVE DISBANDED 23 GANGS OF HIRED ASSASSINS OPERATING IN ENVIGADO IN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, HUICAN IN BOYACA DEPARTMENT, PUERTO LOPEZ AND SAN MARTIN IN META DEPARTMENT, LA ROCHELA IN SANTANDER DEPARTMENT, AND LLANOS DEL YARI IN CAQUETA DEPARTMENT. THESE GANGS OF HIRED ASSASSINS HAD PARTICIPATED IN MOST OF THE MURDERS OF THE COUNTRY'S LEFTIST LEADERS.
TST2-MUC4-0095	GUATEMALA CITY, 18 MAY 90 -- GENERAL HECTOR GRAMAJO MORALES HAS REPORTED THAT LAST NIGHT'S TERRORIST ACTS WERE PROBABLY INTENDED TO DAMAGE GUATEMALAN AIR FORCE INSTALLATIONS, BUT ONE OF THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES WENT OFF PREMATURELY. HE ADDED THAT ONE OF THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES HIT A WALL OF THE AIR FORCE INSTALLATIONS AND THE SHOCK WAVE FROM THE EXPLOSION DAMAGED SOME BUILDINGS. ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS, THE ATTACK WAS PROBABLY A PROPAGANDA PLOY BECAUSE THE DEVICES WERE RUDIMENTARY AND SIMILAR TO FIRECRACKERS. THE TERRORIST ACTIONS SEEM TO BE MOTIVATED BY THE FACT THAT THE IRREGULAR GROUPS ARE SHRINKING CONSIDERABLY. EVIDENCE OF THIS IS THE FACT THAT A SUBVERSIVE WHO SURRENDERED ON THE SOUTHERN COAST WAS CARRYING SOME IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IN WHICH THE GUERRILLAS ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD MADE A BIG EFFORT TO SHOW THEIR PRESENCE, BUT THAT NOTHING SUBSTANTIAL RESULTED AND THEY SUFFERED MANY CASUALTIES INSTEAD, GRAMAJO SAID. WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE IMPACT OF THESE TERRORIST ACTIONS ON THE TALKS BEING HELD IN OSLO, NORWAY, GRAMAJO SAID THAT THOSE WHO ARE TAKING PART IN THE TALKS DO NOT MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH THE GROUPS THAT CARRY OUT THE TERRORIST ACTIONS. AMONG THOSE GROUPS, THERE IS ONE FACTION THAT IS CALLED THE INTERNATIONAL MILITANT GROUP. THIS FACTION IS COMPRISED OF PERSONS WHO LOVE ADVENTURE; THESE PEOPLE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SUBVERSIVE GROUPS TO ENGAGE IN SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES.
TST2-MUC4-0096	LIMA, 21 MAR 90 -- THE PERUVIAN NAVY TODAY FORMALLY DENIED THAT ITS INTELLIGENCE SERVICES HAD UNCOVERED A PLOT TO ASSASSINATE WRITER MARIO VARGAS LLOSA, WHO IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE FAVORITE CANDIDATE TO WIN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THAT WILL BE HELD ON 8 APRIL. CITING AN ALLEGED NAVY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, A TELEVISION STATION CARRIED A REPORT -- WHICH WAS LATER PICKED UP BY A NEWSPAPER -- TACITLY SUGGESTING THAT THE COMMUNIST TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT AND PROMINENT PEOPLE IN THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA, WERE INVOLVED IN THE ALLEGED PLOT. THE NAVY HAS ISSUED AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE IN WHICH IT DENIES THE ALLEGED SOURCE OF THE DOCUMENT AND STATES THAT THE ALLEGATIONS, CONSIDERING THE RANK OF THE PERSONALITIES MENTIONED, COULD BE A MATTER AFFECTING NATIONAL SECURITY. THE REPORT ON THE PLOT WAS INITIALLY CARRIED BY CHANNEL FOUR DURING A POLITICAL PROGRAM. IT WAS LATER PICKED UP BY THE CENTER-RIGHT WING NEWSPAPER EXPRESO, ONE OF THE LEADING NEWSPAPERS IN THE COUNTRY. ALVARO VARGAS LLOSA, A SON AND SPOKESMAN FOR THE PERUVIAN WRITER, STATED THAT "WE GIVE GREAT CREDENCE TO THE DOCUMENT SHOWN ON TELEVISION BUT THE AUTHORITIES SEEM TO HAVE IGNORED IT. IT CONCERNS MY FATHER AND IT SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY." ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENT, THE AUTHENTICITY OF WHICH HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY DENIED BY THE NAVY, AN MRTA HIT SQUAD WOULD MURDER THE NOVELIST AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THE DEMOCRATIC FRONT AND OTHER PERSONALITIES OF THE CENTER-RIGHT WING COALITION. THE REPORT ADDS THAT THE PLOT MAY HAVE BEEN CONCOCTED EARLY IN DECEMBER LAST YEAR AT A MEETING REPORTEDLY ATTENDED BY PRESIDENT GARCIA, INTERIOR MINISTER AGUSTIN MANTILLA, TWO SENIOR LEADERS OF THE RULING AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE , AND BY AN UNIDENTIFIED MRTA MEMBER.
TST2-MUC4-0097	SAN SALVADOR, 22 NOV 89 -- THE NATIONAL GUARD HAS ANNOUNCED THAT SEVEN FOREIGNERS WERE ARRESTED BECAUSE THEY ARE SUSPECTED OF COLLABORATING WITH THE GANGS OF TERRORISTS THAT OPERATE IN THE CAPITAL. THE FOREIGNERS WERE ARRESTED IN THE VICINITY OF THE ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH, LOCATED ON 63 AVENUE SOUTH AND OLYMPIC AVENUE IN THIS CAPITAL. THEY HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS: LUIS PEREZ, FRANCISCO RIERA, AND MARIA ESTER LLERENTE, SPANIARDS; WINSTON PERCIVAL ZEA MELENDEZ, GUATEMALAN; JOSEPHINE CAMERON VICTOR, U.S. CITIZEN; KAREN RUDD, CANADIAN; AND MARCELA RODRIGUEZ, COLOMBIAN. THE SPANIARDS HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER TO THE SPANISH EMBASSY, AND THE OTHERS WERE TURNED OVER TO THE TREASURY POLICE FOR INVESTIGATION. THE INITIAL REPORT SAYS THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS CONTRAVENED THE IMMIGRATION LAWS BY MEDDLING IN DOMESTIC POLITICAL AFFAIRS.
TST2-MUC4-0098	SAN JOSE , 27 SEP 89 -- THE GUATEMALAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS , WHOSE TOP LEADERS WERE KIDNAPPED, MURDERED, OR HAD TO GO INTO HIDING DURING THE LAST FEW WEEKS, TODAY DEMANDED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S SOLIDARITY TO CONTAIN THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE THAT HAS SHAKEN THE COUNTRY OVER THE LAST 2 MONTHS. TWO MEMBERS OF THE AEU COORDINATING BOARD, WHO LAST WEEK WENT INTO EXILE, SAID THAT IT IS URGENT THAT A PERMAMENT UN RAPPORTEUR BE SENT TO GUATEMALA TO CERTIFY THE CONTINUAL AND INCREASING HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN THE COUNTRY. THE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS ALSO CALLED FOR GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO SEND DELEGATIONS TO GUATEMALA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, "TO PRESSURE THE VINICIO CEREZO GOVERNMENT TO STOP THE CAMPAIGN OF TERROR AND THE BLOODBATH BEING PREPARED BY THE ARMY TO CONTAIN THE STUDENT AND PEOPLES' MOVEMENTS." THE AEU REPRESENTATIVES SAID THEY HAD EVIDENCE THAT THE RECENT KIDNAPPING OF 12 STUDENT LEADERS, OUT OF WHICH 5 WERE LATER FOUND MURDERED WITH BRUTAL SIGNS OF TORTURE, "WAS DIRECTLY PLANNED AND CARRIED OUT BY THE GUATEMALAN ARMY. THESE SAME STUDENTS BELIEVE THAT VINICIO CEREZO'S CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT "KNOWS WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CAMPAIGN OF TERROR, AND IT WILL NOT TAKE ACTION BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS AN ACCOMPLICE OF THE MILITARY." THE AEU LEADERS, WHO DID NOT DARE GIVE THEIR NAMES BECAUSE THEIR FAMILIES "COULD SUFFER WORSE CONSEQUENCES IN GUATEMALA," INSISTED THAT "THE ONLY THING REMAINING FOR GUATEMALANS TO FACE THE TERROR AND VIOLENCE IS INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY." "THE SITUATION IS TERRIBLE. THE HUMAN RIGHTS PROSECUTOR HIMSELF TOLD US THAT HE COULD DO NOTHING TO CONTAIN THIS WAVE OF REPRESSION AND ADVISED US THAT WE BETTER SEEK INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE," ONE OF THE EXILED AEU LEADERS SAID. ACCORDING TO THEM, THE WAVE OF REPRESSION OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS AGAINST GUATEMALAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS "IS THE WORST SINCE 1978," WHEN NUMEROUS UNIVERSITY LEADERS WERE MURDERED, INCLUDING AEU SECRETARY GENERAL OLIVERIO CASTANEDA, KILLED AT POINT-BLANK RANGE WHILE HEADING A DEMONSTRATION IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CAPITAL. CASTANEDA'S MURDER FORCED THE AEU TO ELIMINATE THE POST OF SECRETARY GENERAL AND MODIFY ITS STRATEGIES SO ITS TOP LEADERS WOULD NOT BECOME EASY TARGETS OF REPRESSION. HOWEVER, IN LIGHT OF THE LATEST EVENTS, THESE CHANGES SEEM TO HAVE HAD LITTLE EFFECT. "BECAUSE NOW THEY CANNOT IDENTIFY ANY PARTICULAR LEADER TO KILL, LIKE THEY DID WITH OLIVERIO, THIS TIME THEY HAVE ATTACKED US ALL," ONE OF THE BANISHED LEADERS , WHO ARRIVED IN COSTA RICA LAST WEEKEND, SAID. SINCE 21 AUGUST, WHEN THE CAMPAIGN OF STUDENT KIDNAPPINGS AND MURDERS BEGAN, OF THE 16 MEMBERS OF THE AEU EXECUTIVE COORDINATING BOARD, THREE WERE MURDERED, SEVEN ARE STILL MISSING, FOUR HAD TO GO INTO HIDING, AND TWO WENT INTO EXILE. "I WAS TOLD THROUGH A FRIEND: YOUR TURN IS ON 4 SEPTEMBER. I THEN HAD TO HIDE UNTIL I WAS ABLE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY," ONE OF THE EXILED TOLD AFP WITH ANGUISH. "WE REALLY DID NOT EXPECT THIS. WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO BE POLITICALLY NEUTRALIZED, BUT NEVER THOUGHT THEY WOULD ORDER US KIDNAPPED AND MURDERED," ANOTHER OF THE STUDENTS ADMITTED. FOR BOTH LEADERS "THE ARMY'S REPRESSIVE CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE AEU SEEKS TO SCARE THE POPULATION AND STOP THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT THAT BECAME MOTIVATED FOLLOWING THE LAST TEACHERS' STRIKE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY." HOWEVER, THEY CONCLUDED, "THE ARMY WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO END THE AEU BECAUSE TO DO SO THE ARMY WOULD HAVE TO KIDNAP, MURDER, OR SEND INTO EXILE THE 60,000 SAN CARLOS UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, THE LARGEST AND OLDEST UNIVERSITY IN CENTRAL AMERICA."
TST2-MUC4-0099	BOGOTA, 7 JUL 89 -- COLOMBIAN OFFICIALS REPORT THAT GUERRILLAS PRESUMED TO BE MEMBERS OF THE PRO-CASTRO ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION TODAY ONCE AGAIN DYNAMITED THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS OIL PIPELINE, COLOMBIA'S MAJOR OIL PIPELINE. AN ECOPETROL SPOKESMAN SAID THAT THE EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE AT KM - 102 OF THE PIPE NEAR BENADIA IN ARAUCA INTENDANCY, IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. THIS ATTACK TAKES PLACE 25 DAYS AFTER A PREVIOUS GUERRILLA ACTION, WHICH INTERRUPTED THE PUMPING OF CRUDE THROUGH THE 780 - KM LONG PIPELINE. ON 16 JUNE, THE ELN DESTROYED THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS OIL TERMINAL ON COLOMBIA'S ATLANTIC COAST, IN WHAT IS CONSIDERED THE MOST SERIOUS ATTACK AGAINST COLOMBIA'S PETROLEUM INDUSTRY IN ITS HISTORY. SINCE THAT TIME, COLOMBIA HAS BEEN FORCED TO SUSPEND AN AVERAGE OF 180,000 OF THE 220,000 DAILY BARRELS OF CRUDE PIPED THROUGH THE COUNTRY'S LEADING PIPELINE. TODAY'S ATTACK IS THE 25TH DURING 1989, AND THE THIRD THIS WEEK, THE ECOPETROL SPOKESMAN REVEALED. THE ELN'S ATTACKS HAVE REDUCED THE NATION'S HYDROCARBON PRODUCTION THIS YEAR BY 20 PERCENT, WITH LOSSES EXCEEDING $180 MILLION. THE ELN HAS DYNAMITED THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS PIPELINE 125 TIMES SINCE JANUARY 1988, CAUSING LOSSES OF MORE THAN $450 MILLION AS A RESULT OF OIL SPILLS, HALTED PRODUCTION, THE SUSPENSION OF EXPORTS, AND ECOLOGICAL DAMAGE, THE ECOPETROL SPOKESMAN ADDED. DURING THE 25 YEARS OF ITS ARMED STRUGGLE, THE ELN -- LED BY FORMER SPANISH PRIEST MANUEL PEREZ -- HAS INTENSIFIED ITS ATTACKS AGAINST THE PETROLEUM INFRASTRUCTURE, ARGUING THAT IT PERPETRATES THESE ACTIONS "TO PREVENT THE EXPLOITATION OF COLOMBIA'S NATURAL RESOURCES."
TST2-MUC4-0100	BRASILIA , 26 MAY 89 -- THE BRAZILIAN EMBASSY IN COLOMBIA HAS CONFIRMED THE RELEASE OF REDE GLOBO JOURNALIST CARLOS MARCELO WHO WAS KIDNAPPED BY COLOMBIAN ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION GUERRILLAS. MARCELO WAS WRITING AN ARTICLE ON THE KIDNAPPING OF THE THREE BRASPETRO ENGINEERS WHEN HE WAS ABDUCTED BY THE GUERRILLAS.
TST3-MUC4-0001	SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE -- WE ARE NOT DEMANDING THAT THEY STOP THEIR OPERATIONS AS A PRECONDITION FOR NEGOTIATING. HOWEVER, IT SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT WE ARE FACING THE SAME SITUATION AS BEFORE, THEREFORE, WE HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AND WILL CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS UNTIL A CEASE-FIRE IS AGREED. IN CARACAS WE COMMITTED OURSELVES TO NEGOTIATING AND HOLDING TALKS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A CEASE-FIRE AND THE NECESSARY AGREEMENTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COUNTRY AND THE ENTIRE NATION. THAT IS THE IMPORTANT ISSUE RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING WITHOUT THAT GOAL, WITHOUT HAVING ANY COMMITMENT TO NEGOTIATE ANYTHING. HOWEVER, THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE SITUATION SHOULD REMAIN THE SAME. NOW THERE IS A NEW FACTOR, A COMMITMENT TO NEGOTIATE AND REACH AGREEMENTS ON ALL THOSE TOPICS. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE KNOW THE CONTENTS OF THE AGENDA, THAT THEY ARE FULLY AWARE OF ALL THE TOPICS TO BE DISCUSSED, AND THAT THEY KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TIMETABLE AGREEMENT FOR DISCUSSIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS. YOU JOURNALISTS CAN HELP THE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND PROBLEM. COMMANDER, WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE FMLN TO JOIN THE PROCESS? LOOK, DEADLINES ARE NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING RIGHT NOW. WHAT IS IMPORTANT NOW IS COMPLYING WITH THE AGREEMENTS TO REACH POLITICAL AGREEMENTS. THAT IS THE MAIN ASPECT OF THE GENEVA AGREEMENT. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME DEADLINES WILL NOT BE MET. IF DEADLINES ARE SET AND THE TIME FOR IMPLEMENTING THEM EXPIRES, THEN THIS IS TANTAMOUNT TO WASTING TIME. THIS THEN LEADS TO STEPS BEING DEMANDED THAT IN REALITY DEPEND ON THE POLITICAL AGREEMENTS THAT ARE REACHED AND NOT THE DEADLINES FOR REACHING THEM. THEREFORE, ACCORDING TO THE AGENDA AND THE TIMETABLE AGREED TO HERE IN CARACAS, THE ACCENT IS ON THE POLITICAL AGREEMENTS. THOSE AGREEMENTS HAVE TO DO WITH CHANGES WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES. EVERYTHING RELATED TO THE ARMED FORCES MUST BE CHANGED. EVERY FACTOR CONCERNING THE ARMED FORCES MUST BE REVIEWED FROM A CERTAIN POINT OR PERSPECTIVE. CHANGES ARE NECESSARY; CHANGES MUST BE MADE AND THOSE CHANGES MUST BE SIGNIFICANT. THESE CHANGES MUST COMPLETELY TRANSFORM THE ARMED FORCES, BEGINNING WITH ITS ROLE AND INFLUENCE IN DETERMINING THE COUNTRY'S POLICIES AND GUIDELINES. WE HAVE BEEN PRESENTING PROPOSALS IN THIS REGARD FOR SOME TIME. THE TOPIC OF DEMOCRATIZATION IS CLOSELY LINKED TO THE TOPIC OF THE ARMED FORCES, TO ITS PURGING, ITS REDUCTION, AND IN SUM, ITS END. WE BELIEVE THAT THE COUNTRY WILL NOT ALWAYS NEED THE ARMED FORCES. AS WITH ANY INSTITUTION OR HISTORICAL FACTOR, IT EMERGES, IT IS MAINTAINED FOR A CERTAIN TIME, AND THEN IT TENDS TO DISAPPEAR. THE COUNTRY MUST HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP. IT CANNOT CONTINUE ALONG THE SAME PATH BECAUSE THIS WOULD ONLY REPRESENT EXPENSES AND A HEAVY BURDEN FOR THE COUNTRY. FOR SEVERAL DECADES, THE ARMED FORCES HAVE MEANT ABSENCE OF LIBERTY, REAL SECURITY, AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF THE CIVILIAN SOCIETY TO DECIDE THE COUNTRY'S PATH. ELECTIONS HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO A MERE FORMALITY, WHERE THOSE WHO WERE NOT ELECTED RUN THE COUNTRY. THE COUNTRY IS NOW GOING THROUGH A DRAMA THAT HAS ALSO SHOCKED THE INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC, THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS. EVERYONE IS AWAITING THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS AND HOPING THAT THOSE WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CRIME WILL BE PUNISHED. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CASE OF JESUIT PRIESTS IS REALLY GRAVE; IT IS A DRAMA THAT REFLECTS THE DRAMA OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S HISTORY IN THE CURRENT CENTURY.
TST3-MUC4-0002	SAN SALVADOR, 10 JAN 90 -- THOSE ACCUSED OF THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUITS WILL HAVE A "FAIR TRIAL" AND IF FOUND GUILTY, WILL BE PUNISHED WHETHER THEY ARE CIVILIANS, MILITARY, OR INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE, SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT DR MAURICIO GUTIERREZ CASTRO SAID. THE TECHNICAL INVESTIGATION COMMISSION HAS DETERMINED THAT SOME MILITARY WERE REPORTEDLY INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF THE SIX JESUITS AND THEIR TWO MAIDS, WHICH TOOK PLACE AT DAYBREAK ON 16 NOVEMBER, AS REPORTED BY PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ON 7 JANUARY. "THE LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CAN REST ASSURED THE SALVADORAN JUDICIARY SYSTEM WILL NOT HESITATE TO ENFORCE THE LAW UPON THE AUTHORS OF THIS HORRIBLE CRIME," DR GUTIERREZ POINTED OUT. GUTIERREZ SAID HE DOES NOT KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED OR THEIR MILITARY RANKS, BECAUSE THE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE CRIMINAL ACTIONS IS STILL CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS AND HAS NOT PRESENTED ITS REPORT TO THE TRIBUNAL. HOWEVER, GENERAL PROSECUTOR DR MAURICIO EDUARDO COLORADO MAINTAINED THAT THE MILITARY SUSPECTS "ARE REGROUPED AND HAVE BEEN PUT IN CUSTODY." HOWEVER, HE DID NOT REVEAL THE NAMES OR THE MILITARY RANKS OF THE SUSPECTS. THE PROSECUTOR SAID THAT THE SCIENTIFIC TEST CONDUCTED BY THE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE CRIMINAL ACTIONS AND THE SPECIALIZED POLICE WORKING ON THIS CASE HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE CRIME COULD HAVE BEEN PERPETRATED BY ARMED FORCES MEMBERS. "THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OFFICE WILL PROCEED ACCORDING TO THE LAW AND AGAINST WHOEVER TURNS OUT TO BE GUILTY, BECAUSE IT IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE," COLORADO SAID. ASKED ABOUT THIS ISSUE, JUSTICE MINISTER DR OSCAR ALFREDO SANTAMARIA, PRESIDENT OF THE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE CRIMINAL ACTIONS SAID: "WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE MOST RECENT INFORMATION ON THIS CASE WAS ANNOUNCED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC A FEW DAYS AGO." HE REFUSED TO MAKE ANY FURTHER STATEMENTS. NEW UCA RECTOR JESUIT FRANCISCO ESTRADA ADMITTED PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS TAKEN "A STEP FORWARD" BY UNMASKING THE SUSPECTS IN THIS CRIME, "BECAUSE HIS ETHIC PRINCIPLES DO NOT TOLERATE SUCH ATROCITIES." ESTRADA SAID HE UNDERSTANDS WHY CRISTIANI, DURING HIS 7 JANUARY SPEECH, DID NOT GIVE ANY NAMES, "BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE STILL BEING CONDUCTED." MOREOVER, THERE MUST NOT ONLY BE ONE SUSPECT, BUT RATHER SEVERAL." BEFORE MEETING WITH THE REPORTERS, THE UCA RECTOR MET WITH OFFICIALS FROM SCOTLAND YARD. A FEW DAYS AGO, HE ALSO MET SPANISH, CANADIAN, AND U.S. POLICEMEN WHO, AT THE GOVERNMENT'S REQUEST, ARE ASSISTING THE SALVADORAN COMMISSION IN CHARGE OF CLARIFYING THIS CASE.

THE POLICE SAY THAT OLIVOS SILVA, A FORESTRY ENGINEER, HAS PARTICIPATED IN OTHER ATTACKS AGAINST ARMED FORCES PERSONNEL IN THE PAST. LOPEZ ALBUJAR'S MURDER HAS MADE A GREAT IMPRESSION IN PERU. ACCORDING TO POLITICAL OBSERVERS, THE INCIDENT IS BEING REGARDED AS AN INDICATION THAT THE SHINING PATH INTENDS TO CONTINUE ITS TERRORIST ATTACKS TO INTIMIDATE THE PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE UPCOMING GENERAL ELECTION ON 8 APRIL. SOME 1600 PERUVIANS WERE MURDERED DURING THE LAST QUARTER OF 1989 DUE TO THE POLITICAL VIOLENCE SURROUNDING THE 12 NOVEMBER MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.

AT 1900, A GOES TEAM SURROUNDED THE RANCH. AN AGENT MAKES SURE THE MAIN GATE IS NOT ELECTRICALLY WIRED, AND THE DECISION TO FORCIBLY ENTER THE HOUSE IS MADE. THEY ALL COVER ONE ANOTHER AS THEY TAKE THEIR POSITIONS. THESE MEN ARE PERFECTLY TRAINED FOR THIS SORT OF WORK. THESE IS A LIGHT INSIDE THE RANCH HOUSE, SO THEY ASSUME SOMEONE IS INSIDE. TENSION RISES IN VIEW OF THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ARMED CONFRONTATION. AS HE APPROACHES THE RANCH, THE COMMANDER DECIDES TO STORM IT. MOMENTS LATER, SEVERAL MEN OPEN THE DOOR WITHOUT OFFERING RESISTANCE AND SURRENDER TO THE AUTHORITIES. A PATROL ENTERS QUICKLY AND CONTROLS EVERY CORNER OF THE RANCH.

IS MANAGUA INTERESTED IN ELIMINATING ALL THE CONTRA LEADERS LIVING IN HONDURAS OR ALL PEOPLE WHO ARE LINKED TO THE COUNTERREVOLUTION? ON THE CONTRARY, WE RESPECT PEOPLES' LIVES AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN WILLING TO RECEIVE IN NICARAGUA ALL NICARAGUANS WHO WANT TO ACCEPT AMNESTY AND ALL THOSE WHO HAVE IN ONE WAY OR OTHER BEEN INVOLVED IN THE COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY CAMPAIGN. HAVE THERE BEEN ANY MORE ATTACKS AGAINST THIS EMBASSY OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF THREAT, AS OCCURRED A FEW DAYS AGO?

TST3-MUC4-0012	SAN SALVADOR, 7 FEB 89 -- THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND SAID AT THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY THAT IT DOES NOT AGREE WITH VIOLATING THE CONSTITUTION TO FAVOR THE FMLN PROPOSAL. THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY MET THIS MORNING WITH PRESIDENT DUARTE, AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES; DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL CARLOS EUGENIO VIDES CASANOVA; AND ARMED FORCES CHIEF OF STAFF COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE. THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND TRUSTS THE POLITICAL PARTIES' MATURITY AND WILL SUPPORT ANY RESOLUTION THEY APPROVE CONCERNING THE FMLN PROPOSAL, THE DEFENSE MINISTER SAID FOLLOWING A PRIVATE MEETING WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY'S DIRECTORATE BOARD AND POLITICAL COMMISSION. I TOLD THE POLITICAL PARTIES: IF YOU WANT TO GIVE THEM ADVANTAGES SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WANT YOUR CANDIDATES TO WIN, GO AHEAD AND DO IT. THEY MUST DECIDE WHETHER THEY WANT TO GIVE AWAY THE ADVANTAGES OR NOT; BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE UNJUST. A DEATH SQUAD MIGHT SAY: WE DO NOT WANT PEACE AND WE WILL SET OFF BOMBS UNTIL THE OTHERS CHANGE THEIR MINDS. THIS IS NOT THE CASE RIGHT NOW. WE WOULD BE SIMPLY ESTABLISHING A PRECEDENT. THAT IS THE MAIN DANGER. IF THE CONSTITUTION IS CHANGED AT WILL TODAY THEN IT CAN BE CHANGED AGAIN TOMORROW, AND AGAIN UNTIL THINGS ARE JUST AS THE REBELS WANT THEM. THE MEETING WAS ALSO ATTENDED BY NAPOLEON DUARTE, IN HIS ROLE AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES. I AM HERE AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES. I FULLY SUPPORT THE ARMED FORCES' DECISION CONCERNING ITS UNITY AND THE NEED TO CONSTITUTION, AND THE WARNING THAT THE ARMED FORCES WILL NOT ADOPT POSITIONS TO HINDER THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN TOO MUCH BLOODSHED AND TOO MANY LIVES LOST ALREADY. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE FMLN PROPOSAL WAS THOROUGHLY ANALYZED DURING THE MEETING, AND IT WAS AGREED THAT THE CONSTITUTION CANNOT BE VIOLATED TO FAVOR MINORITY GROUPS' POSITIONS. THE DEFENSE MINISTER ADDED: THE ARMED FORCES ARE STRONGER THAN EVER. HE ALSO REFERRED TO THE U.S. VICE PRESIDENT'S VISIT AND SAID THAT HIS VIEWS COINCIDE WITH THE ARMED FORCES' GOALS, PARTICULARLY CONCERNING HUMAN RIGHTS. THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND'S VISIT TO THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY IS CONSIDERED THE SECOND STEP TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO THE FMLN'S PROPOSAL TO THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY. THE FIRST STEP WAS TO CALL A MEETING OF THE THE POLITICAL PARTIES, WHICH WAS NOT ATTENDED BY THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY BUT SERVED AS THE BASIS FOR FUTURE MEETINGS IN A SO-CALLED NEUTRAL PLACE. THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY'S POLITICAL COMMISSION HAS NOT RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF INVITING ARCHBISHOP ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS, WHO IS INVOLVED TO SOME DEGREE IN THE REBEL PROPOSAL.
TST3-MUC4-0013	CLANDESTINE, 2 NOV 89 -- THE FMLN REPORTS TO OUR PEOPLE AND THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD THE FOLLOWING: 1. THE MASSACRE AGAINST THE SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION WAS PLANNED IN COLD BLOOD. THE SITE AND THE MOMENT WHEN THE FENASTRAS LEADERS WERE MEETING HAD BEEN SELECTED. 2. WE HAVE TRUSTWORTHY INFORMATION FROM OUR INTELLIGENCE ORGANS THAT THIS ACTION WAS ORDERED BY COLONEL PONCE, THAT CRISTIANI KNEW ABOUT IT AND APPROVED IT, AND THAT IT WAS CARRIED OUT BY COLONEL ELENA FUENTE AS THE HEAD OF THE MORBID DEATH SQUAD OF THE ARMY'S 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE IN RESPONSE TO OUR MILITARY ATTACK ON THE ARMY STAFF. THIS BEHAVIOR BY CRISTIANI SHOULD SURPRISE NO ONE. TERRORISM IS AN OLD PRACTICE OF THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE . ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO, ARENA ASSASSINS TRIED TO KILL THE PRESIDENT OF THE MORTGAGE BANK, MR MASON, FOR NOT FOLLOWING THEIR ORDERS. 3. THE PEOPLE DEMAND THE RESIGNATION OF CHIEF OF STAFF COL EMILIO PONCE BECAUSE HIS RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS CRIMINAL ACTION IS REAL. 4. THE FMLN HAS PRUDENTLY TAKEN TIME BEFORE ADOPTING A DEFINITE POSITION. THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ADOPTED AN IRRESPONSIBLE ATTITUDE AND HAVE BRAZENLY ACCUSED THE FMLN OF THE CRIMES THEY COMMIT. IN VIEW OF THIS ATTITUDE AND OF THE PEOPLE'S INDIGNATION, WE HAVE TO PREVENT OUR PRESENCE AT THE DIALOGUE FROM BEING USED TO COVER UP THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS MASSACRE AND TO ENHANCE THE MASK OF MODERATOR AND NEGOTIATOR THAT CRISTIANI HAS BEEN USING TO SECURE POLITICAL SUPPORT AND U.S. FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO EXTEND THE WAR. IN SAN JOSE, SPEAKING ON ITS VIEW OF THE WAR, THE GOVERNMENT SAID THAT IT CONSIDERS POPULAR MOVEMENTS AS SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS OF THE FMLN, AND THEREFORE, AS ENEMIES OF THE GOVERNMENT IN THE ARMED CONFLICT. WE DEMANDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATION GIVE US A LIST OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS, BUT TO NO AVAIL. THE TERRORIST ATTACKS AND MASSACRES ARE NOW YIELDING THE LISTS THAT WERE DENIED TO US AT THE DIALOGUE TABLE. EVEN BEFORE THE SAN JOSE MEETING, THE GOVERNMENT HAD GREATLY INCREASED ITS REPRESSION. SINCE THE MEETING, IT HAS INCREASED ITS DETENTIONS AND ATTACKED THE RESIDENCES OF LEADERS OF THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT AND THE UDN , UNIVERSITY, FECMASAN , AND FENASTRAS. MEANWHILE, CRISTIANI IS MAINTAINING HIS HYPOCRITICAL POSITION OF MODERATION. THE MASSACRES, DETENTIONS, AND REPRESSION OF EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS, THE REPATRIATED, UNIVERSITIES, LABOR UNIONS, PEASANT COOPERATIVES, MOTHERS' ORGANIZATIONS, AND OTHER SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION SHOW THAT THE WAR OF THE ARMED FORCES, GOVERNMENT, AND ARENA IS AIMED AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND, THEREFORE, THESE GROUPS CANNOT AND WILL NOT REMAIN IDLE. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO TAKE UP ARMS AND EXERCISE THEIR LEGITIMATE DEFENSE. THE ARMED PEOPLE'S AND REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE HEADED BY THE FMLN IS JUST, LEGITIMATE, AND NECESSARY. TWO-FACED CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, THE FMLN HAS DECIDED TO IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THE DIALOGUE OBSERVERS AND THE CHURCH, WHICH IS THE MEDIATOR, TO DEMAND THROUGH THEM GUARANTEES FOR OPPOSITION CIVIC AND LABOR GROUPS AND A REVIEW OF THE CURRENT CONDITIONS OF THE DIALOGUE, NEGOTIATION PROCESS, AND ITS PROSPECTS. MEANWHILE, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO SUSPEND OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE CARACAS MEETING. FMLN GENERAL COMMAND: COMMANDERS SALVADOR SANCHEZ CEREN, FRANCISCO JOVEL, SHAFIK JORGE HANDAL, EDUARDO SANCHO, AND JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS EL SALVADOR, 2 NOVEMBER 1989
TST3-MUC4-0014	AYACUCHO, 19 JAN 89 -- TODAY TWO PEOPLE WERE WOUNDED WHEN A BOMB EXPLODED IN SAN JUAN BAUTISTA MUNICIPALITY. OFFICIALS SAID THAT SHINING PATH MEMBERS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACK. A WOMAN WAS ALSO MURDERED TODAY IN HUAMAGUILLA IN ANOTHER APPARENT TERRORIST ATTACK. POLICE SOURCES STATED THAT THE BOMB ATTACK INVOLVING THE SHINING PATH CAUSED SERIOUS DAMAGES. PRESS SOURCES REPORTED THAT TODAY THEY RECEIVED A SHINING PATH DOCUMENT THAT HARSHLY CRITICIZES THE POLICIES OF THE ALAN GARCIA ADMINISTRATION. THE DOCUMENT ALSO ANNOUNCES THAT IT WILL SOON CALL FOR AN "ARMED STRIKE" IN THE AYACUCHO DEPARTMENT. A SIMILAR STRIKE LAST NOVEMBER, IMPOSED BY THE SHINING PATH BY TERROR, LASTED 1 WEEK. THE SAME SOURCES ALSO SAID THAT REPORTER LUIS MORALES, WHO WORKS FOR AN AYACUCHO REGIONAL ORGANIZATION, REPORTED THAT FIVE UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS ATTEMPTED TO KIDNAP HIM. HE LUCKILY ESCAPED.
TST3-MUC4-0015	SAN SALVADOR, 19 MAR 89 -- SALVADORAN REPORTER MAURICIO PINEDA, A SOUND TECHNICIAN FOR THE LOCAL CANAL DOCE TELEVISION STATION, WAS SHOT AND KILLED TODAY IN MORAZAN DEPARTMENT IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. ACCORDING TO CANAL DOCE SOURCES, PINEDA AND A TEAM FROM THE "TODAY" NEWSCAST WERE TRAVELING TO LA UNION DEPARTMENT TO COVER TODAY'S ELECTIONS. THE VEHICLE IN WHICH THE REPORTERS WERE TRAVELING WAS MACHINEGUNNED AT A CROSSROADS SOME 180 KM FROM SAN SALVADOR. THERE HAS BEEN NO OFFICIAL REPORT OF THE INCIDENT, THE SECOND OF THIS TYPE IN LESS THAN 12 HOURS, FOLLOWING THE DEATH LAST NIGHT OF ROBERTO NAVAS, A REPORTER FOR THE BRITISH AGENCY REUTER.
TST3-MUC4-0016	MANAGUA , 28 MAR 89 -- A MERCENARY GROUP FAITHFUL TO THE WARMONGERING POLICY OF FORMER SOMOZIST COLONEL ENRIQUE BERMUDEZ ATTACKED AN IFA TRUCK BELONGING TO THE INTERIOR MINISTRY AT 0900 ON 26 MARCH IN EL JICOTE, WOUNDED, KILLED AN INTERIOR MINISTRY WORKER AND WOUNDED FIVE OTHERS. THE BULLETIN ALSO REPORTED THAT BETWEEN 21 AND 25 MARCH, THE HONDURAN ARMY CARRIED OUT HARASSMENT ATTACKS ON EPS BORDER POSTS. THE REPORT ADDS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN 39 SUCH ATTACKS ON NICARAGUAN POSITIONS IN THE PAST 3 MONTHS. HONDURAN TROOPS HARASSED THE BORDER AREA OF LAS PIEDRAS, NORTH OF TEOTECACINTE, NUEVA SEGOVIA DEPARTMENT, WITH LARGE-CALIBER MACHINEGUNS ON THE MORNING OF 21 MARCH. THAT NIGHT, THE HONDURAN FORCES ATTACKED A BORDER POST IN GUAYACOLI, EAST OF TEOTECACINTE. ON 24 MARCH, HONDURAN SOLDIERS HARASSED THE BORDER REGION OF MURUPUCHI, NORTH OF TEOTECACINTE, NUEVA SEGOVIA DEPARTMENT, WITH 81-MM MORTAR FIRE AND RPG-7 ROCKETS. THE NEXT DAY, HONDURAN SOLDIERS SIMULTANEOUSLY ATTACKED THE BORDER AREAS OF LOMA LAS MESAS AND LOS ESCLAVOS HILL, BOTH SOUTHEAST OF TEOTECACINTE.
TST3-MUC4-0017	SAN SALVADOR, 14 APR 89 -- FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT URBAN COMMANDOS HAVE DENIED REPORTS THEY PARTICIPATED IN AN ATTACK ON VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT FRANCISCO MERINO'S HOME. AT 0530 THIS MORNING, UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS PLACED THREE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES AT THE MAIN ENTRANCE OF MERINO'S HOME IN THE MACHILIGUAS NEIGHBORHOOD. TWO OF THE DEVICES EXPLODED. REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE PERPETRATORS, WHO ARRIVED IN A VEHICLE, ALSO FIRED AT THE GUARDS PROTECTING MERINO'S RESIDENCE. EARLY REPORTS POINTED TO URBAN COMMANDOS AS THE PRESUMED PERPETRATORS, BUT A SPOKESMAN FOR THE MODESTO RAMIREZ CENTRAL FRONT, IN A TELEPHONE CALL, DENIED THE REPORT. ON THIS OCCASION, THE FMLN MUST EXPLAIN THAT OUR FORCES DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE ATTACK IN QUESTION. THE FMLN WARNS THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION TO CREATE CONFUSION AND PROMOTE TRUE STATE TERRORISM. THE FMLN CONDEMNS THE AGAINST OUR PEOPLE AND WARNS THAT THESE ACTIONS WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO TAKE PLACE WITHOUT THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE. THE FMLN CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY FOR ACTIONS IN WHICH IT IS DIRECTLY INVOLVED. IN THIS CASE, WE WERE NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED. THE FMLN WARNS THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS SITUATION TO PERPETRATE ATTACKS ON INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS WHICH CAN BE EASILY ATTRIBUTED TO THE FMLN. THE FMLN DESCRIBED STATEMENTS MADE BY PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AS IRRESPONSIBLE. THE PRESIDENT-ELECT IMMEDIATELY CONDEMNED THE ATTACK AND ATTRIBUTED IT TO THE URBAN COMMANDOS. AS A RESULT OF THE ATTACK, A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL WAS WOUNDED AND CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE WAS REPORTED. MERINO IS CURRENTLY OUT OF THE COUNTRY.
TST3-MUC4-0018	SAN SALVADOR, 25 MAY 89 -- GUERRILLAS ATTACKED THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE GARRISON AND THE NATIONAL POLICE STATION IN SAN SALVADOR'S SACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD TONIGHT. ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY REPORTS, AT LEAST SIX FMLN GUERRILLAS WERE KILLED DURING THE ATTACK. THREE POLICEMEN, A SOLDIER OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE, AND FOUR CIVILIANS WERE WOUNDED AND TAKEN BY THE RED CROSS TO THE LOCAL HOSPITAL. URBAN GUERRILLAS BEGAN THE ATTACK AT 1805. THEY STRUCK BOTH THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE AND THE NATIONAL POLICE STATION IN THE SACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD. THE GUERRILLAS USED 60-MM MORTARS AND RPG-18 ROCKET LAUNCHERS. THE TERRORISTS TRAVELED IN CARS. THEY DESTROYED SEVERAL POWER POLES ON 29TH STREET AND MACHINEGUNNED SEVERAL TRANSFORMERS. THE ATTACK CAME MAINLY FROM THE SOUTH, WHERE THE COHACHE ORGANIZATION IS LOCATED, AND FROM THE HONDUA CHURCH HERE. THEY ALSO ATTACKED FROM THE NORTHEAST, BUT MOST OF THE ATTACKERS CAME FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, FIRING FROM THERE AT SOME WE HAVE IN THE AREA. WE HAD REMOVED THE CORDON AROUND THE UNIVERSITY 4 OR 5 DAYS AGO, AND FIRED FROM THERE. THE WOUNDED INCLUDE AT LEAST THREE CIVILIANS, ONE OF WHOM IS IN SERIOUS CONDITION AND HAS ALREADY BEEN TAKEN BY OUR TROOPS TO THE MILITARY HOSPITAL; PERHAPS FIVE TRAFFIC POLICEMEN, ALTHOUGH THIS HAS NOT BEEN CONFIRMED; AND A SOLDIER OF THE BELLOSO BATTALION. NO DAMAGE WAS CAUSED HERE AT THE GARRISON. ONLY A FEW SHELLS HIT THE GARRISON, AND THESE WERE 60-MM MORTAR SHELLS, WHICH ARE NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH TO CAUSE DAMAGE. WE FOUND SIX . AS FOR THE RPG'S, WE FOUND ONLY ONE BEHIND THE ANTEL OFFICE . WE FOUND SIX HOLES FROM M-79 SHELLS, BUT THEY DID NOT CAUSE GREAT DAMAGE. ONE OF OUR CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES CAME OUT SLIGHTLY WOUNDED FROM THE . COLONEL, OUR COUNTRY WILL HAVE A NEW PRESIDENT IN A FEW DAYS. THE FMLN HAS CALLED A NEW TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE BEGINNING ON 31 MAY AND HAS NOW ATTACKED THE 1ST BRIGADE. BASED ON THIS EVIDENCE, DO YOU FEEL THE FMLN WILL INTENSIFY ITS MILITARY ACTIONS IN SAN SALVADOR? OF COURSE, WE ARE EXPECTING THIS. CHANNEL 12 HAS ALREADY REPORTED THAT A TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE WILL BEGIN ON 31 MAY. THEREFORE, WE BELIEVE VIGILANCE MUST BE INCREASED. WE EXPECTED THIS KIND OF ATTACK. WE HAVE ALWAYS SAID WE ARE PREPARED TO REPEL ANY TERRORIST ATTACK, AND THIS WAS A TYPICAL TERRORIST ATTACK. FROM A MILITARY STANDPOINT, I DO NOT THINK THE ATTACK WAS VERY EFFECTIVE. THE GUERRILLAS USED MORTARS BUT MOSTLY HURT CIVILIANS.
TST3-MUC4-0019	BOGOTA, 28 MAY 89 -- OIL WILL NOT BE PUMPED THROUGH THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS PIPELINE AGAIN UNTIL 30 MAY, BECAUSE IT WAS AGAIN BLOWN UP TODAY NEAR URUM MUNICIPALITY, NORTE DE SANTANDER DEPARTMENT.
TST3-MUC4-0020	LA PAZ, 30 MAY 89 -- LA PAZ DEPARTMENT POLICE AUTHORITIES HAVE DISCLOSED THAT INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE MURDER OF TWO YOUNG U.S. CITIZENS ARE BEING CONDUCTED BY A SPECIALIZED GROUP SUMMONED SPECIALLY TO CLARIFY THIS CRIME. COLONEL ARMANDO SANTAGORDA, IN A STATEMENT TO PANAMERICANA, SAID THAT HIS GROUP IS SUPPORTED BY THE CHIEF OF POLICE, WHO HAS GIVEN PRECISE INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL POLICEMEN TO COOPERATE IN THE INVESTIGATIONS. MOREOVER, HE SAID THAT HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE ARRIVAL IN THE PAST FEW HOURS OF SPECIALIZED U.S. POLICEMEN, ALLEGEDLY HERE TO COOPERATE IN THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT, SO FAR, ARE UNDER THE COMMAND AND RESPONSIBILITY OF THE BOLIVIAN POLICE FORCES. HOWEVER, SANTAGORDA ASSERTED THAT THE INSTITUTION, IN COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS, IS IN PERMANENT CONTACT WITH POLICE FORCES OF OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGH INTERPOL. HE SAID THAT REGARDING THE CASE OF THE MURDERED U.S. CITIZENS, THE POLICE ARE ALSO EXCHANGING INFORMATION BECAUSE THE INCIDENT IS OF AN INTERNATIONAL NATURE. HE SAID THAT HE BASED HIS DECLARATIONS ON THE PRELIMINARY INFORMATION OBTAINED SHORTLY AFTER THE CRIME. SANTAGORDA SAID THAT FOUR PERUVIANS SUSPECTS ARE CURRENTLY BEING INVESTIGATED, AND THEY WILL HAVE TO JUSTIFY THEIR PRESENCE IN BOLIVIA.
TST3-MUC4-0021	SAN SALVADOR, 16 JUN 89 -- SALVADORAN VICE PRESIDENT AND INTERIOR MINISTER FRANCISCO MERINO REFERRED TO THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT DOCUMENT ISSUED HOURS AGO, WHICH DENIED ANY RESPONSIBILITY IN DR JOSE ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH'S DEATH: THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT HAS BEEN ACTING ERRATICALLY FOR SOME TIME; ALL ITS ACTIONS ARE QUITE ERRATIC. THE FMLN PLANS THAT THE ARMED FORCES RECENTLY SEIZED INCLUDE A STRATEGY IN WHICH THE FMLN IS TO CREATE CONFUSION AMONG THE POPULATION BY NOT CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF ACTIONS AND CRIMES. UNDER THESE GUIDELINES, THE FMLN HAS NOT CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS ACTIONS, TO INSINUATE... TO CREATE CONFUSION OR GIVE THE IMPRESSION THIS IS A VIOLENT SITUATION THAT HAS ARISEN BETWEEN POLITICAL GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY. FORTUNATELY THERE IS EVIDENCE. THE ARMED FORCES HAVE THE DOCUMENTS THAT PROVE THAT THIS IS A STRATEGY CARRIED OUT BY TERRORIST GROUPS TO PERPETRATE THIS KIND OF ACTION AND PROVOKE A CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE POLITICAL AND DEMOCRATIC FORCES IN THE COUNTRY. OTHER VALUABLE INFORMATION HAS BEEN UNCOVERED, BUT I BELIEVE IT IS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THE PUBLIC SECURITY AUTHORITIES TO REVEAL THIS. TERRORISTS HAVE RECENTLY ISSUED DECLARATIONS REVEALING THIS STRATEGY, THEIR MODUS OPERANDI, AND THE PLANS THEY HAVE FOR THE NEAR FUTURE. THEY HAVE PLANS TO CONTINUE DEALING BLOWS AGAINST THE NEW ADMINISTRATION THROUGH ITS OFFICIALS TO FORCE CONDITIONS FOR NEGOTIATIONS IN THE NEAR FUTURE -- AS THEY DID WITH FORMER PRESIDENT DUARTE'S GOVERNMENT. VICE PRESIDENT MERINO ALSO REFERRED TO ANOTHER TOPIC IN THE NEWS, THE ANTITERRORIST LAW: WE UNDERSTAND THE BILL HAS ALREADY BEEN SENT TO THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. THERE IS FOR THE DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY, AND ANOTHER ONE THAT REFERS TO THE ANTITERRORIST LAW. THE TRUTH IS THAT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS BEEN QUITE CLEAR IN ITS POSITION, WHICH WAS STATED BY THE VICE PRESIDENCY. THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS CLEARLY STATED IT CANNOT LET THESE PEOPLE CONTINUE OPERATING WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS OR CONTROLS, VIOLATING THE LAW, DISRUPTING SOCIAL LIFE, AND DIRECTLY AFFECTING THE . THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE MUST BE PROTECTED BY EFFECTIVE LAWS SO THE PUBLIC SECURITY FORCES CAN CONTROL THE SITUATION AND SO THEIR ACTIVITIES ARE NOT INTERPRETED AS AN ABUSE OF AUTHORITY. PENAL CODE THAT CONTEMPLATES ALL THE SENTENCES FOR TERRORIST CRIMES; HOWEVER, THEY HAVE PROVED INEFFECTIVE BECAUSE THEY MAY LACK THE PROCEDURES NEEDED IN OUR CURRENT SITUATION. THOSE LAWS DATE BACK MANY DECADES; IT WAS NEVER FORESEEN THAT EL SALVADOR COULD REACH THE CURRENT DETERIORATED SITUATION, IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE KILLED AND THE CULPRITS CALMLY WALK AWAY. NEWSPAPERS SAY THAT SINCE WE ARE AT WAR, IT IS EASY FOR THEM TO KILL. IT IS RUMORED THAT THE LAW . THE PROVISIONS ALREADY EXIST; ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS HARMONIZE THEM. WE MUST FULFILL OUR OBLIGATION. THE CONSTITUTION STATED THAT EVERY SECONDARY LAW SHOULD BE HARMONIZED WITH THE CONSTITUTION. IN THIS CASE, THE PENAL CODE, THE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED TO A CERTAIN POINT, AND IT IS IMPERATIVE -- IF WE ARE GOING TO ABIDE BY THE CONSTITUTION -- TO ADAPT THEM TO OUR SITUATION. SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND NO OFFICIAL OF A FRIENDLY COUNTRY CAN INTERFERE WITH THIS. I RECENTLY TOLD SOME JOURNALISTS WHO ARE MY FRIENDS THAT VICE PRESIDENT QUAYLE'S GOAL WAS TO COME AND REAFFIRM HIS GOVERNMENT'S SUPPORT OF THE NEW SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT. HE DID IT ON THIS DATE BECAUSE ON 1 JUNE HE WAS IN CHARGE OF THE U.S. PRESIDENCY WHILE PRESIDENT BUSH WAS IN EUROPE. HIS VISIT TO EL SALVADOR WAS NOT A MERE COINCIDENCE. HE CAME TO REAFFIRM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT.
TST3-MUC4-0022	HUANCAYO, 30 JUN 89 -- THE POLICE HAVE REPORTED IN HUANCAYO, LOCATED 315 KM EAST OF LIMA, THAT ALLEGED TERRORISTS TODAY KILLED DOLORES HINOSTROZA, THE MAYOR OF MULQUI DISTRICT. HINOSTROZA, WHO WAS AT HOME, WAS SHOT FIVE TIMES. HINOSTROZA'S CHILDREN TOLD POLICE THAT FOUR HOODED INDIVIDUALS BROKE INTO THE HOUSE AND SHOT THEIR MOTHER AFTER HAVING INSULTED HER. THE KILLERS ALSO SHOUTED SLOGANS SUPPORTING THE ARMED STRUGGLE. DOLORES HINOSTROZA, 48 YEARS OLD, DID NOT BELONG TO ANY POLITICAL PARTY. SHE IS THE SECOND WOMAN MAYOR KILLED THIS WEEK BY ALLEGED COMMANDO GROUPS OF THE MAOIST SHINING PATH.
TST3-MUC4-0023	MOSCOW , 12 JUL 89 -- BLOOD IS FLOWING IN COLUMBIA, MORE ABUNDANTLY EVERY YEAR. LAST YEAR, ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL STATISTICS, THERE WERE 4,600 VICTIMS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE. ABOUT HALF OF THOSE KILLED WERE PEASANTS. AN "INTERNAL WAR," UNLEASHED BY THE OLIGARCHY MANY YEARS AGO, IS BEING WAGED AGAINST THEM. THE ACTIVISTS OF THE COALITION OF LEFT-WING PARTIES AND ORGANIZATIONS, WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE COMMUNISTS -- THE PATRIOTIC UNION -- COME NEXT, AFTER THE PEASANTS. THE PEOPLE KILLED INCLUDE JAIME PARDO LEAL, PRESIDENT OF ITS NATIONAL COORDINATION COMMITTEE, AROUND 30 DEPUTIES, AND MANY MUNICIPAL ADVISORS AND MAYORS. THE ORGANIZERS OF THE "DIRTY WAR" AND THE LEADERS OF THE "DEATH SQUADS," AND OTHER ULTRA-RIGHT-WING FORMATIONS AND THEIR HIRED KILLERS, FEEL THAT THEY CAN GO UNPUNISHED. THE RESPONSE TO THE TERROR OF THE RIGHT HAS THE ARMED STRUGGLE WHICH HAS CONTINUED FOR MANY YEARS AND LEFT-WING EXTREMISM. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, VICTIMS OF POLITICAL TERROR ALSO INCLUDED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE RULING CIRCLES AND THEIR LAW-ENFORCEMENT ORGANS, WAGING AN UNEQUAL STRUGGLE AGAINST THE POWERFUL NARCOTICS MAFIA. AS A "SHADOW ECONOMY," IT IS TRYING TO BECOME PART OF THE STATE STRUCTURE. IN THE PAST YEAR THE NARCOTICS BUSINESS HAS "ENRICHED" THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY WITH $2 BILLION AND EVEN PROPOSED THAT IT WOULD PAY OFF THE GIGANTIC FOREIGN DEBT. THE NARCOTICS MAFIA CARRIES OUT REPRISALS AGAINST ITS OPPONENTS. THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE, A MEMBER OF THE SUPREME COURT, A DIRECTOR OF THE BIGGEST NEWSPAPER ESPECTADOR, AND, A FEW DAYS AGO, ANTONIO ROLDAN BETANCUR, GOVERNOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ANTIOQUIA WERE KILLED. MANY PROSECUTORS AND JUDGES ARE LEAVING THE COUNTRY THROUGH FEAR FOR THEIR OWN LIVES AND THOSE OF THEIR RELATIVES. THE VIOLENCE IS ESCALATING AND THE IMPRESSION IS BEING FORMED THAT CERTAIN FORCES ARE TRYING TO TAKE THE ATTENTION OF THE 30 MILLION STRONG POPULATION OF COLOMBIA AWAY FROM THE URGENT RESOLUTION OF PRESSING SOCIAL PROBLEMS BY DESTABILIZING INTERNAL LIFE. SOVIET SOCIETY, IN THE NAME OF OBSERVING BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS AND CHARITY, CONSIDERS THAT OUR CONSCIENCE CANNOT BE RECONCILED WITH THE ORGY OF POLITICAL TERROR OVERWHELMING COLOMBIA. WE APPEAL TO THE PUBLIC OF THE WORLD TO RAISE THEIR VOICES AGAINST THIS EVIL IN THE NAME OF THE COMMON SOLIDARITY OF MANKIND. DRASTIC ACTIONS ARE NEEDED PARTICULARLY ON BEHALF OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS. WE CONSIDER THAT IN COLOMBIA ITSELF, DIALOGUE BETWEEN OPPOSING SIDES THAT ARE TAKING THE STAND OF PATRIOTISM AND POLITICAL REALISM IS NECESSARY. THE FRUITFULNESS OF NATIONAL DIALOGUE HAS BEEN PROVED IN PRACTICE IN THE PAST FEW YEARS BY MANY COUNTRIES. THE VITAL INTERESTS OF THE TORMENTED COLOMBIAN PEOPLE CALL FOR CIVIL PEACE.
TST3-MUC4-0024	BOGOTA, 14 JUL 89 -- FOR THE SECOND TIME, UNIDENTIFIED TERRORISTS DYNAMITED THE OIL PIPELINE BETWEEN HUILA DEPARTMENT AND BARRANCABERMEJA. MEANWHILE, ECOPETROL WORKERS ARE REPAIRING THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS PIPELINE AND CLEANING UP THE ARAUCA RIVER ALONG THE VENEZUELAN BORDER, WHERE A HUGE OIL SPILL WAS CAUSED BY ANOTHER ATTACK AGAINST THE OIL PIPELINE. AUTHORITIES CONFIRMED THAT THERE WAS A POWERFUL DYNAMITE EXPLOSION AT THE VINA-PUERTO SALGAR OIL PIPELINE, LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 30 KM FROM NATAGAIMA, IN NORTHERN HUILA DEPARTMENT, CAUSING AN UNDETERMINED AMOUNT OF CRUDE OIL TO SPILL. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME IN LESS THAN 1 MONTH THAT TERRORISTS HAVE ATTACKED THE OIL PIPELINE OPERATED BY HOUSTON OIL AND ECOPETROL. A FEW WEEKS AGO, TERRORISTS DESTROYED THE PIPELINE NEAR AIPE, WHICH CAUSED ANOTHER OIL SPILL. MEANWHILE, OPERATORS FROM THE STATE-RUN OIL COMPANY YESTERDAY BEGAN REPAIRING THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS OIL PIPELINE DYNAMITED ON THE NIGHT OF 12 JULY IN ARAUQUITA JURISDICTION, WHICH FORCED THE SUSPENSION OF OIL PUMPING FROM ARAUCA INTENDANCY'S OIL FIELDS TO THE GULF OF MORROSQUILLO. MEMBERS OF THE CONTINGENCY TEAM SUPPORTED BY PETROVEN AND THE VENEZUELAN ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES MINISTRY ARE CLEANING UP A HUGE OIL SPILL AT THE ARAUCA RIVER CAUSED BY THE 7 JULY ATTACK AGAINST THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS OIL PIPELINE. THAT ATTACK RESULTED IN A SPILL OF 13,000 BARRELS OF OIL, WHICH SEVERELY CONTAMINATED FARMING AREAS AND THE ARAUCA RIVER, TO THE POINT THAT THE POTABLE WATER SERVICE WAS TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED IN ARAUCA'S CAPITAL CITY.
TST3-MUC4-0025	SAN SALVADOR, 21 JUL 89 -- SAN SALVADOR DOMESTIC SERVICE IN SPANISH AT 0202 GMT ON 21 JULY BROADCASTS A 1 HOUR AND 11 MINUTE LIVE OR RECORDED SPEECH "TO THE NATION" BY SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ON "THE CURRENT SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY AND THE NATIONAL RECOVERY PLAN." NO DATE OR PLACE IS GIVEN. CRISTIANI BEGINS BY SAYING THAT THIS IS HIS FIRST REPORT TO THE NATION AFTER 50 DAYS AS PRESIDENT. HE NOTES THAT SINCE HE ASSUMED POWER ON 1 JUNE, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT HAS INCREASED ITS LEVEL OF VIOLENCE AND ITS NUMBER OF "INDISCRIMINATE KILLINGS." HE SAYS THAT THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS SINCE HE EXPRESSED ON 1 JUNE HIS DESIRE FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY. CRISTIANI SAYS THAT SINCE 1 JUNE HE HAS REPEATEDLY CALLED FOR A PEACE DIALOGUE, ADDING: "IN ORDER TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE OF THIS NATURE, IT MUST BE HELD IN TWO PHASES: NATURALLY, DURING THE FIRST PHASE BOTH SIDES MUST SIT DOWN TO DISCUSS THE MECHANISMS TO DEVELOP THAT DIALOGUE PROCESS, A TIMETABLE FOR THE TALKS, AND THE PLACE WHERE THE TALKS WILL BE HELD. IN OTHER WORDS, THE FIRST PHASE WILL BE TO DETERMINE HOW THE DIALOGUE PROCESS WILL TAKE PLACE. THE SECOND PHASE -- ONCE AN AGREEMENT IS REACHED ON HOW THE DIALOGUE WILL BE HELD -- IS WHAT WILL BE DISCUSSED. IN THAT REGARD, OUR GOVERNMENT HAS NOT SET ANY CONDITIONS. WE ARE WILLING TO DISCUSS ANY TOPIC, BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE MUST FIND SOLUTIONS TO MANY THINGS, AND WE ARE WILLING TO DO SO. THE ONLY CONDITION WE HAVE DEMANDED FOR THIS DIALOGUE PROCESS IS THAT, ONCE IT BEGINS, IT SHOULD NOT BE INTERRUPTED FOR ANY REASON. WE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE WANT PEACE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AND WE CANNOT HOLD TALKS FOR YEARS. ONCE WE SIT DOWN TO TALK, THAT DIALOGUE SHOULD CONTINUE UNTIL AN OVERALL SOLUTION IS FOUND TO THE CONFLICT. THAT IS OUR GOVERNMENT'S POSITION, AND WE MAINTAIN THAT POSITION BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT IS THE MOST LOGICAL ONE." TURNING TO ECONOMIC MATTERS, CRISTIANI SAYS THAT THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO SOLVE THREE PROBLEMS: THE FISCAL DEFICIT, INFLATION, AND UNEMPLOYMENT. HE SAYS THAT AS A FIRST STEP TO BEGIN THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS TO REFORM THE GOVERNMENT'S PRICING POLICY, ADDING: "WE MUST PROTECT LOW-INCOME GROUPS, AND FOR THIS REASON WE HAVE ASKED THE ECONOMY MINISTER TO BEGIN A PROCESS AIMED AT ELIMINATING PRICE CONTROLS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN ELIMINATE PRICE CONTROLS ON 230 PRODUCTS WITHOUT HAVING A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE MAJORITY OF THE PUBLIC AND THAT WE CAN KEEP STAPLE PRODUCTS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE ECONOMY MINISTRY." HE SAYS THAT PRICE CONTROLS ON STAPLES LIKE BASIC GRAINS, POWDERED MILK, FLOUR, COFFEE, SUGAR, VEGETABLE OIL AND LARD, CEMENT FOR HOUSING, AND OIL BY-PRODUCTS WILL NOT BE ELIMINATED. REGARDING THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR, CRISTIANI SAYS: "WE AGREED WITH THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR TO DEREGULATE THE DIFFERENTIAL SERVICE. TO ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE SERVING LOW-INCOME SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION WHILE CHARGING CURRENT FARES, WE WILL ALSO ALLOW THEM TO OFFER THE HIGHER-PRICED SERVICE. IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHAT KIND OF SERVICE THEY WANT TO USE: WHETHER THEY CONTINUE TO USE THE LOW-PRICED SERVICE OR A BETTER, MORE COMFORTABLE, AND FASTER SERVICE." ON ELECTRICITY RATES, CRISTIANI SAYS: "WE FEEL THAT ADJUSTMENTS TO ELECTRICITY RATES SHOULD BE APPLIED AS A RESULT OF POWER THAT IS WASTED, THAT IS, BECAUSE IT IS POWER THAT IS BEING CONSUMED BEYOND WHAT IS NEEDED TO LIVE NORMALLY. THE INCREASE IN ELECTRICITY RATES WILL BE DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE CONSUMPTION OF ENERGY IN EACH HOME. WE BELIEVE THAT WITH THIS INITIAL MEASURE, THE CEL SOLVE PROBLEMS." TURNING TO OTHER ECONOMIC MEASURES, CRISTIANI SAYS: "WE HAVE TO TAKE SHORT-TERM MEASURES TOO. IN THIS RESPECT, THE MOST LOGICAL STEP IS TO TAKE MEASURES THAT WILL AFFECT CONSUMPTION AND NOT REVENUES. THUS, WE HAVE ASKED THE FINANCE MINISTER TO TAKE MEASURES RELATED TO TAXES. HE IS TO CONSOLIDATE TAX PAYMENTS AND ONLY EXEMPT THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED BASIC BREAD BASKET ITEMS FROM THE PRESENT 5-PERCENT TAX. WE HAVE TO START ELIMINATING TAX EXEMPTIONS. ONLY EXPORTS SHOULD HAVE SOME TYPE OF MONETARY INCENTIVE BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY IS INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING ITS EXPORTS. THE REST OF THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC SECTORS SHOULD BE TAXED AT THE SAME RATE." CRISTIANI ADDS: "WE ARE GOING TO MODIFY THE SYSTEM OF PAYING INCOME TAX. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS BASED ON UNJUST REGULATIONS, ON REVENUES EARNED THE PREVIOUS YEAR THAT DO NOT REFLECT A FIRM'S PRESENT SITUATION. THUS, WE ARE GOING TO REQUEST THAT INCOME-TAX PAYMENTS BE BASED ON A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE FIRM'S PRESENT SALES; THESE ARE A TRUER AND MORE ACCURATE REFLECTION OF A FIRM'S INCOME." CRISTIANI SAYS THAT THE COUNTRY'S MONETARY POLICY MUST BE AIMED AT INCREASING SAVINGS TO PROMOTE DOMESTIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. HE SAYS THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE INTEREST RECEIVED ON SAVINGS ACCOUNTS IN THE COUNTRY'S BANKS MORE ATTRACTIVE SO THAT CAPITAL DOES NOT LEAVE THE COUNTRY. REGARDING THE COUNTRY'S CURRENCY, CRISTIANI SAYS: "WE FEEL THAT CURRENCY VALUE SHOULD BE BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF AND DEMAND FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE. WE DO NOT THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO ARBITRARILY DEVALUE AND FIX AN EXCHANGE RATE ON THE SALVADORAN COLON. EVERYTHING MUST BE BASED ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE OUR COUNTRY MAY HAVE TO PAY OUT FOR IMPORTS, BECAUSE IF WE WERE TO FIX THE RATE AT 10 TO 1 , THE CENTRAL BANKS STILL WOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH FOREIGN EXCHANGE TO COVER ALL THE IMPORTERS' DEMANDS." FURTHER DETAILS AS AVAILABLE.
TST3-MUC4-0026	SANTIAGO, 16 JUL 89 -- 1. DURING THE YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP, CHILEAN FOREIGN RELATIONS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO PROCESSES. ON THE ONE HAND, AS THE DICTATORSHIP BECAME MORE AND MORE ISOLATED, IT WAS INCREASINGLY CONDEMNED IN INTERNATIONAL FORA AND REPUDIATED BY INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION. ON THE OTHER HAND, AS MORE AND MORE COUNTRIES AND ORGANIZATIONS EXPRESSED THEIR SUPPORT FOR A FREE CHILE AND GENEROUSLY GRANTED THEIR SOLIDARITY TO OUR CAUSE, OUR ORGANIZATIONS AND DEMOCRATIC PARTIES BECAME INCREASINGLY OPEN TO THE WORLD. THUS, THEY EXPANDED THEIR HORIZONS AND CONTRIBUTED THEIR EXPERIENCES. 2. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE PARTY HAS SUBSTANTIALLY STRENGTHENED ITS INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND ENHANCED ITS VISION OF THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION. IT HAS STRENGTHENED ITS TIES WITH THE LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLES' REVOLUTIONARY AND DEMOCRATIC CAUSE, AND IT HAS FULLY IMMERSED ITSELF IN THE GREAT DEBATES OF WORLD SOCIALISM. TO THESE DEBATES WE BROUGHT OUR VIEWS ON A PROFOUNDLY RENEWED LEFTIST SOCIALISM COMMITTED TO DEMOCRACY, DEVELOPMENT, AND SOCIAL CHANGE. 3. OUR RELATIONS WITH THE PARTIES THAT MAKE UP THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST AND WITH THE SI ORGANIZATION ITSELF HAVE BEEN ENRICHED WITHIN THIS CONTEXT. THIS STRENGTHENING OF TIES HAS BEEN THE RESULT OF TWO THINGS. FIRST, IT IS BASED ON THE POSITION THAT IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS PRINCIPLES THE SI HAS UPHELD REGARDING THE CHILEAN SITUATION. IN OCTOBER 1973, A FEW DAYS AFTER THE COUP, SI CHAIRMAN WILLY BRANDT CONDEMNED THE END OF THE CHILEAN DEMOCRACY AND PRESIDENT ALLENDE'S ASSASSINATION AT THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY. AT THE TIME HE ALSO SAID THIS WAS A GREAT STEP BACKWARD FOR THOSE WHO ASPIRED TO ACHIEVE SOCIALISM THROUGH DEMOCRATIC MEANS. SINCE THEN, THE SI HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY MOBILIZED IN FAVOR OF CHILE BY MAKING THE CHILEAN CAUSE AND SALVADOR ALLENDE THE SYMBOLS OF ALL INTERNATIONAL STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY AND CHANGE. IT IS WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK OF INTEREST AND COOPERATION THAT THE VOICE OF CHILEAN SOCIALISM HAS BEEN HEARD AND OUR IDEAS AND PROPOSALS PRAISED. 4. THE SECOND REASON STEMS FROM THE PROCESS OF EXPANSION AND TRANSFORMATION EXPERIENCED BY THE SI IN THE PAST 2 DECADES. THE OVERALL PROCESS OF CHANGE THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE WORLD DURING THIS PERIOD -- THE TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION, THE GROWING INTERDEPENDENCE AMONG NATIONS, EXPANSION OF COMMUNICATIONS, GLOBAL NUCLEAR AND MILITARY PROLIFERATION, THE EMERGENCE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AS INTERNATIONAL COUNTERPARTS, THE WORSENING OF EXTREME POVERTY AND INTERNATIONAL INEQUALITIES, THE PROGRESS OF LIBERATION STRUGGLES IN THE THIRD WORLD, INTERNATIONAL AWARENESS OF THE VALUES OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS -- HAS ALSO EFFECTED MAJOR CHANGES IN THE IDEAS AND POSITIONS OF SOCIALIST PARTIES AROUND THE WORLD. IN THIS FRAMEWORK, THE SI HAS EXPANDED ITS OUTLOOK, HAS INCREASINGLY RENEWED ITS IDEAS AND, ABOVE ALL, HAS ACCEPTED PLURALISM WITHIN ITS FOLD AS WELL AS A BROAD INTERNAL DEBATE ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO PROMOTE THE CAUSE OF AN AUTONOMOUS, DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS DEBATE ACQUIRED A DEMOCRATIC, ANTIFASCIST CONTENT AS A RESULT OF THE MAJOR ROLE PLAYED BY SOCIALIST FORCES THAT HAVE ENGAGED IN A LONG ANTIFASCIST STRUGGLE.
TST3-MUC4-0027	GUATEMALA CITY, 1 AUG 89 -- DANILO BARILLAS, FORMER GUATEMALAN AMBASSADOR TO SPAIN AND LEADER OF THE RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY , WAS KILLED TODAY BY UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS IN THIS CAPITAL, THE POLICE REPORTED. ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL REPORTS, BARILLAS WAS HEADING DOWNTOWN FROM HIS HOME IN SOUTHERN GUATEMALA CITY WHEN HE WAS INTERCEPTED BY A GROUP OF UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS, WHO SHOT HIM DOWN WITH MACHINEGUN FIRE. THE POLICE SAID THAT SO FAR THE IDENTITIES OF THE ATTACKERS ARE UNKNOWN. THIS IS THE FIRST PDC LEADER KILLED SINCE PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO ASSUMED POWER IN JANUARY 1986.
TST3-MUC4-0028	TEGUCIGALPA, 5 AUG 89 -- MR PRESIDENT, ONE OF THE TOPICS TO BE DISCUSSED DEALS WITH THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT . I BELIEVE THAT AT THIS SUMMIT THE CENTRAL . HOW, MR PRESIDENT? WELL, I DO NOT KNOW. IT IS NOT EASY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. NONE OF THE PROBLEMS WILL BE EASY TO SOLVE. IS THERE A POSSIBILITY FOR DIALOGUE? YES, BUT THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WOULD ALSO HAVE TO HOLD A DIALOGUE WITH THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE. I AM THE VOZ DE NICARAGUA REPORTER. WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF THE AGREEMENT REACHED BY THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WITH THE POLITICAL PARTIES? WELL, I READ THE AGREEMENT LAST NIGHT AND BELIEVE IT TO BE A STEP FORWARD. INCIDENTALLY, I READ IT TWICE LAST NIGHT AND IT IS A VERY LONG DOCUMENT. I AM TALKING ABOUT THE AGREEMENT WITH THE PARTIES THAT ARE TRULY OPPOSITION PARTIES AND NOT THE ONE MADE WITH THE OTHER PARTIES BECAUSE THESE ARE NOT REALLY OPPOSITION PARTIES. WHAT I WANTED WAS YOUR OPINION ON THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE CONTRAS FROM HONDURAS. OH, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SMALL DOCUMENT THAT MAKES DEMANDS, DEMANDS, AND MORE DEMANDS. THIS DOCUMENT HAS NO VALUE. I MEAN THE DOCUMENT SIGNED WITH THE 21 POLITICAL PARTIES... THAT AGREEMENT IS VALUABLE BUT IT DOES NOT MENTION THE CONTRA DEMOBILIZATION. THE DOCUMENT STATES THAT THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT AND THE OPPOSITION PARTIES AGREE THAT THE ESQUIPULAS II AND COSTA DEL SOL AGREEMENTS SHOULD BE ABIDED BY. THIS IS THE DOCUMENT I READ TWICE, AND I BELIEVE IT IS QUITE SERIOUS AND A STEP FORWARD. WHAT WILL YOU DO TO GET THE MERCENARIES TO LEAVE YOUR COUNTRY? FIRST, I DO NOT USE DEROGATORY TERMS. THEY ARE NICARAGUANS WHO FOR DIFFERENT REASONS DISAGREE WITH THE SYSTEM IN NICARAGUA. THESE NICARAGUANS OPPOSE THE SYSTEM, AND FOR THIS AND OTHER REASONS THEY HAVE TAKEN UP ARMS AGAINST THE SYSTEM AND HAVE TAKEN REFUGE IN HONDURAS. I DO NOT USE THE TERM MERCENARY. I UNDERSTAND THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT USES IT AND IT IS ALL RIGHT FOR THEM TO DO SO, BUT I WILL NOT ANSWER A QUESTION THAT USES A TERM THAT I BELIEVE IS TOO DEROGATORY. THE DEMOBILIZATION PLAN HAS A VERY FIRM DEADLINE AND IS TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN 90 DAYS. DO YOU THINK... NO, NO. THE 90-DAY DEADLINE IS INCLUDED IN AN AGREEMENT SIGNED BY NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT ORTEGA WITH THREE SMALL NICARAGUAN LEFTIST PARTIES. I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS DOCUMENT IS VERY IMPORTANT. I DO BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THE AGREEMENT SIGNED BY THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT AND THE OPPOSITION PARTIES IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS BASED ON THE ESQUIPULAS II AND COSTA DEL SOL AGREEMENTS. TERRORISTS IN EL SALVADOR AND CONTRAS ARE PRESENTLY NOT ACTIVE, SO BOTH SITUATIONS -- CONTRAS AND GUERRILLAS -- ARE DIFFERENT. IS IT TRUE THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IS GOING TO PRESENT A PARALLEL PROGRAM AT THE SUMMIT? PRESIDENT CRISTIANI COMES TO THE SUMMIT AS EL SALVADOR'S LEGITIMATE PRESIDENT. HE HAS THE RIGHT TO PRESENT HIS POINTS OF VIEW. HE HAS THE RIGHT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS IN OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL AS TO ONES IN HIS OWN COUNTRY. IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THAT A DEMOBILIZATION PLAN FOR THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS WILL BE STUDIED AT THIS SUMMIT IF PRESIDENT CRISTINAI PRESENTS ONE? OF COURSE. HE HAS A RIGHT TO DO SO.
TST3-MUC4-0029	CLANDESTINE, 11 AUG 89 -- WE HAVE REPORTS FROM THE FELICIANO AMA WESTERN FRONT AND THE ANASTASIO AQUINO PARA-CENTRAL FRONT: THE FIRST REPORT INDICATES THAT AT 0745 ON 6 AUGUST, SNIPERS ATTACKED THE CIVILIAN DEFENSE POST IN THE VILLAGE OF EL AHOGADO, CANTON LA ISLA, METAPAN MUNICIPALITY.

TST3-MUC4-0030	BOGOTA, 17 AUG 89 -- TWO CRIMINAL ATTACKS, THE RESIGNATION OF THREE JUDGES, AND A 24-HOUR STRIKE BY WORKERS IN THE JUDICIAL SECTOR--THIS SUMS UP THE JUDICIAL SITUATION IN COLOMBIA OVER THE PAST 20 DAYS. THE CHAOTIC SITUATION UNLEASHED IN BOGOTA LAST NIGHT WITH THE ASSASINATION OF JUSTICE CARLOS VALENCIA BEGAN ON 28 JULY IN MEDELLIN, WHEN MOTORIZED PAID ASSASINS MURDERED THIRD PUBLIC ORDER JUDGE MARIA ELENA DIAZ. DIAZ' MURDER UNLEASHED A WAVE OF PROTESTS; 17,000 EMPEMPLOYEES FROM THE LEGAL SECTOR STAGED A STRIKE ON 1 AUGUST AND FORCED A STATEMENT FROM THE GOVERNMENT. I AM WARNING THE COUNTRY THAT THE NEXT MURDER IN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH WILL NECESSARILY RESULT IN THE COLLECTIVE RESIGNATION OF ALL THE JUDGES. PROTECTIVE MEASURES HAVE BEEN ADOPTED FOR ALL JUDGES AND WORK CONTINUES. ON 14 AUGUST, DUE TO DEATH THREATS AGAINST HIS DAUGHTER, FIRST PUBLIC ORDER JUDGE ALVARO MEDINA MORENO, WHO WAS INVESTIGATING THE WANUMEN ARMS-TRAFFICKING CASE AND THE ATTACK ON THE DAS DIRECTOR, ANNOUNCED HIS RESIGNATION. TWO DAYS LATER, ON 16 AUGUST, DUE TO DEATH THREATS THE EIGHTH PUBLIC ORDER JUDGE IN MEDELLIN, WHO WAS INVESTIGATING THE GOVERNOR OF ANTIOQUIA'S MURDER, RESIGNED. SHORTLY BEFORE JUSTICE VALENCIA'S MURDER YESTERDAY, THE SEVENTH PUBLIC ORDER JUDGE IN BOGOTA, WHO WAS INVESTIGATING THE SEARCH OF A BUILDING IN NORTHERN BOGOTA, DECIDED TO RESIGN AND LEAVE THE COUNTRY. TO CONCLUDE, THE INTIMIDATION OF JUDGES LED TO VALENCIA'S MURDER LAST NIGHT IN DOWNTOWN BOGOTA. TWO PEOPLE APPROACHED VALENCIA AND BEGAN SHOOTING AT HIM. VALENCIA'S BODYGUARDS STOOPED DOWN, THEY DID NOT HAVE TIME TO RESPOND. WHEN THEIR ATTACKERS FLED, THE BODYGUARDS CAME OUT AND BEGAN SHOOTING WILDLY. IT WAS A DANGEROUS SITUATION FOR PEOPLE IN THE AREA. STUPEFIED BY THE CRIMINAL ATTACKS ON THE JUDICIAL SECTOR, THE GOVERNMENT IS SEEKING WAYS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF INTIMIDATION. MADRID EFE IN SPANISH AT 1824 GMT ON 17 AUGUST REPORTS THAT "ANTONIO SUAREZ NINO, PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH , HAS REPORTED THAT ALL OF COLOMBIA'S JUDGES TODAY PRESENTED THEIR RESIGNATIONS BECAUSE OF THE ASSASINATION LAST NIGHT OF JUSTICE CARLOS VALENCIA GARCIA. "THE PRESIDENT OF ASONAL ANNOUNCED THE RESIGNATION EN MASSE OF THE COUNTRY'S JUDGES, SAYING THEY WILL PRESENT THEIR RESIGNATIONS AT THE COUNTRY'S HIGHER COURTS, AND HE REQUESTED A MEETING WITH COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO. "ASONAL PRESIDENT ANTONIO SUAREZ SAID THAT 'IN RESPONSE TO THIS HORRIBLE MASSACRE OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH, WE HAVE DECREED AN INDEFINITE STRIKE AND THE RESIGNATION EN MASSE OF ALL THE JUDGES, BECAUSE THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE ARE NOT IN ANY CONDITION TO CONTINUE KILLING EACH OTHER WITH IMPUNITY WHILE THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH LOOKS ON ALMOST COMPLACENTLY.'" "ASONAL ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE STATING THAT 'THIS GOVERNMENT LACKS THE AUTHENTIC POLITICAL RESOLVE TO GUARANTEE AND PROTECT THE INTEGRITY AND LIVES OF ILLUSTRIOUS FELLOW PATRIOTS SUCH AS VALENCIA.'"
TST3-MUC4-0031	HAVANA , 19 AUG 89 -- DURING THE PAST FEW DAYS, VIOLENCE IN COLOMBIA HAS TAKEN SPECTACULAR TURNS. ACCORDING TO A REPORT WHICH CITES RELIABLE SOURCES, IT SEEMS THAT THE HAND OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS IS BEHIND THE ASSASSINATIONS OF JUDGE CARLOS VALENCIA, OF THE BOGOTA , WHICH OCCURRED YESTERDAY . THE COLOMBIAN DRUG MAFIA HAS CREATED A GREAT MONEY AND CRIME EMPIRE IN COLOMBIA WITH POWERFUL RAMIFICATIONS OUTSIDE ITS BORDERS, ESPECIALLY IN THE UNITED STATES -- THE MAIN CONSUMER OF COCAINE AND OTHER DRUGS IN THE WORLD. YESTERDAY , VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ SPOKE ON THE PHONE WITH HIS COLOMBIAN COUNTERPART, VIRGILIO BARCO, AND IT IS SAID THAT THE MAIN SUBJECT OF THEIR CONVERSATION WAS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUTH DELINQUENCY AND DRUG TRAFFICKING. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THE WORDS OF VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ. WE MUST REFLECT, SAID CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, ON THE NEED FOR US, ALL VENEZUELANS, TO FACE DRUG TRAFFICKING IN VENEZUELA. WE MUST ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT DRUG TRAFFICKING IS THE ABOMINABLE CRIME OF OUR TIMES, AND THAT THERE CANNOT BE ANY HESITATION OR COMPASSION TOWARD DRUG TRAFFICKERS. THOSE ARE THE WORDS OF VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ. IN REALITY, THE DRUG TRAFFICKING DRAMA IS SERIOUSLY AFFECTING SEVERAL LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES. WE HAVE THE DRAMATIC CASE OF COLOMBIA, BUT THE SITUATION ALSO EXISTS IN VENEZUELA, BOLIVIA, PERU, WELL, IN SEVERAL LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES. NOW, THE SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM... AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT BY LATIN AMERICANS THEMSELVES AND THEIR MOST PROMINENT FIGURES, THE FINAL SOLUTION TO THE DRAMATIC DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM MUST BE BASED ON PUTTING AN END TO THE CONSUMPTION OF DRUGS. THAT IS THE MAIN STUMBLING BLOCK IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING. THE UNITED STATES IS THE MAIN CONSUMPTION CENTER OF DRUGS IN THE WORLD, AND U.S. POLICY ON DRUG TRAFFICKING IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE NEED TO PUT AN END AND ACTIVELY REPRESS THE CONSUMPTION OF DRUGS. U.S. POLICY, AND ALL THIS IS VERY WELL KNOWN IN LATIN AMERICA, IS BASED ON DESTROYING THE PLANTATIONS OF A NATIVE PLANT IN THE CONTINENT, WHICH IS COCA. PRESIDENTS, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FIGURES OF THE CONTINENT HAVE SAID THAT THE SOLUTION IS NOT BASED ON THE DESTRUCTION OF A NATIVE PLANT BUT IN ACTIVE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG CONSUMPTION. I THINK THAT THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA AND THE DRAMATIC SITUATION THAT COLOMBIA IS FACING THESE DAYS CONFIRM THAT THE POLICY FOR FIGHTING DRUG TRAFFICKING MUST BE TENACIOUS, STRONG, WITHOUT HESITATION AND COMPASSION. IT MUST ALSO BE BASED ON ENDING DRUG CONSUMPTION BY THE UNITED STATES -- THE MAIN DRUG CONSUMER OF THE WORLD -- WHICH LIVES PRECISELY FROM DRUG CONSUMPTION AND ITS BUSINESS.
TST3-MUC4-0032	BOGOTA, 23 AUG 89 -- THE ISRAELI EMBASSY IN BOGOTA TODAY CONFIRMED THAT THERE ARE ISRAELI TERRORISTS IN COLOMBIA ENGAGED IN TRAINING RIGHT-WING PARAMILITARY GROUPS THAT, ACCORDING TO INVESTIGATIONS, ARE FINANCED BY DRUG-TRAFFICKING MAFIAS. ISRAELI CHARGE D'AFFAIRS MICHEL RONEN ADMITTED THERE ARE SEVERAL ISRAELIS ENGAGED IN THAT ILLEGAL ACTIVITY, BUT WARNED THAT THEY DO SO "ON THEIR OWN AND DO NOT ACT ON BEHALF OF MY GOVERNMENT." MOREOVER, THIS OFFICIAL DENIED THAT JUBIZ HAZVUMB, CAPTURED 22 AUGUST BY COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES FOR HIS ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN THE MURDER OF SENATOR AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LUIS CARLOS GALAN, WAS AN ISRAELI CITIZEN. ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY REPORTS REVEALED BY THE PRESS, THE SUSPECT IS AN ISRAELI MERCENARY PAID BY THE MEDELLIN CARTEL -- THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL DRUG-TRAFFICKING MAFIA -- THAT APPEARS TO BE DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE MURDERS OF GALAN, A HIGH-RANKING POLICE OFFICER, AND A JUDGE LAST WEEK. REPORTS DISCLOSING THE PRESENCE OF THESE TERRORISTS IN COLOMBIA APPEARED SEVERAL MONTHS AGO WHEN TELEVISION CLIPS SHOWED A MAN GIVING INSTRUCTIONS IN HEBREW TO A RIGHT-WING PARAMILITARY SQUAD. SIMILAR CLIPS WERE BROADCAST BY THE U.S. TELEVISION NETWORK NBC, PROMPTING A COMMUNIQUE FROM JERUSALEM WHICH REQUESTED COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES AND INTERPOL TO PROVIDE ALL INFORMATION ON THE MATTER. ACORDING TO THE ISRAELI OFFICIAL, THE TERRORISTS' ACTIONS IN COLOMBIA RUN "COUNTER TO ISRAEL'S POLICIES." INVESTIGATIONS BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY -- THE STATE'S INTELLIGENCE CORPS -- DISCLOSED THE LINKS BETWEEN THE DRUG-TRAFFICKING MAFIAS AND ULTRARIGHT-WING PARAMILITARY GROUPS. ACCORDING TO DAS DIRECTOR GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ, THE DRUG-TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS, ESPECIALLY THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, SET UP SEVERAL "SCHOOLS FOR GUNMEN" IN A VAST REGION IN THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY WITH ISRAELI, BRITISH, U.S. AND WEST GERMAN TERRORIST INSTRUCTORS. MOREOVER, NBC WARNED OF THE PRESENCE OF SOUTH AFRICANS. THE PARAMILITARY SQUADS ARE ACCUSED OF HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUAL MURDERS AND MASSACRES AGAINST POLITICAL AND LABOR LEADERS, AS WELL AS PEASANTS AND PATRIOTIC UNION LEFTIST MILITANTS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. THE AUTHORITIES ARE ACCUSING THESE SQUADS' KILLERS OF BEING BEHIND THE CRIME WAVE THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING SINCE LAST WEEK, WITH THE MURDERS OF PEOPLE KNOWN FOR THEIR ACTIVITIES AGAINST COCAINE TRAFFICKING.
TST3-MUC4-0033	SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE -- THE STATION ANNOUNCER THEN LISTS WAR BULLETINS FROM GUAZAPA, FROM THE WESTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY, FROM THE METROPOLITAN AREA, AND FROM THE FRANCISCO SANCHEZ EASTERN FRONT. THE ANNOUNCER REMINDS LISTENERS THAT THESE REPORTS WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE WEEK'S EVENTS AND SAYS: "THE FIRST REPORT IS FROM THE MODESTO RAMIREZ CENTRAL FRONT, GUAZAPA AREA.

THE RADIO STATION GOES ON TO AIR A REPORT STATING THAT GUERRILLA UNITS ATTACKED A MILITARY POST WITH MORTAR FIRE, GRENADES, AND M-16 RIFLE FIRE, "KILLING ONE ENEMY AND WOUNDING ANOTHER AT 1215 ON 13 AUGUST."

THE NEXT REPORT COMING FROM CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT SAYS THAT FMLN MILITIAS SABOTAGED POWER LINES ALONG THE ROAD LINKING NUEVA CONCEPCION TO THE NORTHERN TRUNK HIGHWAY AT 1800 ON 12 AUGUST.

THE LAST REPORT SAYS THAT FMLN UNITS WOUNDED ONE OROMONTIQUE BATTALION CORPORAL AT EL TABLON, JUCUARAN JURISDICTION, AT 1630 ON 13 AUGUST.
TST3-MUC4-0034	BOGOTA, 29 AUG 89 -- GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ, CHIEF OF THE COLOMBIAN ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY , TODAY CONFIRMED FOREIGN PARTICIPATION IN THE ASSASSINATION OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN, SENATOR AND LIBERAL PARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, ON 18 AUGUST IN BOGOTA. "A PERSON OF ARAB ORIGIN IS UNDER ARREST AND SEEMS TO BE QUITE INVOLVED IN THE CRIME," MAZA MARQUEZ SAID AFTER MEETING WITH PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO TO DISCUSS NEW MEASURES TO PROTECT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.
TST3-MUC4-0035	TEL AVIV , 3 SEP 89 -- IN THE WAKE OF THE COLOMBIAN AFFAIR, SIMILAR ISRAELI ACTIVITY HAS BEEN REVEALED IN NEIGHBORING PERU AND BOLIVIA. THESE TWO COUNTRIES ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR COCAINE CROPS AND THE DRUG CARTEL'S ORGANIZED ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, EXTREMIST RIGHT-WING AND LEFT-WING ORGANIZATIONS THERE ARE ACTIVELY TRYING TO ACHIEVE POLITICAL GOALS THROUGH TERRORIST ACTIVITY. HADASHOT HAS LEARNED FROM A SOURCE WHO WAS IN PERU FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS THAT ELEMENTS LINKED TO THE DRUG GROWERS SPENT APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION ON MILITARY EQUIPMENT FROM ISRAELI ARMS DEALERS IN 1987. THE EQUIPMENT INCLUDED GALIL RIFLES, FLAK JACKETS, AMMUNITION BELTS AND AMMUNITION, VARIOUS TYPES OF GRENADES, AND COMMUNICATIONS AND NIGHT VISION EQUIPMENT. IN 1988 AND 1989, IN ADDITIONAL DEALS WORTH SOME $6 MILLION, MORTARS, SHELLS, SNIPER RIFLES, AND AMMUNITION FOR LIGHT WEAPONS WERE PURCHASED. THE ARMS WERE SENT TO PERU VIA MEXICO AND GUATEMALA. AT LEAST 3 IDF RESERVE OFFICERS WERE IN PERU FOR OVER 2 MONTHS IN EARLY 1988 TO ORGANIZE FIGHTING UNITS. THE PERUVIAN FIGHTERS WERE PRESENTED TO THE OFFICERS AS BELONGING TO RIGHT-WING POLITICAL BODIES IN THE COUNTRY, AND THE TEAM OF INSTRUCTORS INCLUDED MERCENARIES FROM THE NETHERLANDS AND ENGLAND. THE TEAM OF INSTRUCTORS WAS MADE UP OF SOME 10 PEOPLE, SOME OF WHOM WERE RECRUITED THROUGH AN ISRAELI-NETHERLANDER ARMS DEALER WHO LIVES IN AMSTERDAM. THE NETHERLANDS MEDIA IS CONDUCTING A WIDE-RANGING INVESTIGATION INTO THE SUBJECT DESPITE THE SURPRISING LACK OF INTEREST BY THE NETHERLANDS AUTHORITIES IN THE AFFAIR. AT THE SAME TIME, ISRAELIS IN NEIGHBORING BOLIVIA ACTED AS INSTRUCTORS IN A COURSE ON SAFEGUARDING BUSINESSMEN, GUERRILLA WARFARE, AND REGIONAL DEFENSE. THESE ISRAELIS REACHED BOLIVIA IN THE WAKE OF AN ARMS CONSIGNMENT WORTH SOME $12 MILLION, WHICH ARRIVED IN PERU VIA A THIRD PARTY, WHICH PURCHASED IT IN AN AFRICAN COUNTRY, WHICH IN TURN HAD RECEIVED IT FROM ISRAEL. FOLLOWING THE REPORTS ON DEALS BY ISRAELIS ABROAD, THE INCOME TAX INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION HAS BEGUN AN INQUIRY INTO TAX PAYMENTS ON ISRAELI ARMS DEALS AND TRAINING ABROAD. IN THE PAST 5 YEARS, THE SCOPE OF COMMISSIONS PAID TO ARMS DEALERS IS ESTIMATED AT $1 BILLION. AT LEAST HALF OF IT WENT TO BIG DEALERS, SUCH AS SHA'UL EISENBERG, MARCUS KATZ, PESAH BEN-OR, ISRACES, AND OTHERS. THEY ARE NOT UNDER SUSPICION OF TRYING TO CHEAT OR HIDE INFORMATION FROM THE TAX AUTHORITIES.
TST3-MUC4-0036	BOGOTA, 4 SEP 89 -- THIS STATION HAS LEARNED THAT THREE PERSONS HAVE BEEN KILLED AT THE JOSE MARIA CORDOBA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, IN THE TOWN OF RIO NEGRO, ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT. ONE OF THE PERSONS KILLED WAS WEARING A MILITARY UNIFORM, BUT WE STILL DO NOT KNOW IF HE WAS IN DISGUISE OR IF HE BELONGED TO THE SECURITY CORPS. ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY REPORTS FROM THE ANTIOQUIA POLICE, THIS WAS AN ATTACK ON THE INSTALLATIONS OF THE JOSE MARIA CORDOBA AIRPORT. I REPEAT: THIS IS A PRELIMINARY REPORT BY THE ANTIOQUIA POLICE. RIGHT NOW, TOP OFFICIALS AND ANTIOQUIA POLICE CHIEFS ARE ON THEIR WAY TO THE AIRPORT. THE AIRPORT HAS BEEN SEALED OFF, AND PEOPLE ARE TRAPPED INSIDE OFFICES THERE. NO ONE IS ALLOWED NEAR THE SCENE OF THE VIOLENT SHOOTING THAT TOOK PLACE THERE JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO. A SEARCH IS UNDER WAY THROUGHOUT RIO NEGRO'S SAN NICOLAS VALLEY, WHERE THE AIRPORT IS LOCATED, FOR THE PERPETRATORS OF THIS ATTACK, WHO ARE NOW BELIEVED TO BE DRIVING TWO YELLOW RENAULTS AND ARE BEING PURSUED BY THE POLICE. I REPEAT: SO FAR, WE KNOW THAT THREE PERSONS HAVE BEEN KILLED INSIDE THE AIRPORT. ONE OF THOSE KILLED WAS WEARING A MILITARY UNIFORM. THE ANTIOQUIA POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT THIS WAS AN ATTACK ON THE AIRPORT INSTALLATIONS. WE STILL HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO LEARN IF THE ATTACK WAS TARGETED AGAINST ANYONE IN PARTICULAR.
TST3-MUC4-0037	MEDELLIN, 4 SEP 89 -- TWO PERSONS WERE INJURED IN DYNAMITE ATTACKS PERPETRATED THIS EVENING AGAINST TWO BANK BRANCHES IN THIS NORTHWESTERN COLOMBIAN CITY. THE FIRST POLICE REPORTS INDICATE THAT A BOMB EXPLODED IN FRONT OF THE STATE-OWNED AGRARIAN BOARD IN THE SUBURBS OF MANRIQUE, AND ANOTHER AT THE AGRARIAN BOARD BRANCH IN THE SECTOR OF ARANJUEZ. ONE PERSON WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED IN EACH OF THE TERRORIST ATTACKS, BUT NO DEATHS WERE REPORTED. THE DEVICE WHICH EXPLODED IN MANRIQUE DESTROYED THE BANK BUILDING AND A BUS THAT WAS PARKED IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING, AND CAUSED CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE IN SEVERAL STORES NEARBY. THE EXPLOSION IN THE OTHER BRANCH WAS OF A LESSER MAGNITUDE, AND IT BROKE WINDOWS AND CAUSED DAMAGE INSIDE THE OFFICES. THE SCANT POLICE INFORMATION SAID THAT THE DEVICES WERE APPARENTLY LEFT IN FRONT OF THE TWO BANK BRANCHES MINUTES BEFORE THE CURFEW BEGAN FOR THE 6TH CONSECUTIVE DAY--PRECISELY TO COUNTER THE WAVE OF TERRORISM CAUSED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS. THESE REPRESENT THE SECOND AND THIRD DYNAMITE ATTACKS IN MEDELLIN THIS EVENING. THE PREVIOUS ONE TOOK PLACE 2 HOURS EARLIER AND BLEW UP A POLICE POST, BUT FAILED TO INJURE ITS FIVE OCCUPANTS.
TST3-MUC4-0038	BOGOTA, 13 SEP 89 -- DAS DIRECTOR MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ CONFIRMED TODAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES HAD KNOWN FOR OVER 1 YEAR THAT THERE WERE MERCENARIES IN OUR COUNTRY, BUT POLICE AUTHORITIES APPARENTLY PREVENTED AN INVESTIGATION THAT HAD BEEN ORDERED, AS A MATTER OF FACT, BY A FEMALE JUDGE. OUR REPORTER HERNANDO CORRALES HAS THE DETAILS: IF THE AUTHORITIES IN CHARGE OF AN OPERATION NEAR PUERTO BOYACA ON 18 JULY LAST YEAR HAD NOT SABOTAGED IT, THE FOREIGN INSTRUCTORS AT THE SERVICE OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL WOULD NOW BE JAIL. ON THAT DATE, MARTA LUCIA GONZALEZ, SECOND JUDGE OF PUBLIC ORDER, WROTE A FILE NOTE SAYING THAT THE JUDICIAL INSPECTION WAS UNJUSTLY TORPEDOED WITH THE ARGUMENT THAT NOTHING HAD BEEN FOUND AND THAT THIS ARGUMENT WAS SENSELESS AND ILLOGICAL SINCE ABSOLUTELY NO ONE OTHER THAN THE UNDERSIGNED JUDGE COULD DECIDE IF HE OR SHE HAD ANYTHING TO INSPECT, OR IF HE OR SHE SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT CONDUCT THE JUDICIAL PROCEEDING. THE DOCUMENT, WHICH IS CONTAINED IN THE DOSSIER ON THE MASSACRE IN LA HONDURA AND LA NEGRA, URABA REGION, SAYS THAT SHE WAS LEFT 2 DAYS INSIDE A PLANE AT THE AIRPORT OF THE TEXAS PETROLEUM COMPANY IN PUERTO BOYACA AND THAT THE POLICE AUTHORITIES ACCOMPANYING HER FAILED TO EXPLAIN TO HER WHY THEY HAD NOT TAKEN ANY ACTION. IN FACT, SHE AND SEVERAL DAS INSPECTORS ENCOUNTERED SOME OBSTACLES. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WAS INFORMED OF THESE OBSTACLES IN ORDER FOR IT TO MAKE AN INVESTIGATION. I THINK THAT WHEN SHE AND THE DAS PERSONNEL WERE PREPARING TO GO TO PUERTO BOYACA IT WAS ALREADY KNOWN THAT THESE PEOPLE WOULD BE PRESENT THERE FOR THESE PROCEEDINGS AND THIS WAS QUITE WORRISOME. AS IS KNOWN, JUDGE GONZALEZ HAD TO LEAVE COLOMBIA BECAUSE HER LIFE WAS THREATENED, AND HER FATHER, FORMER BOYACA GOVERNOR ALVARO GONZALEZ SANTANA, WAS SUBSEQUENTLY MURDERED. MOREOVER, GEN MAZA MARQUEZ SAID FURTHER THAT THE FACT THAT A PAYMENT IS BEING OFFERED FOR THE CAPTURE OF PABLO ESCOBAR AND GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA DOES NOT MEAN THAT OTHER PERSONS ACCUSED OF BEING CAPOS OF THE MAFIA ARE NOT BEING SOUGHT TOO. WE ARE TAKING ACTION THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF THE COUNTRY. WE ARE NOT SHOWING ANY SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS BECAUSE WE INTEND TO ACT INDISCRIMINATELY. WHAT WE WANT IS TO FIGHT A SCOURGE THAT HAS GREATLY HARMED ALL COLOMBIANS. THE DAS DIRECTOR SAID THAT IF ANYONE BEING HELD IN CONNECTION WITH THE INVESTIGATION OF THE KILLING OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN IS RELEASED, THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOT PROCEEDING WELL.
TST3-MUC4-0039	GUATEMALA CITY, 18 SEP 89 -- THE TOPIC ABOUT VIOLENCE AND THE PROCEDURES ADOPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO COUNTER IT WERE DISCUSSED ON 18 SEPTEMBER DURING THE INAUGURATION OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC INTERNATIONAL WORLD ASSEMBLY. GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO GAVE THE INAUGURATION SPEECH AND REVEALED THE PLANS TO DESTABILIZE THE COUNTRY. THERE ARE SOME STUBBORN PEOPLE WHO REFUSE TO ACCEPT THAT PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE PEACEFULLY AND FREELY. THERE ARE EVEN SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE USING VIOLENCE TO IMPOSE THEIR IDEAS; THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COUNTER THE GUATEMALAN PEOPLE'S IDEAS WITH CONFRONTATION AND POLARIZATION. THOSE PERSONS ARE PREPARING RIGHT NOW A PLOT AGAINST GUATEMALA'S DEMOCRACY. IT IS PERHAPS THE MOST CRUEL, HARSH, AND AUDACIOUS PLOT EVER PREPARED IN THE NATION'S 4 YEARS OF DEMOCRATIC HISTORY, BECAUSE -- AND I WANT YOU TO CAREFULLY LISTEN TO THIS -- THEY HAVE DECIDED TO KILL PROMINENT POLITICAL AND LABOR LEADERS SO THAT THE PEOPLE BLAME THE GOVERNMENT -- REMEMBERING THE TRAGEDIES WHICH OCCURRED IN THE PAST AND THE ILLEGITIMATE GOVERNMENTS WHICH DECIDED TO KEEP, WITH DEATH AND REPRESSION, THE PRIVILEGES THAT THEY HAD NOT EARNED. THESE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO CREATE A RIFT BETWEEN THE GUATEMALAN PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT; THEY WANT US TO FALL INTO A TRAP. PRESIDENT CEREZO ADDRESSED THE DELEGATES OF 54 COUNTRIES WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC INTERNATIONAL WORLD ASSEMBLY, ASSERTING THAT THE EFFORTS TO BE EXERTED BY HIS GOVERNMENT TO COUNTER TERRORISM SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. HE SAID NO ONE SHOULD CONDEMN HIS GOVERNMENT WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE SITUATION. PRESIDENT CEREZO ALSO PLEDGED TO USE EVERY AVAILABLE MEANS TO LOCATE THOSE WHO PERPETRATE ACTS OF TERRORISM. -- ...CRIMINALS AND WE ARE ALREADY LOOKING FOR THEM! AND WE WILL PUNISH THEM ACCORDING TO THE LAW, TO GIVE BACK TO THE GUATEMALAN PEOPLE THE LIBERTY THAT THEY HAVE ENJOYED FOR 3 AND 1/2 YEARS -- BECAUSE IT IS THE RESULT OF MANY YEARS OF SACRIFICE!
TST3-MUC4-0040	BOGOTA, 21 SEP 89 -- AUTHORITIES HAVE OFFICIALLY REPORTED THAT SEVERAL BANK OFFICES WERE ADVERSELY AFFECTED TONIGHT IN THE CHAPINERO NEIGHBORHOOD OF NORTHERN BOGOTA WHEN TWO BOMBS EXPLODED, CAUSING MINOR INJURIES TO A CHILD AND A SECURITY GUARD. THE FIRST BOMB EXPLODED BY THE DOOR OF A BANCO DE OCCIDENTE BRANCH AT 2115 LOCAL TIME , AND THE SHOCK WAVE DAMAGED OTHER NEARBY BANKS. FOLLOWING THE EXPLOSION, A 9-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO LIVES NEAR THE BANCO DE OCCIDENTE WAS WOUNDED BY PIECES OF GLASS, SAID HIS RELATIVES, WHO TOOK HIM TO THE "MARLY" CLINIC NEAR THE AREA. AT THE SAME TIME, ANOTHER BOMB EXPLODED AT A BANCO POPULAR BRANCH, TWO BLOCKS AWAY FROM WHERE THE FIRST EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE, POLICE SAID. OTHER BANKS AND SHOPS WERE DAMAGED BY THE SECOND EXPLOSION, AND THE SECURITY GUARD AT THE BANCO POPULAR WAS ALSO INJURED BY PIECES OF FLYING GLASS, THE AUTHORITIES SAID. ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY REPORTS, TWO MEN PLACED THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES AND LEFT THE SCENE ON FOOT. BOTH OF THESE ATTACKS TONIGHT, ATTRIBUTED TO THE DRUG TRAFFICKING CARTELS, TOOK PLACE AFTER 10 BOMBS EXPLODED EARLY THIS MORNING IN THE TEUSAQUILLO AREA IN DOWNTOWN BOGOTA. THE BOMBS WERE PLACED IN NINE POLITICAL OFFICES OF THE LIBERAL AND SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE PARTIES AND IN ANOTHER BANK OFFICE.
TST3-MUC4-0041	BOGOTA, 28 SEP 89 -- I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH GENERAL OCTAVIO VARGAS SILVA, NATIONAL POLICE OPERATIONAL COMMANDER AND INSPECTOR. GEN VARGAS HAS SAID THAT THE TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED IN THE ATTACK THAT TOOK PLACE AT SUBA MUNICIPALITY LAST NIGHT HAVE NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED. TWO PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND FIVE OTHERS WERE WOUNDED AS A RESULT OF THE ATTACK. THE TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED ARE YET TO BE IDENTIFIED. THOSE WOUNDED INCLUDE THREE EMPLOYEES OF THE GAS STATION WHERE THE CAR BOMB WENT OFF AND TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE WALKING BY THE GAS STATION AT THE MOMENT OF THE EXPLOSION. PRELIMINARY REPORTS HAVE ESTIMATED THAT THE EXPLOSION CAUSED 70 MILLION PESOS IN LOSSES. GENERAL, APPROXIMATELY HOW MANY KILOGRAMS OF EXPLOSIVES WERE IN THE CAR BOMB? APPARENTLY IT CONTAINED 60 KG OF DYNAMITE. THE DYNAMITE WAS PLACED INSIDE AN OLD STATION WAGON. SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED TO THE PEOPLE WHO WERE INSIDE THE VEHICLE AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION -- THE TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED. APPARENTLY THE CAR BOMB WENT OFF BY ACCIDENT. IT WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE GONE OFF AT THAT GAS STATION. HAVE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED BEEN IDENTIFIED? NO, NOT YET. WE ARE TRYING TO IDENTIFY THEM NOW. ARE THERE SPECIAL SECURITY MEASURES TO COUNTER THIS WAVE OF TERRORISM? YES, OF COURSE. WE ARE CARRYING OUT A SERIES OF JOINT ACTIONS WITH THE BOGOTA POLICE DEPARTMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY PERSONNEL TO NEUTRALIZE TERRORIST ACTIONS. WE ARE CARRYING OUT THOSE ACTIONS IN AREAS WE CONSIDER CRITICAL OR VULNERABLE AND IN OTHER AREAS WHERE WE ARE COUNTERACTING AND NEUTRALIZING TERRORIST ACTIONS, AS I TOLD YOU. ARE THERE SECRET AGENTS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CITY? YES, WE HAVE UNIFORMED AND CIVILIAN PERSONNEL GUARDING THE CITY RIGHT NOW. WE ALSO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE BOGOTA POLICE DEPARTMENT, OF DIJIN , AND OF CIJIN . THEY ARE COOPERATING WITH US. THEY ARE GUARDING AREAS WE CONSIDER CRITICAL OR PLACES THAT COULD BE TARGETS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS. WHAT OTHER MEASURES HAVE YOU ADOPTED ALONG WITH THE 13TH INFANTRY BRIGADE AND THE BOGOTA MAYOR? WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF MEASURES, SUCH AS INCREASING PERSONNEL ON THE STREETS AND HUMAN AND MATERIAL RESOURCES. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED CHEKCKPOINTS IN AREAS WE CONSIDER CRITICAL AND ARE CARRYING OUT A NUMBER OF OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES THAT WILL HELP US LOCATE THESE CRIMINALS.
TST3-MUC4-0042	SAN SALVADOR, 28 SEP 89 -- COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, SAID TODAY THAT THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED ON 26 SEPTEMBER BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN, WAS A MISTAKEN STEP TAKEN BY THE REBELS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE DIALOGUE PROCESS WITH THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH WAS RESUMED IN MEXICO. COL PONCE SAID THAT WITH THIS ATTITUDE THE REBELS ARE NOT SHOWING A REAL DESIRE FOR PEACE, AND HE DESCRIBED IT AS A PROPAGANDISTIC ACTION. TODAY, DURING HIS TOUR OF VARIOUS AREAS OF CONFLICT, COL PONCE SAID THAT RECENT FMLN ATTACKS ON VARIOUS MILITARY POSITIONS AS PART OF ITS LATEST CAMPAIGN FOLLOWING THE UNILATERAL TRUCE WAS A SERIOUS MISTAKE ON THE PART OF THE REBEL COMMANDERS, AS THEY HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT IN THE MIDST OF A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE REBELS AND THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS CONTINUOUS. THAT SHOWS THERE ARE, ON THE ONE HAND, THE PROPOSALS AND WHAT THE TERRORIST LEADERS CALL THEIR DESIRE FOR PEACE, AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE REAL ACTIONS. I THINK THAT THE CAMPAIGN THE FMLN HAS MOUNTED NATIONWIDE WAS A BAD STEP, BECAUSE IT DOES NOT SHOW A REAL AND SINCERE DESIRE TO SEEK PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY. COLONEL PONCE ADDED THAT THE REQUEST FOR REDUCING THE NUMBER OF TROOPS AS STATED IN THE GUERRILLA PROPOSAL IS A POLITICAL MOVE. HE PLAYED DOWN THE LATEST REBEL OFFER PRESENTED TO THE GOVERNMENT IN MEXICO. THE PROPOSAL WAS AIMED AT IMPROVING THE FMLN'S IMAGE ABROAD, WHICH HAD DETERIORATED IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. THE PROPOSAL CAN BE DISCUSSED; HOWEVER, WE IN THE ARMED FORCES ARE NOT THE ONES WHO WILL DISCUSS IT OR WHO WILL DECIDE WHETHER IT CAN OR CANNOT BE ACCEPTED. IT IS A POLITICAL DECISION, AND THE ARMED FORCES WILL ACCEPT THE DECISION MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT. THE MILITARY COMMANDERS ARE NOT THE ONES WHO MUST DECIDE ON THE NUMBER OF TROOPS THE INSTITUTION SHOULD HAVE. THIS IS A DECISION TO BE MADE BY THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY, BASED ON THE REQUIREMENTS AND THREATS THE COUNTRY MAY BE FACING. COLONEL PONCE VISITED THE POSITIONS OF THE ARMY'S BELLOSO AND ATLACATL ELITE BATTALIONS IN THE TOWNS OF PERQUIN IN MORAZAN DEPARTMENT AND LA LAGUNA IN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT, NEAR THE HONDURAN BORDER, WHERE FIGHTING IS TAKING PLACE. DURING THIS MILITARY TOUR, COL PONCE SAID THAT IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE IS NO LIBERATED OR PERMANENTLY OCCUPIED TERRITORY IN EL SALVADOR. HOWEVER, THE REBELS CLAIM THEY CONTROL THAT AREA OF INTENSE CONFLICT WHERE THE WAR HAS LEFT ITS INDELIBLE MARK.
TST3-MUC4-0043	NO CITY , 29 SEP 89 -- SUCH AN UNCONDITIONAL CEASE-FIRE DOES NOT CORRESPOND TO THE SPIRIT OF THE ESQUIPULAS AND TELA AGREEMENTS AND THE ACCORDS THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN SIGNED IN MEXICO IN WHICH THE SIDES CLEARLY AGREED TO FIND SOLUTIONS IN THE AREA AND IN EL SALVADOR. ASKING FOR AN END TO THE WAR AND NEGOTIATIONS IS LIKE DEMANDING THAT THE SITUATION BE CHANGED WITHOUT HAVING WON THE WAR. IN ADDITION TO BEING UNREALISTIC, THIS IS A FORMULA FOR NOT NEGOTIATING AND CONTINUING THE WAR. IN THE ESQUIPULAS II DOCUMENTS, THE GOVERNMENTS URGE THE SIDES TO AGREE TO A CEASE-FIRE. THE TELA ACCORDS ALSO APPEAL TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE FMLN IN THE SPIRIT OF THE ESQUIPULAS II ACCORDS. THIS PARTICULAR AGREEMENT LINKS THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES TO DEMOCRATIZATION, SOCIAL JUSTICE, AND SELF-DETERMINATION AS A HARMONIOUS, INDIVISIBLE WHOLE. THIS CONCEPT IS SUPPORTED BY THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL IN ITS RESOLUTION 637 OF 27 JULY 1989. IN ADDITION, THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THE MEXICAN ACCORD READS AS FOLLOWS: THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN WILL TALK IN AN EFFORT TO REACH AN UNDERSTANDING THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS TO CONCLUDE THE ARMED CONFLICT THROUGH POLITICAL MEANS AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE. THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN WILL FOSTER THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIZATION AND REUNITE SALVADORAN SOCIETY. THE DIALOGUE IS MEANT TO SERVE AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR REACHING AN AGREEMENT ON CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES. THE AGREEMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT SIGNED IN MEXICO SAYS NOTHING OF TALKING ABOUT OR NEGOTIATING THE FMLN'S DEMOBILIZATION BUT MENTIONS NEGOTIATIONS TO ENCOURAGE DEMOCRATIZATION TO AGREE ON THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES. BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, CRISTIANI IS CLOSING THE DOOR TO DEMOCRATIZATION. THIS, PLUS HIS REFUSAL TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE FMLN, MAKES HIM GUILTY OF NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE COMMITMENTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT MADE AT ESQUIPULAS. 3. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMMITMENT WE MADE IN MEXICO AND WITH THE REGIONAL ACCORDS, WE REITERATE OUR FULL WILLINGNESS TO AGREE WITH THE GOVERNMENT ON A CEASE-FIRE AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE AND TO ATTEND THE UPCOMING NEGOTIATION MEETING IN COSTA RICA. FOR THIS MEETING, WE HAVE INCLUDED IN OUR PEACE PROPOSAL AN AGREEMENT ON A CEASE-FIRE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING POINTS: REFORMS TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM; CESSATION OF REPRESSION; TRIAL OF BOTH THOSE GUILTY OF THE MURDER OF MONSIGNOR ARNULFO ROMERO AND THOSE FOUND TO BE MEMBERS OF THE DEATH SQUADS; ENFORCEMENT OF THE 1980 ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REFORMS; AND SUSPENSION OF THE ECONOMIC MEASURES THAT EXACERBATE THE CRISIS AND THE WAR; PURGE OF THE ARMY; CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS; HOLDING THE 1991 ELECTIONS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE; MINIMUM OPERATIONAL GUARANTEES TO ESTABLISH GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS FOR THE FORCES TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE CEASE-FIRE. AFTER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE PRESENCE OF THE UN AND OAS SECRETARY GENERALS' REPRESENTATIVES, WHO WILL SERVE AS WITNESSES AT THE DIALOGUE TABLE, CRISTIANI AGREED TO INVITE THEM TO THE COSTA RICA MEETING. WE HOPE HE KEEPS HIS WORD BECAUSE THIS WILL LEND SERIOUSNESS TO THE PROCESS AND GUARANTEE THE NEGOTIATIONS INITIATED IN MEXICO. SIGNED THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND
TST3-MUC4-0044	BUENOS AIRES, 5 OCT 89 -- POLICE HAVE CONFIRMED THAT A BOMB EXPLODED EARLY THIS MORNING IN FRONT OF THE OFFICES THAT FORMER PRESIDENT RAUL ALFONSIN HAS IN THIS CITY. THE EXPLOSION BROKE THE WINDOWS OF NEIGHBORING BUILDINGS AND A WOMAN WAS WOUNDED SLIGHTLY IN AN ARM. THE ATTACK OCCURRED AT 0320 IN FRONT OF THE RICARDO ROJAS CULTURAL CENTER, LOCATED AT 132 AYACUCHO STREET, WHERE THE FORMER PRESIDENT HAS OFFICES FOR HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITIES. THE EXPLOSION WOUNDED THE ARM OF BEATRIZ IERO, DAMAGED THE DOORS AND WALLS OF THE OFFICES, AND BROKE THE WINDOWS OF NEIGHBORING BUILDINGS. PERSONNEL FROM THE 5TH POLICE PRECINCT ARE INVESTIGATING.
TST3-MUC4-0045	TRUJILLO, 9 OCT 89 -- A PERUVIAN DIPLOMATIC SOURCE SAID TODAY THAT JUDGING BY PERU'S STANCE ON THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SITUATION IN THE ISTHMUS, THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT "IS UNCOMFORTABLE" WITH THE PRESENCE OF THE PANAMANIAN AMBASSADOR IN LIMA. THE SOURCE, WHO REQUESTED ANONYMITY, ALSO SAID THAT THE PRESENCE OF PANAMANIAN AMBASSADOR BERTRAN SHERR IT "CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD AS BEING OF COMMERCIAL AND PERSONAL INTEREST." THE SOURCE TOLD EFE THAT THE EVENTUAL REMOVAL OF PANAMA FROM THE GROUP OF EIGHT AND ITS REPLACEMENT BY A NEW MEMBER WILL BE DECIDED THIS WEDNESDAY IN ICA DURING THE SUMMIT OF THE PRESIDENTS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, COLOMBIA, MEXICO, PERU, URUGUAY, AND VENEZUELA. PANAMA'S ROLE IN THE GROUP OF EIGHT HAS BEEN SUSPENDED BECAUSE OF THAT COUNTRY'S CURRENT POLITICAL SITUATION. THE SAME SOURCE DISMISSED THE IDEA THAT PERU MAY BE PLANNING TO BREAK DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH PANAMA BECAUSE THIS WOULD AFFECT PERU'S LINKS WITH THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE AND "THIS IS NOT THE POSITION OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT MEMBER COUNTRIES." PANAMA HAS HAD AN AMBASSADOR IN PERU FOR 40 YEARS, BUT ONLY FOR "PERSONAL REASONS". IN THE PRIVATE DIALOGUE WITH EFE, THE SOURCE SAID THAT "THE PANAMANIAN AMBASSADOR SEEMINGLY DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE MESSAGES SENT BY THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT THROUGH ITS RECENT ACTIONS." IN EARLY SEPTEMBER THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT REMOVED ITS AMBASSADOR TO PANAMA, MR MARIO CASTRO ARENAS, FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD AND DOWNGRADED RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES TO THE LEVEL OF CHARGE D'AFFAIRES. PERU DID THIS AFTER ANNOUNCING THAT IT WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE NEW PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT HEADED BY FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ. ASKED IF THE PANAMANIAN DIPLOMAT WOULD BE INVITED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY, THE SOURCE SAID THAT "THIS HAS NOT BEEN CONSIDERED BECAUSE THAT WOULD IMPLY BREAKING RELATIONS WITH PANAMA, AND PERU DOES NOT WANT TO GO THAT FAR." IN COMMENTS TO A TELEVISION REPORTER LAST SUNDAY IN LIMA, FOREIGN MINISTER GUILLERMO LARCO COX SAID THAT PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA WILL PROPOSE THE DEFINITIVE EXPULSION OF PANAMA FROM THE GROUP OF EIGHT. THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, MEXICO, URUGUAY, AND PERU BEGAN A 2-DAY MEETING IN TRUJILLO TODAY AND THEIR AGENDA INCLUDES THE SITUATION IN PANAMA, THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, TERRORISM, THE FOREIGN DEBT, AND THE INTEGRATION PROCESS. TRUJILLO, 550 KILOMETERS NORTH OF LIMA, IS NORMALLY A QUIET AREA, BUT IT NOW GIVES THE IMPRESSION OF BEING A MILITARIZED CITY. THIS MILITARY PRESENCE IS AIMED AT DETERRING SABOTAGE AND ATTACKS BY TERRORIST GROUPS. AT LEAST 5,000 POLICEMEN AND SOLDIERS ARE GUARDING ALL ENTRANCES TO THE CITY. THERE IS EVEN HEAVIER SECURITY AT THE PLAZA DE ARMAS ZONE, WHERE THE FOREIGN MINISTERS WILL MEET. NO VEHICLES OR PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED IN THAT AREA.
TST3-MUC4-0046	BOGOTA, 10 OCT 89 -- "THE EXTRADITABLES," THE ARMED BRANCH OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL HAVE CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MURDER OF TWO EMPLOYEES OF BOGOTA'S DAILY EL ESPECTADOR PERPETRATED TODAY IN MEDELLIN, A SOURCE FROM THAT NEWSPAPER TOLD EFE. MIGUEL SOLER RODRIGUEZ, EL ESPECTATOR'S CIRCULATION MANAGER AND MARTHA LUZ LOPEZ, THE CORRESPONDENT'S OFFICE ADMINISTRATOR, WERE KILLED TODAY IN SEPARATE ATTACKS CARRIED OUT BY GUNMEN IN MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA'S SECOND LARGEST CITY AND CAPITAL OF THE ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT. SHORTLY AFTER THE MURDERS, AN ANONYMOUS CALL WAS RECEIVED AT EL ESPECTADOR'S OFFICE IN MEDELLIN, THREATENING TO KILL ALL THE EDITORS AND OFFICE PERSONNEL WHO DO NOT RESIGN IN 3 DAYS. "THE EXTRADITABLES," THE VOICE SAID, "DO NOT WANT THAT NEWSPAPER CIRCULATING IN ANTIOQUIA ANYMORE." MARTHA LUZ LOPEZ, 35, WHO WORKED FOR EL ESPECTADOR 11 YEARS, WAS KILLED BY TWO MEN ON MOTORCYCLES WHO INTERCEPTED HER CAR AT A CORNER AND SHOT HER SEVERAL TIMES. AT THE MOMENT OF THE ATTACK, SHE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HER MOTHER MARTHA LOPEZ OROZCO DE LOPEZ, WHO WAS WOUNDED. SOLER, WHO WAS 45-YEARS OLD AND HAD WORKED FOR 25 YEARS AT EL ESPECTATOR, WAS ALSO KILLED BY UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS WHILE HE WAS ON HIS WAY BACK TO HIS RESIDENCE. SOLER, WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF ADVERTISING AND CIRCULATION OF EL ESPECTADOR IN MEDELLIN AND THE NORTHWESTERN AREA OF COLOMBIA, WAS MARRIED AND THE FATHER OF THREE CHILDREN. THE MAIN OFFICES IN BOGOTA OF EL ESPECTADOR, THE NEWSPAPER MOST THREATENED BY COLOMBIA'S DRUG TRAFFICKING MAFIA, WERE PARTIALLY DESTROYED ON 2 SEPTEMBER WHEN A CAR BOMB EXPLOSION INJURED OVER 90 PEOPLE. NEWSPAPER DIRECTOR GUILLERMO CANO WAS MURDERED AS HE WAS LEAVING HIS OFFICE ON 17 DECEMBER 1986. THIS CRIME WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, WHICH TOGETHER WITH THE CALI CARTEL, IS CONSIDERED TO BE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT ORGANIZATIONS IN THE WORLD INVOLVED IN THE TRAFFICKING AND DISTRIBUTION OF COCAINE. NEWSPAPER ATTORNEY AND JOURNALIST HECTOR GIRALDO GALVEZ, WHO WAS THE CIVIL PROSECUTOR IN THE INVESTIGATION INTO GUILLERMO CANO'S HOMICIDE, WAS ALSO MURDERED IN BOGOTA ON 29 MARCH. EL ESPECTADOR HAS CHARACTERIZED ITSELF BY REJECTING AND CONDEMNING DRUG TRAFFICKING AND OTHER CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES INVOLVING MAFIOSOS.
TST3-MUC4-0047	MOSCOW , 12 OCT 89 -- THE MOST PRESSING DEMANDS OF THE CHILEAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP IN THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN THE COMBINING OF THE CAMPAIGN WITH THE JUST ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, AND SOCIAL DEMANDS THAT THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES AND THE POPULAR MOVEMENT HAVE BEEN MAKING FOR THESE 16 YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP. THESE DEMANDS ARE RELATED TO THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REPRESSION, THE DEFENSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE DENUNCIATION OF CRIMES COMMITTED BY THE REGIME, AND EFFORTS TO FIGHT IMMUNITY AND THE SUPPRESSION OF THE TRUTH REGARDING TORTURE, DISAPPEARANCES, AND ASSASSINATIONS. THESE QUESTIONS HAVE ONCE AGAIN COME INTO THE SPOTLIGHT NOW THAT MANY RIGHTIST CANDIDATES ARE DEMAGOGICALLY ATTEMPTING TO POSE AS DEFENDERS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND SINCE EL MERCURIO HAS REPORTED THAT THE DICTATOR IS PLANNING TO CONVERT THE CNI INTO AN AGENCY OF THE ARMY SO THAT THE MAIN REPRESSIVE BODY FROM ALL THESE YEARS CAN BE UNDER HIS DIRECT CONTROL. JAIME INZUNZA, LEADER OF THE UNITED LEFT AND THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE, DISCUSSES THESE TOPICS OVER A DIRECT PHONE LINE FROM SANTIAGO, CHILE. HOW ARE THE CHILEAN PEOPLE'S DEMANDS CONNECTED TO THE ONGOING ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN? THEY ARE CONNECTED THROUGH THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD BOARDS DURING THE ELECTORAL PROCESS; THE STRENGTHENING OF THE UNIFIED ACTIONS OF WORKERS; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMITTEES FOR VICTORY, WHICH WILL ALSO BE COMMITTEES FOR THE DEFENSE OF VICTORY AND COMMITTEES FOR CARRYING ON THE DEMOCRATIC TASK; THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONFIDENCE; THE STRUGGLE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY CONCERNING TRUTH AND JUSTICE AND IMMUNITY FOR CRIMES; THE INCREASING PRESSURE BY THE IMMENSE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION FOR THE RELEASE OF ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS; AND NATURALLY FOR THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CNI. ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE BEING BROUGHT UP IN THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN, AND AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN REACHED WITHIN SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS. THIS WAS EVIDENCED A WEEK AGO BY THE SALVADORA STRIKE AND BY THE CURRENT STRIKE BY COAL MINERS. THIS PROVES THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN HAS TO BE AN EXPRESSION OF THEIR ACTIVITIES AND A WAY TO STRENGTHEN THEIR SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS FOR THE FUTURE STRUGGLE. THE PRECEDING COMMENTS WERE MADE BY COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE LEADER JAIME INZUNZA, WHO HAS BEEN INTERVIEWED OVER THE TELEPHONE ON OUR PROGRAM "ESCUCHA CHILE." ANOTHER TOPIC DISCUSSED BY INZUNZA WAS THE EL MERCURIO REPORT ON THE CNI'S TRANSFER TO THE ARMY. THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CNI HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING DEMANDS OF THE IMMENSE MAJORITY OF CHILEANS. WHAT IS YOUR OPINION, JAIME INZUNZA, ON THE DICTATOR'S INTENTION TO MAINTAIN THE CNI AS IT IS AND TO KEEP IT UNDER HIS DIRECT COMMAND? I BELIEVE THAT THIS ISSUE IS PARTICULARLY SERIOUS. THE INTENTION IS TO MAINTAIN INTACT THE MAIN TERRORIST APPARATUS OF THE DICTATORSHIP, WHICH HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MOST FLAGRANT VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS OF ITS EXISTENCE. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE DINA AND THE CNI HAVE BEEN IN FACT A SINGLE APPARATUS AND THEREFORE THE MAIN ORGANS OF STATE TERRORRISM OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS. IF TRANSFERRED TO THE ARMY, THE CNI WOULD CONTINUE TO BE UNDER PINOCHET'S ORDERS. UNDER WHOSE ORDERS HAS IT BEEN ALL THESE YEARS? FOR WHOM HAS IT BEEN A DIRECT AGENT ALL THESE YEARS? HENCEFORTH IT WILL BE UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE OFFICE OF THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMY. COMMUNIST LEADER JAIME INZUNZA ADDED THAT PINOCHET'S INTENT IN TRANSFERRING THE CNI TO THE ARMY'S DIRECT COMMAND IS TO MAKE THE INSTITUTION AN ACCOMPLICE IN CONCEALING PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR CRIMES AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. THE IDEA IS TO INVOLVE THE MILITARY INSTITUTION IN CRIMES FOR WHICH THE CHILEAN PEOPLE KNOWS IT WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE. THIS IS CLEAR: WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION FORCES WANT IS TO HAVE THE CULPRITS BEHIND THOSE CRIMES AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS PROSECUTED, NOT THE MILITARY INSTITUTION. THE TRANSFER OF THE CNI TO THE ARMY IS AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE MEN IN UNIFORM ACT AS ACCOMPLICES OR ACCESSORIES TO THOSE CRIMES. LOYALTY IS NOT AT STAKE HERE; LOYALTY IS DEFENDING VALUES AND PRINCIPLES, NOT SOME SORT OF CRIMINAL COMPLICITY THAT IS NOT IN LINE WITH THE TRAINING OF THESE MEN. THIS SEEMS TO ME TO BE PARTICULARLY SERIOUS BECAUSE THIS TRANSFER IMPLIES MAINTAINING THE CNI UNDER THE ORDERS OF THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIMES COMMITTED ALL THESE YEARS, THE DICTATOR HIMSELF. THESE HAVE BEEN ANSWERS GIVEN BY JAIME INZUNZA, UNITED LEFT AND COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE LEADER, TO QUESTIONS PUT TO HIM OVER THE PHONE BY "ESCUCHA CHILE," A RADIO MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM.
TST3-MUC4-0048	PANAMA CITY , 3 NOV 89 -- GUATEMALAN ARCHBISHOP PROSPERO PENADOS DEL BARRIO TODAY REPORTED THE KIDNAPPING OF A NUN, DIANA MACK ORTIZ, 20 YEARS OLD, BORN IN THE STATE OF COLORADO IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE ARCHBISHOP ALSO REPORTED THAT ANOTHER U.S. NUN, PATRICIA DENNY, LEFT GUATEMALA 17 DAYS AGO BECAUSE OF CONTINUOUS DEATH THREATS OVER THE TELEPHONE AND IN WRITING. PENADOS SAID DIANA MACK ORTIZ WAS KIDNAPPED ON 2 NOVEMBER IN ANTIGUA GUATEMALA, 45 KM SOUTH OF GUATEMALA CITY, WHEN SHE WAS ATTENDING A SEMINAR ALONG WITH OTHER NUNS. THE ARCHBISHOP EXPLAINED THE NUN HAD BEEN RECEIVING DEATH THREATS. SHE HAD BEEN URGED TO LEAVE GUATEMALA, BUT SHE DECIDED TO CONTINUE WORKING IN THIS COUNTRY. THE KIDNAPPED NUN, WHO HAD BEEN IN GUATEMALA FOR A YEAR, WAS TEACHING AT THE SAN MIGUEL ACATAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN HUEHUETENANGO DEPARTMENT IN NORTHEAST GUATEMALA. SHE BELONGS TO THE ORDER OF THE URSILINA, PENADOS REPORTED. PATRICIA DENNY, 54, LEFT GUATEMALA AFTER UNIDENTIFIED MEN WARNED HER THAT IF SHE WISHED TO CONTINUE LIVING SHE HAD TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY. DENNY HAD ARRIVED IN GUATEMALA IN 1984, BELONGED TO THE SISTERS OF MARY KNOLL, AND WAS WORKING AT A PARISH IN MIXCO MUNICIPALITY IN SOUTHERN GUATEMALA CITY. THE ARCHBISHOP SAID ALL THIS IS THE "BEGINNING OF A CAMPAIGN TO INTIMIDATE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH." HE DID NOT MENTION WHICH GROUPS ARE PERPETRATING THESE INTIMIDATION ACTIONS. HOWEVER, PENADOS SAID HE IS GOING TO TALK TO GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO TODAY TO REPORT THE INCIDENTS WITH THE U.S. NUNS. PENADOS STATED THAT THIS KIND OF ACTION "HARMED CATHOLICISM VERY MUCH IN PAST YEARS," WHEN REPRESSION SEVERELY HIT THIS SECTOR. HE POINTED OUT THAT THIS KIND OF INCIDENT HAD NOT HAPPENED SINCE PRESIDENT CEREZO TOOK OVER POWER IN GUATEMALA ON 14 JANUARY 1986. THE ARCHBISHOP DEMANDED THAT MACK ORTIZ' KIDNAPPERS RESPECT HER LIFE AND PHYSICAL INTEGRITY.
TST3-MUC4-0049	SANTIAGO, 3 NOV 89 -- THE GOVERNMENTS OF CHILE AND EL SALVADOR HAVE SIGNED A JOINT DECLARATION IN WHICH THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THE MARKET ECONOMY PRINCIPLES ARE THE MAIN FORCE OF DEVELOPMENT. THE DECLARATION WAS SIGNED BY FOREIGN MINISTER HERNAN FELIPE ERRAZURIZ AND BY SALVADORAN FOREIGN MINISTER MANUEL PACAS, WHO TODAY CONCLUDED AN OFFICIAL VISIT TO CHILE. THE JOINT COMMUNIQUE REASSERTS BOTH COUNTRIES' COMMITMENT TO THE GROWING LIBERATION OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND IT REJECTS THE OBSTACLES THAT HINDER EXCHANGE. THE DOCUMENT LIKEWISE EXPRESSES THE CONCERN OF CHILE AND EL SALVADOR OVER TERRORIST ACITIVITY IN LATIN AMERICA AND FOREIGN SUPPORT TO SUBVERSIVE GROUPS. THE TWO COUNTRIES AGREE THAT BOTH ACTIVITIES HINDER DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AFTER SIGNING THE JOINT DECLARATION, THE SALVADORAN FOREIGN MINISTER GAVE A NEWS CONFERENCE IN WHICH HE REGRETTED THE FACT THAT THE GUERRILLA ABANDONED THE TALKS SPONSORED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI. PACAS SAID THAT THIS ATTITUDE DEMONSTRATES THAT THE EXTREMISTS DO NOT WANT PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.
TST3-MUC4-0050	SAN SALVADOR, 5 NOV 89 -- ON 5 NOVEMBER, RADIO VENCEREMOS REPORTS THAT GUERRILLAS HAVE CARRIED OUT 2 AMBUSHES ALONG THE PANAMERICAN HIGHWAY, INFLICTING 26 ARMY CASUALTIES.

TST3-MUC4-0052	LIMA, 7 NOV 89 -- THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT TODAY DECREED A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND MILITARY CONTROL IN FOUR LIMA PROVINCES AND EXTENDED THE MEASURE IN ANOTHER FIVE. THIS MEANS ALL OF LIMA DEPARTMENT, WITH A POPULATION OF OVER 6 MILLION PEOPLE, IS UNDER A STATE OF EMERGENCY. THIS GOVERNMENT DECISION IS A RESULT OF THE TERRORIST ACTIVITY IN THE PROVINCES AND AN ATTEMPT TO PREVENT THE BOYCOTT OF THE ELECTION WHICH WAS DECREED BY THE MAOIST "SHINING PATH" ORGANIZATION. LIMA DEPARTMENT IS THE LARGEST PERUVIAN DEPARTMENT IN BOTH POPULATION AND ELECTORAL STRENGTH. IT IS MADE UP OF 10 PROVINCES, INCLUDING LIMA PROVINCE, WHICH CONTAINS 90 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION, AND THE CALLAO PORT, WHICH IS RECOGNIZED AS A CONSTITUTIONAL PROVINCE. ACCORDING TO THE DECREES PUBLISHED TODAY, THE GOVERNMENT IS ESTABLISHING A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN THE PROVINCES OF AND CANETE, WHILE THE EMERGENCY IN EFFECT IN BARRANCA, CAJATAMBO, HUAURA, YAUYOS, AND OYON WILL BE EXTENDED ANOTHER 30 DAYS.

TST3-MUC4-0053	CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- WE ARE HEARING STATEMENTS BY COMMANDER JORGE SHAFIK HANDAL, WHO IS TALKING ABOUT COL PONCE AND CRISTIANI'S RESPONSIBILITY IN THE TERRORIST ATTACK ON FENASTRAS. THIS INCIDENT PROMPTED A VISIT TO OUR COUNTRY BY U.S. OFFICIAL BERNARD ARONSON. LET US HEAR WHAT COMMANDER HANDAL HAS TO SAY ABOUT THE U.S. OFFICIAL'S VISIT. OF COURSE, THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT WANT TO APPEAR AS IF IT WERE WITHDRAWING SUPPORT FROM PRESIDENT CRISTIANI. WE WERE JUST SAYING THAT ARONSON HAD ARRIVED AND HE LOOKED WORRIED. THE NICE LOOKING GLASS HOUSE THEY HAD BUILT HAS RAPIDLY BEGUN TO FALL APART. ARONSON APPARENTLY CAME TO SEE HOW HE COULD PATCH THINGS UP. WE RECALL A SIMILAR HIGH-LEVEL VISIT BACK AROUND 1984, IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME RIGHT, WHEN THE CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENT ARRIVED. AT THAT TIME HE WAS VICE PRESIDENT UNDER THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, NO, THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION, AND CAME TO SEE HOW TO IMPROVE THE SUPPOSEDLY CENTRIST GOVERNMENT AND HOW TO PUT AN END TO THE DEATH SQUADS. HE TOOK A LIST BACK WITH HIM... LET US TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THEY OPERATE. WHEN THEY TAKE ANY ACTION THEY ARE VERY CLEAR AND DIRECT. THEY HAD A POLITICAL INTEREST IN PUTTING ALL THIS TOGETHER, SO BUSH TOOK BACK WITH HIM A LIST OF 15 MILITARY MEMBERS SO THEY COULD BE FIRED.
TST3-MUC4-0054	SAN SALVADOR, 12 NOV 89 -- SALVADORAN PEOPLE: GOOD MORNING. I AM SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES THAT IS ON ITS FEET AT 0115 ON 12 NOVEMBER, CONFRONTING A TREACHEROUS ATTACK BY THE FMLN TERRORISTS WHO AT 2000 ON 11 NOVEMBER--DISPLAYING THEIR WARMONGERING STRATEGY AND WITHOUT CARING ABOUT THE SUFFERING OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE--CARRIED OUT TREACHEROUS ACTIONS IN WHICH THE CIVILIAN POPULATION WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO HAVE SUFFERED. THE MILITARY AND PUBLIC SECURITY PERSONNEL HAVE REACTED IN AN EFFICIENT MANNER IN REJECTING THE TERRORIST ENEMY. WE ARE OBLIGATED TO REPORT TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WHAT HAS HAPPENED. THE MOST IMPORTANT ACTIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE ON THE NIGHT OF 11 NOVEMBER ARE AS FOLLOWS: AN ATTACK ON THE RESIDENCE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY PRESIDENT, WHO IS UNHARMED; AND AN ATTACK ON THE CENTRAL ELECTIONS COUNCIL WHERE NO MATERIAL DAMAGE OR CASUALTIES OCCURRED. LIKEWISE, THERE WAS AN ATTACK ON THE PRESIDENTIAL RESIDENCE WHICH CAUSED SLIGHT MATERIAL DAMAGE AND NO CASUALTIES. FORTUNATELY FOR ALL SALVADORANS, THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC IS UNDER FULL PROTECTION AND HE WAS NEVER IN ANY DANGER. LIKEWISE, WE REPORT THAT THERE WAS AN ATTACK ON HIS PRIVATE RESIDENCE. WE ALSO WANT TO REPORT TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE THAT SOME MILITARY PERSONNEL WERE HARASSED, SUCH AS THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE, THE NATIONAL POLICE GARRISON IN THE ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD, AND THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE IN USULUTAN CITY WHERE ONE MINOR WAS INJURED. THERE WAS ALSO HARASSMENT OF THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE WITH HEADQUARTERS IN SAN MIGUEL. THERE WAS NO MATERIAL DAMAGE AND THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES.
TST3-MUC4-0055	SAN SALVADOR, 12 NOV 89 -- THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS ASSURED TODAY THEY HAVE "CONSOLIDATED" FOUR OF THE MOST DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR WHERE SOME 300,000 PERSONS LIVE. COMMANDER AMILCAR, ONE OF THE REBEL CHIEFS WHO HAS OCCUPIED THE ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD, TOLD ACAN - EFE THAT HE AND HIS MEN CAME TO SAN SALVADOR "PREPARED, AND WITH SUFFICIENT AMMUNITION TO REMAIN FOR SEVERAL DAYS." IN A GENERAL ASSESEMENT OF THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE, THE YOUNG COMMANDER SAID THAT THE ARMY "CANNOT ENTER" THE "AREA UNDER REBEL CONTROL," BUT IT IS ATTACKING THE REBELS FROM THE NATIONAL POLICE HEADQUARTERS AND USING HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS. "HOWEVER, THE PEOPLE HAVE THE TRUMP CARD ," HE ADDED. AMILCAR, WHO IS 26-YEARS-AGO AND LOOKS LIKE A STUDENT, WAS WALKING DOWN THE HALLWAYS OF ONE OF THE CRAMPED FIVE-STORY APARTMENT BUILDINGS IN ZACAMIL WHILE EXPLAINING THAT THE GOAL OF THE REBEL OFFENSIVE IS "TO SEEK OPTIONS FOR BUILDING PEACE IN EL SALVADOR." HE ADDED THAT THE GUERRILLAS SEEK "TO DISRUPT THE DIALOGUE CONDITIONS, AND GO TO THE CONVERSATIONS WITH A POLITICAL AND MILITARY ADVANTAGE SO THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL AGREE WITH US ON WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT: DEMOCRACY, A PEOPLE'S ECONOMIC POLICY, AND A PURGE IN THE ARMED FORCES, AMONG OTHER THINGS." THE GUERRILLAS AND THE GOVERNMENT OF EL SALVADOR HAVE HELD TWO MEETINGS IN RECENT MONTHS, THE FIRST ONE IN MEXICO AND THE SECOND ONE IN COSTA RICA. A THIRD MEETING WAS TO BE HELD SHORTLY IN VENEZUELA, BUT THE FMLN ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL NOT ATTEND. THE FMLN LAUNCHED THE MOST IMPORTANT MILITARY OFFENSIVE SINCE 1981 ON 11 NOVEMBER, ATTACKING 50 MILITARY POSITIONS, 20 OF THEM IN SAN SALVADOR. IN THE FIRST 24 HOURS, THE OFFENSIVE HAS CAUSED NEARLY 300 CASUALTIES ACCORDING TO THE ARMY, AND OVER 400 CASUALTIES ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLAS. THE OFFENSIVE HAS BEEN NAMED "OUT WITH THE FASCISTS! FEBE ELIZABETH LIVES!" IN HOMAGE TO A TRADE UNION LEADER KILLED 13 DAYS AGO ALONG WITH NINE OTHER WORKERS IN A DYNAMITE EXPLOSION IN THE CAPITAL CITY ATTRIBUTED TO THE ULTRARIGHTIST DEATH SQUADS. ARMED WITH AN AUTOMATIC AK-47 RIFLE, AMILCAR SAID THAT THE FMLN "HAS CONSOLIDATED THE ZACAMIL, CUSCATANCINGO, MEJICANOS, AND PANAMA NEIGHBORHOODS, AND WE HAVE BESIEGED THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE." ALL THE PLACES HE MENTIONED ARE IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, WHERE THE BLOODIEST CLASHES BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS HAVE TAKEN PLACE. AT NIGHTFALL ON 12 NOVEMBER AND PRIOR TO THE CURFEW THAT BEGINS AT 2000 , THE RESIDENTS OF ZACAMIL WERE OUTSIDE THEIR BUILDINGS CARRYING CANDLES AS THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY. AMILCAR ASSURED THAT THE GUERRILLAS HAVE INFLICTED AT LEAST 18 CASUALTIES ON THE ARMED FORCES IN THAT AREA AND HAVE SEIZED ABOUT 20 RIFLES AND 1 M-60 MACHINEGUN. "THIS OFFENSIVE IS A MILITARY AND POLITICAL ACHIEVEMENT. AS A RESULT OF THE CLOSING OF THE COMALAPA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, THE MAIN AIRPORT OF THE COUNTRY, WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN LETTING THE WORLD THAT WE ARE AT WAR AND ARE AN EMERGING POWER," THE REBEL COMMANDER SAID. COMALAPA AIRPORT, LOCATED 50 KM SOUTH OF SAN SALVADOR, WAS CLOSED "FOR SECURITY REASONS." ACORDING TO THE FMLN CLANDESTINE STATION, RADIO VENCEREMOS, THE GUERRILLA FIGHTERS DESTROYED THREE MILITARY HELICOPTERS ON THE GROUND AND CAUSED SOME DAMAGE ON THE AIRPORTS'S MAIN LANDING STRIP. REFERRING TO THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO IMPOSE A CURFEW AND A NATIONWIDE STATE OF SIEGE EFFECTIVE TONIGHT, COMMANDER AMILCAR SAID: "WE HAD ALREADY TAKEN THIS INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN WE LAUNCHED THE OFFENSIVE." THE GOVERNMENT "CANNOT ACT INDISCRIMINATELY AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION," AMILCAR SAID; ADDING THAT "THE CITIZENS' RIGHTS WERE SUSPENDED TO BOMB THE PLACES TAKEN OVER BY OUR FORCES." THE PEOPLE OF ZACAMIL AND OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS LOCATED NORTH OF THE CAPITAL HAVE LIVED IN TERROR SINCE SATURDAY, 11 NOVEMBER, WHEN THEY WERE TRAPPED IN THE CROSSFIRE BETWEEN THE REBELS AND THE MILITARY, SUBJECTED TO THE AIR RAIDS AND THE THREAT THAT LIVING WITH THE GUERRILLA MEMBERS REPRESENTS TO THEM. AT LEAST TWO CIVILIANS HAVE DIED IN ZACAMIL AND FIVE MORE HAVE BEEN WOUNDED, INCLUDING TWO CHILDREN, AS A RESULT OF THE ARMED CLASHES.
TST3-MUC4-0056	CLANDESTINE, 13 NOV 89 -- WE HAVE A LAST MINUTE REPORT FROM SAN MIGUEL. AT EXACTLY 1100 1700 GMT YESTERDAY, 12 NOVEMBER, AN ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER WAS DESTROYED WITH AN RPG-7 ROCKET . FOUR ENEMY CASUALTIES WERE REPORTED. WE REPEAT: AN ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER WAS DESTROYED BY OUR FIGHTERS IN SAN MIGUEL. OUR FIGHTERS USED AN RPG-7 ROCKET LAUNCHER TO DESTROY THE ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER. NOW WE HAVE MORE INFORMATION FROM SAN SALVADOR. AT 0800 1400 GMT THIS MORNING, A C-47 PLANE FLEW OVER AND STRAFED THE MEJICANOS DOWNTOWN AREA, WHERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIVE. ACCORDING TO THE REPORT WE RECEIVED, MANY CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN INJURED. WE WERE ALSO ADVISED THAT THE C-47 LEFT THE AREA AFTER ITS ATTACK. WE ONCE AGAIN CALL ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO PRESSURE ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT TO STOP THIS KIND OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION. THESE ACTIONS ARE DIRECTED AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. THE ARMED FORCES HAS BEEN SHELLING AND STRAFING DENSELY POPULATED AREAS IN SAN SALVADOR SINCE SATURDAY. IN THE PAST WE HAVE DENOUNCED INDISCRIMINATE SHELLING OF RURAL AREAS; HOWEVER, THESE ARE UNPRECEDENTED ATTACKS. THIS SHELLING AND BOMBING HAS ALREADY RESULTED IN MANY CIVILIAN CASUALTIES.
TST3-MUC4-0057	SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 -- A HIGH-RANKING UNITED NATIONS OFFICIAL IN SAN SALVADOR TODAY VOICED DISAPPROVAL REGARDING THE SUPPORT EXPRESSED BY NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA FOR THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT . "NICARAGUA'S SUPPORT FOR THE FMLN IS AN INSULT TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PROCESS," SAID THE UNITED NATIONS OFFICIAL WHO WISHED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS. HE IS PARTICIPATING IN THE UNITED NATIONS PEACE EFFORTS IN THE AREA. THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FMLN ON 11 NOVEMBER, THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE SINCE 1981, HAS ALREADY RESULTED IN 139 DEAD AND 313 WOUNDED, INCLUDING SOLDIERS, REBELS, AND CIVILIANS, GOVERNMENT SOURCES REPORTED TODAY. ORTEGA, ON 11 NOVEMBER, DESCRIBED THE ARMY'S ACTIONS AS A "GENOCIDE" AND A "MASSACRE," REFERRING TO THE BOMBINGS OF NEIGHBORHOODS OCCUPIED BY THE GUERRILLAS. ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL, THE OPEN SUPPORT VOICED BY ORTEGA TO THE SALVADORAN REBELS "IS A MISTAKE AND AN INTERVENTION." THE UN OFFICIAL EMPHASIZED THAT "THIS GIVES THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT AN INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION AND THE UNITED STATES HAS SAID THAT IS HAS NOT RULED OUT AN INTERVENTION IN THE AREA DUE TO THE NICARAGUAN SUPPORT TO THE MARXIST GUERRILLA OF EL SALVADOR." THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT OF RIGHTIST ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS BLAMED ORTEGA FOR VIOLATING THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE AGREEMENTS BY GIVING MORAL AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT TO THE FMLN. ON 12 NOVEMBER, CRISTIANI ASKED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO CONDEMN PRESIDENT ORTEGA'S POSITION.
TST3-MUC4-0058	CLANDESTINE, 14 NOV 89 -- TODAY, 14 NOVEMBER, NEW ATTACKS ARE TAKING PLACE AGAINST POSITIONS OF THE JOINT STAFF OF THE ARMED FORCES. THE PINK ZONE IS TURNING BLACK FOR THE ENEMY. OUR FORCES ARE CLASHING WITH THE ZACAMIL BATTALION. WE HAVE A REPORT FROM THE CAPITAL SAYING THAT THIS AFTERNOON, FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT FORCES WERE STRONGLY ATTACKING ZACAMIL BATTALION TROOPS. THE FMLN TROOPS ARE HARASSING THE JOINT STAFF OF THE ARMED FORCES AT THIS TIME. BARRICADES ARE BEING SET UP THROUGHOUT THE CAPITAL ON THIS 4TH DAY OF FIGHTING. THIS IS THE SECOND ATTACK ON THE JOINT STAFF IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS BECAUSE, AS WE SAID LAST NIGHT, FMLN TROOPS INITIATED ATTACKS AGAINST THE SAN BENITO BATTALION AT THE INTERNATIONAL FAIR AND AGAINST THE FORCES DEFENDING THE JOINT STAFF OF THE ARMED FORCES. THIS IS THE SECOND ATTACK AGAINST THE JOINT STAFF, WHICH COMPLICATES THE OVERALL SITUATION FOR THE ARMED FORCES IN THE CAPITAL. WE ARE ATTACKING THE TOP COMMAND OF THE ENEMY FORCES. FMLN FORCES ARE ATTACKING THE HEART AND THE BRAIN OF THE ENEMY. SALVADORAN AIR FORCE PLANES ARE OVERFLYING AREAS NORTH OF THE CAPITAL, AND THEY CONTINUE MACHINEGUNNING AND BOMBING CIVILIAN AREAS. A FEW MINUTES AGO, WE REPORTED HEAVY BOMBING IN ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD.
TST3-MUC4-0059	LA PAZ, 15 NOV 89 -- EARLY THIS MORNING THE GOVERNMENT DECREED A STATE OF SIEGE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY TO END THE SOCIAL CRISIS AND TO PROTECT THE INTERNAL ORDER, WHICH HAS BEEN DISRUPTED OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS. THIS REPORT IS INCLUDED IN A GOVERNMENT DECREE APPROVED BY PRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA. ACCORDING TO INTERIOR MINISTRY UNDER SECRETARY RAUL LOAYZA, POLICE ARRESTED 500 TEACHERS AND EDUCATION LEADERS IN THE NINE DEPARTMENTAL CAPITALS, THUS THWARTING THE EXTENDED HUNGER STRIKE. THE STRIKE BY TEACHERS, WHO HAVE BEEN DEMANDING A BONUS OF 300 BOLIVIAN PESOS, HAS UNLEASHED VIOLENT STREET CONFRONTATIONS OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS AND AT LEAST FOUR BOMBINGS. THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAS BEEN BESIEGED BY A WAVE OF SOCIAL DEMANDS AND PRESSURED BY THE 80,000 TEACHERS, HAS STATED THAT THESE DEMONSTRATIONS ARE UNDERMINING DEMOCRATIC STABILITY. IT ADDED THAT DESPITE EFFORTS TO FIND A PATH TO PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE AND DIALOGUE, IT HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO PREVENT RADICAL GROUPS INTERESTED IN THE UNION LEADERSHIP FROM PUBLICLY CHALLENGING THE GOVERNMENT. THE GOVERNMENT DECREE STATES THAT IT WILL GUARANTEE THE 3 DECEMBER MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS AND PROTECT THE CITIZENS' RIGHT TO VOTE. A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE RELEASE OF THIS DECREE TO THE PRESS, POLICE PATROLS RAIDED THE CENTERS WHERE THE HUNGER STRIKES WERE TAKING PLACE. POLICE USED EXCESSIVE FORCE IN THESE RAIDS. THE 250 STRIKERS ARRESTED IN LA PAZ WERE TAKEN IN TRUCKS AND BUSES OF THE POLICE, THE AIR FORCE, AND OTHER STATE INSTITUTIONS, TO THE EL ELTO AIR BASE. THE GOVERNMENT REPORTED THAT 250 STRIKERS WERE ALSO ARRESTED IN THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY. IT ADDED THAT THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STRIKE WILL BE SENT TO DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY. OTHER, LESS RESPONSIBLE GROUPS OF STRIKERS WILL BE TRIED BY THE REGULAR COURTS. OTHERS WILL BE RELEASED. THE THREE LA PAZ TEACHERS' LEADERS HAVE BEEN SENT TO DIFFERENT HOSPITALS IN LA PAZ AND PLACED IN INTENSIVE CARE. THEY ARE MIGUEL LORA, TELMO ROMAN, AND LUIS ALVAREZ, WHO ARE NOT FACING ANY RISK OF DEATH, THE INTERIOR MINISTRY UNDER SECRETARY STATED. HE WARNED THAT THE BOLIVIAN LABOR CONFEDERATION UNDERGROUND SESSIONS WILL BE ILLEGAL, AND THEY ARE NOT THE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR LABOR ORGANIZATIONS, HE SAID. THIS IS THE FIRST SOCIAL CRISIS PRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA HAS HAD TO FACE SINCE HE ASSUMED POWER ALMOST 100 DAYS AGO.
TST3-MUC4-0060	CLANDESTINE, 16 NOV 89 -- THE HUMAN RIGHTS PROMOTION AND PROTECTION SECRETARIAT OF THE FMLN STRONGLY CONDEMNS THE MASSACRE OF FIVE SPANISH-BORN JESUIT PRIESTS AND THREE SALVADORAN CITIZENS CARRIED OUT BY THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES SOLDIERS. IGNORING A MARTIAL LAW PROHIBITING ALL TRAVEL, EARLY THIS MORNING A LARGE NUMBER OF HEAVILY ARMED SOLDIERS BURST INTO THE RESIDENCE OF THE PRIESTS WHO MANAGE THE JOSE SIMEON CANAS CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY . THE SOLDIERS BROKE INTO THE PRIESTS' BEDROOMS, CAPTURED THEM, AND BRUTALLY MURDERED THEM IN THE GARDEN. THE VICTIMS OF THIS HATEFUL COLLECTIVE CRIME WERE: PRIEST AND DR IGNACIO ELLACURIA, THE UCA DIRECTOR; PRIEST AND DR IGNACIO MARTIN BARO, UCA DEPUTY DIRECTOR; PRIEST AND DR SEGUNDO MONTES, UCA HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTE DIRECTOR; PRIEST AND DR AMANDO LOPEZ, UCA DEAN; PRIEST JUAN RAMON MORENO; AND JOAQUIN LOPEZ Y LOPEZ, AS WELL AS JULIA RAMOS AND HER 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, ELVA RAMOS. THE PERSONS WHO ORDERED THE HORRIBLE MURDER OF THE JESUITS AND THREE SALVADORAN CITIZENS ARE THE SAME ONES WHO ORDERED PILOTS, ARTILLERY MEN, AND MACHINEGUNNERS IN PLANES TO ATTACK THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. THEY ARE THE SAME ONES WHO ARE AGAINST REACHING A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT. THEY ARE THE TOP MILITARY AND POLITICAL FIGURES IN ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S ADMINISTRATION. THE HUMAN RIGHTS PROMOTION AND PROTECTION SECRETARIAT CALLS ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO TIE THE HANDS OF THESE MURDERERS OF SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND TO AID IN FINDING A SOLUTION TO THE NATIONAL CRISIS SO WE MAY ATTAIN A JUST AND LASTING PEACE OUR PEOPLE SO DESIRE. NO MORE BARBARIC ACTIONS IN SAN SALVADOR. NO MORE INJUSTICES. TRIAL AND PUNISHMENT FOR THE MURDERERS. THE MILITARY AND POLITICAL LEADERS OF CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT MUST BE OUSTED. EL SALVADOR, 16 NOV 1989
TST3-MUC4-0061	MOSCOW , 14 NOV 89 -- FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT DETACHMENTS HAVE CONDUCTED THE LARGEST MILITARY OPERATION IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL. AN OFFENSIVE WAS LAUNCHED SIMULTANEOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY'S TERRITORY; HOWEVER, SAN SALVADOR'S CITY BLOCKS, WHICH WERE THE SCENE OF FIERCE FIGHTING BETWEEN FMLN DETACHMENTS AND GOVERNMENT TROOPS, WERE THE EPICENTER OF SUNDAY'S EVENTS. THE INTENSE FIREFIGHT INVOLVING ARTILLERY AND HELICOPTERS LASTED APPROXIMATELY 18 HOURS AND ENCOMPASSED VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE CAPITAL, COMPLETELY PARALYZING LIFE IN THE CITY. ACCORDING TO REUTER, ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO STORM PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S OFFICIAL AND PERSONAL RESIDENCES; HOWEVER, IT IS REPORTED THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT HURT. REPORTS OF THE LOSSES ON BOTH SIDES ARE CONTRADICTORY. A STATE OF SIEGE HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN EL SALVADOR AND CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED. A CURFEW IS IN FORCE IN THE CAPITAL, AND THE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT HAS BEEN CLOSED. ACCORDING TO PRESIDENT CRISTIANI, WHOSE SPEECH WAS BROADCAST ON THE RADIO, THESE STEPS ARE NEEDED TO "DEFEND THE POPULATION AGAINST LEFT-WING TERRORISM." ACCORDING TO THE PRESIDENT, THE MILITARY ARE IN COMPLETE CONTROL OF THE SITUATION; HOWEVER, IT IS REPORTED FROM SAN SALVADOR THAT THESE WORDS BY A. CRISTIANI WERE HEARD ON THE AIRWAVES ACCOMPANIED BY CONTINUAL EXPLOSIONS AND SHOOTING. INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS REGARD EVENTS IN SAN SALVADOR IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INTERRUPTED TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE INSURGENTS. THE THIRD ROUND OF THESE TALKS SHOULD HAVE BEEN HELD RECENTLY IN CARACAS, BUT OPPOSITION REPRESENTATIVES REFUSED TO TAKE PART IN THEM AFTER A LEFT-WING TRADE UNION'S HEADQUARTERS WAS SUBJECTED TO ARTILLERY BOMBARDMENT RESULTING IN THE DEATHS OF AT LEAST 10 PEOPLE. ACCORDING TO THE INSURGENTS, THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED ON DIALOGUE WITH THEM SOLELY OUT OF PROPAGANDA CONSIDERATIONS, WITH NO INTENTION OF REACHING ANY AGREEMENT. SUNDAY'S OFFENSIVE WAS THUS AN ATTEMPT ON THEIR PART TO SHOW THEMSELVES TO BE A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH. IN THE OPINION OF OBSERVERS, HOWEVER, EVENTS IN SAN SALVADOR PRACTICALLY RULE OUT ALL HOPES OF SUCCESS FOR FUTURE TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE INSURGENTS. MOREOVER, THE FIGHTING IN THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL, A REUTER CORRESPONDENT BELIEVES, DEALT THE FRAGILE PEACE SETTLEMENT PROCESS IN CENTRAL AMERICA A CONSIDERABLE BLOW.
TST3-MUC4-0062	SAN SALVADOR, 16 NOV 89 -- THAT IS THE POSITION OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT. WITH THE INFORMATION IT HAS, THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT POINT THE FINGER AT ANYONE. IT CANNOT ACCUSE ANYONE YET, BECAUSE THERE IS NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE. WE BELIEVE THERE MAY BE SOME PEOPLE WHO CAN COOPERATE WITH US IF WE HELP THEM. THERE MAY BE SOME WITNESSES, WHO MAY BE WILLING TO COOPERATE, BUT THEY MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW. HE SAID HE WAS WILLING TO HELP. THEY WANTED THE INVESTIGATIONS TO TAKE PLACE. WELL, I BELIEVE MUCH DEPENDS ON THE POSITION OF THE FMLN. I HAVE LISTENED TO SEVERAL VERSIONS ALL THE WAY FROM DEMANDING MY RESIGNATION TO ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS AGAINST ME TO FINISH EVERYTHING UP. UNDER THESE TERMS, THEY ARE SAYING WE ARE ABOUT TO CREATE A NEW LEBANON, AND THEY ARE SAYING THE FMLN HAS CONTROL OVER CERTAIN LIBERATED AREAS IN THE CAPITAL. HOWEVER, IF WE TALKED ABOUT THE SITUATION RATIONALLY AND REASONABLY, THERE COULD BE . WELL, WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE AIR FORCE SITUATION IN THE PAST. THE AIR FORCE HAS ORDERS NOT TO BOMB AND NOT TO USE ITS WEAPONS AGAINST URBAN AREAS OF THE CAPITAL UNLESS IT HAS BEEN ABLE TO DETECT AND ISOLATE A CLEAR FMLN TARGET. IN THIS REGARD, AIR FORCE BOMBS WERE NOT USED UNTIL LAST NIGHT WHEN AIR FORCE PLANES WERE ATTACKED FROM SOME SUGARCANE FIELDS NORTH OF THE 1533 LANDING STRIP ...USE BOMBS TO STOP THE USE OF FMLN MORTARS. THE AIR FORCE USED MACHINEGUNS THE ONLY TIME THEY WERE USED WITHIN THE URBAN AREA, TO BE SURE THEY WERE NOT ENDANGERING ANYONE, WERE TWO MORTARS INSTALLED IN THE SOCCER FIELD OF THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY. ONE WAS FIRED AT THE POLICE BATTALION IN ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD, AND THE OTHER WAS FIRING AT THE 1ST BRIGADE. I BELIEVE THAT AMONG THE WEAPONS THAT WERE SEIZED, THERE ARE SOME OF THAT. I AM NOT TOO SURE. IN THE , NEAR THE SAN JACINTO HILL WERE USED TO SUPPORT TROOPS THAT WERE USING THE SAN JACINTO HILL. WE BELIEVE IT WAS THE FMLN WITHRAWING IN SANTA MARTA. UP TO NOW, THE POSITION OF THE ARMED FORCES STAFF AND THE HIGH COMMAND IN THE USE OF THE AIR FORCE IS ONLY AND WHEN SPECIFIC TARGETS CAN BE ISOLATED IN WHICH THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IS NOT ENDANGERED. I DO NOT HAVE IT WITH ME RIGHT NOW, BUT THERE WILL BE A REPORT ON THE MILITARY SITUATION BY THE HIGH COMMAND TONIGHT.
TST3-MUC4-0063	CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- A FASCIST IDEOLOGY HAS INFILTRATED THE WHITE HOUSE AND NO ONE SHOULD BE SURPRISED BECAUSE IT COINCIDES WITH THE ARENA IDEOLOGY. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THE BOMBINGS AFTER CYNICALLY SAYING IT KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THEM. HOWEVER, THAT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT IS EVEN MORE HAIR-RAISING THAN THE DENIAL. HEAR US WELL: THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS STATED THAT IT SUPPORTS THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS' EFFORTS TO CRUSH THE OFFENSIVE WHICH HAS CAUSED SO MANY PERSONAL TRAGEDIES; AND IT PRAISED THE ARMY FOR DECREEING STRICT LAWS TO PREVENT CIVILIAN CASUALTIES. WE ALSO HEAR THE PET EXPRESSION THAT THE FMLN IS USING CIVILIANS TO PROTECT ITS FIGHTERS, AND THE PRINCIPLE OF REMOVING THE PEOPLE FROM THEIR ENVIRONMENT IS UNSCRUPULOUSLY APPLIED ONCE MORE. THIS IS WHY THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY WAS DESTROYED, LEAVING ENTIRE TOWNS IN RUINS -- AND NOW LARGE AREAS OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST IMPORTANT CITIES ARE BEING DESTROYED. ONE DAY THOSE RUINS WILL BECOME THE EVIDENCE WE WILL SHOW OUR CHILDREN TO PROVE THAT FASCISM ONCE EXISTED IN THE COUNTRY. HOWEVER, THE U.S. IMPERIALISM'S CLUMSINESS GOES EVEN FURTHER. THE NORTH AMERICANS APPARENTLY WANT TO BECOME INVOLVED IN A LARGE-SCALE CONFLICT -- FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW DEATH SQUAD MEMBERS WHO HAVE ALREADY EARNED THE WORLD'S SCORN -- GIVEN THE DECISION TO SEND U.S. PILOTS TO BOMB THE CIVILIAN POPULATION BY NIGHT. THE FASCIST SALVADORAN DICTATORSHIP HAS UNLEASHED THE BRUTAL TACTICS USED BY SOMOZA BEFORE LEAVING POWER. ON THAT OCCASION THE U.S. IMPERIALISM TURNED ITS BACK ON THE TYRANT. THE UNITED STATES' FOREIGN POLICY HAVE NEVER STOOPED SO LOW AND THE DECISIONS ADOPTED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAVE NEVER BROUGHT THE POSSIBILITY OF A REGIONAL CONFLICT SO CLOSE. WHAT DOES THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT THINK ABOUT THE AIRPLANES BEING FLOWN BY U.S. PILOTS ONLY A FEW HUNDRED KM FROM ITS BORDER? WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF GUATEMALA CONTINUES TO INVOLVE ITSELF IN THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT? THE CONSEQUENCES ARE UNFORESEEABLE. THE U.S. IMPERIALISM HAS SOILED ITS HANDS WITH A NEW GENOCIDE IN EL SALVADOR. THE U.S. PEOPLE SHOULD DEEPLY REFLECT ABOUT THIS AND STOP THEIR GOVERNMENT FROM PROVOKING CONTEMPT OF THAT NATION -- WHICH IS BEING DISINFORMED AND INTOXICATED BY THE ANTI-COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA. LARGE GROUPS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S PEOPLE, THE BEST SONS OF THE UNITED STATES, HAVE REACTED AND HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS --DEEP INSIDE THE U.S. IMPERIALISM'S HEART. SOON, VERY SOON, THIS WILL BECOME AN UNSTOPPABLE SURGE. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGIC GOAL IS CLEAR: THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WANTS THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO . TO QUOTE MONSIGNOR ROMERO, THE ARMY -- AND IN THIS CASE THE NORTH AMERICANS -- ARE LIKE SERPENTS, WHICH ONLY BITE THE SHOELESS. YET THEY DO NOT KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE RISEN IN ANGER AND DIGNITY, AND THEY ARE COMING TO PULL OUT THE FASCIST SERPENT'S FANGS.
TST3-MUC4-0064	SAN SALVADOR, 18 NOV 89 -- THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES AND SECURITY CORPS HAVE INFLICTED THE FOLLOWING CASUALTIES ON THE ENEMY: 784 DEAD, 357 WOUNDED. THE ARMED FORCES ALSO SEIZED THE FOLLOWING EQUIPMENT: 376 RIFLES, 3 CARBINES, 11 SHOTGUNS, 83 ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 26 MORTARS, 8 MACHINEGUNS, 17 SUBMACHINEGUNS, 31 PISTOLS, 17 RADIOS. THIS HAS BEEN A REPORT ON THE CASUALTIES INFLICTED BY OUR GLORIOUS ARMED FORCES ON THE FMLN CRIMINAL TERRORISTS. THE REPORT INCLUDED THE WAR MATERIEL SEIZED IN THE LAST FEW HOURS FROM THE FMLN COMMUNISTS.
TST3-MUC4-0065	BURGOS , 19 NOV 89 -- APPROXIMATELY 1,000 PEOPLE DEMONSTRATED TODAY AT THE BURGOS MAIN SQUARE TO ASK THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT TO MEDIATE IN THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT, AND IN BARCELONA , A DEMONSTRATION TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAS BEEN SCHEDULED FOR 22 NOVEMBER. THE DEMONSTRATORS, CONVOKED BY THE SOLIDARITY WITH LATIN AMERICA COMMITTEE, VERBALLY ATTACKED SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND HAVE ASKED THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT TO OFFER ITSELF AS A MEDIATOR TO PROMOTE AN END THE ARMED CONFLICT. SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ATTENDED THE DEMONSTRATION, WHICH WAS HELD WITHOUT INCIDENTS, CARRIED PLACARTS DENOUNCING THE KILLING OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS -- FIVE OF WHOM WERE SPANISH CITIZENS -- AND TWO SALVADORAN WOMEN AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY. MEANWHILE, CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS, STUDENT ASSOCIATIONS, LABOR UNIONS, AND POLITICAL PARTIES IN CATALUNA HAVE SCHEDULED A DEMONSTRATION IN SUPPORT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO BE HELD IN BARCELONA ON 22 NOVEMBER. THESE ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH HAVE FORMED AN EMERGENCY COMMITTEE, HAVE OPENED AN ACCOUNT AT THE "LA CAIXA" SAVINGS BANK WHERE ECONOMIC DONATIONS ARE BEING ACCEPTED TO HELP THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. IN A MANIFESTO RELEASED, THE COMMITTEE DEMANDS AN END TO THE BOMBING OF CIVILIANS, THE IMMEDIATE EVACUATION OF THE WOUNDED, AND AN END TO ATTACKS AGAINST THE UNION HEADQUARTERS AND LEADERS. LIKEWISE, THE COMMITTEE HAS DEMANDED AN END TO U.S. INTERVENTION IN EL SALVADOR AND THAT THE GUATEMALAN AND HONDURAN ARMIES REFRAIN FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE CONFLICT. "WE ASK THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS AND THE EEC TO PRESSURE THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT TO BEGIN A REAL NEGOTIATION THAT WILL AN END TO THE CONFLICT AND ITS CAUSES, THE MANIFESTO STATES.
TST3-MUC4-0066	GUATEMALA CITY, 19 NOV 89 -- PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO HAS TACITLY BLAMED PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S ADMINISTRATION FOR THE CRISIS WHICH PREVAILS IN THE COUNTRY AS A RESULT OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S OFFENSIVE WHICH WAS LAUNCHED ON SATURDAY 11 NOVEMBER. CEREZO ATTENDED THE CONCLUSION OF A SEMINAR SPONSORED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR POLITICAL STUDIES ON 17 NOVEMBER. THE EVENT WAS HELD AT 2100 AT THE GUATEMALA FIESTA HOTEL. THE NEW CENTRAL AMERICAN VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATION OF AMERICA WAS SWORN IN AT THE EVENT. CARLOS MORALES EHRLICH, OF EL SALVADOR, WAS REPLACED BY PROFESSOR CATALINA SOBERANIS, OF GUATEMALA. DURING HIS SPEECH MORALES EHRLICH BLAMED THE EXTREME RIGHT DEATH SQUADS OF EL SALVADOR FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY. DURING HIS SPEECH, WHICH WAS MORE LIKE AN INFORMAL CHAT, PRESIDENT CEREZO ATTRIBUTED THE SITUATION WHICH PREVAILS IN EL SALVADOR TO PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S INEFFICIENCY.
TST3-MUC4-0067	CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- HEAVY CLASHES ARE TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW IN ESCALON AND SAN BENITO RESIDENTIAL AREAS. THERE IS NO GOING BACK. WE HAVE BROKEN THE DEFENSIVE LINES OF THE ENEMY. WE HAVE BROKEN IN THE CAPITAL CITY, WE ARE FIGHTING IN FRONT OF THE DENS OF COLONEL PONCE AND OTHER OFFICERS WHO HAVE TURNED THE WAR INTO A BUSINESS. THOSE OFFICERS HAVE LUXURIOUS MANSIONS IN MIAMI. EVERY WEEKEND AND EVEN IN SPITE OF THE WAR, COL PONCE HAS ORGIES IN HIS LUXURIOUS HOMES IN THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR. SOLDIERS, PATRIOTIC OFFICERS, WE CALL ON YOU TO JOIN THE PEOPLE AND JOIN OUR FRONT. PATRIOTIC OFFICERS, WHO ARE LISTENING TO US, DO NOT ALLOW MORE BOMBINGS IN OUR CAPITAL CITY BY THE GENOCIDAL TANDONA GROUP . YOUNG OFFICERS, LIEUTENANTS WHO ARE BEING KILLED IN THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS AND NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE CAPITAL CITY, WHY SHOULD YOU BE KILLED WHILE DEFENDING PONCE'S MANSIONS? THIS IS THE LAST SCENARIO OF THE LAST CHAPTER IN WHICH THE FMLN WILL ACHIEVE THE VICTORY OF THE PEOPLE. WE CALL ON YOUR CONSCIENCE, YOUNG PATRIOTIC OFFICER. JUST LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BOMBINGS OF ZACAMIL. OVER 500 HOMES WERE RAZED. ARE YOU GOING TO ALLOW THE HIGH COMMAND TO FINISH OFF THE CITY, TO FINISH OFF THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS WHERE YOUR RELATIVES MIGHT BE? YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN ZACAMIL, MEJICANOS, SOYAPANGO. PATRIOTIC OFFICER, IT IS TIME WE SIT DOWN TO TALK, TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO WITH OUR FATHERLAND, AND WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH LA TANDONA. PATRIOTIC OFFICERS WHO ARE LISTENING TO US: IT IS USELESS TO CONTINUE DEFENDING; TO CONTINUE DEFENDING WHAT, WE ASK YOU. THE FATHERLAND? WHAT FATHERLAND? THE FATHERLAND YOU ARE TOLD YOU ARE DEFENDING ARE THE MILLIONS AND THE MANSIONS OF COL PONCE AND OF COL ELENA FUENTES. PATRIOTIC OFFICERS: THE TIME IS HERE, TAKE ONE STEP FORWARD. WE HAVE MORE REPORTS FROM SAN SALVADOR: EARLY THIS MORNING, COMBAT HAS BEEN RESUMED IN THE FOLLOWING PLACES: ESCALON, SAN BENITO, AND LA SULTANA RESIDENTIAL AREAS. THESE ATTACKS ARE AGAINST THE SOLDIERS FROM MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 6 AND THE CAVALRY. COMBATS ARE ALSO REPORTED NORTH OF AYUTUXTEPEQUE, AGAINST SOLDIERS FROM THE 4TH AND 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE. THERE ARE ALSO CLASHES IN THE AREA OF METROPOLIS AND ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOODS AGAINST SOLDIERS FROM THE BRACAMONTE BATTALION. IT IS IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT IN SAN BENITO AND LA SULTANA RESIDENTIAL AREAS, WE ARE FIGHTING AGAINST SOLDIERS FROM SONSONATE, AND NOT FROM SAN SALVADOR. THE SOLDIERS ARE FROM MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 6 OF SONSONATE. TROOPS FROM SONSONATE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INTO SAN SALVADOR, BECAUSE THE HIGH COMMAND HAS LOST CONTROL OF THE SITUATION. IN OTHER WORDS, THERE IS A MIXTURE OF SOLDIERS FROM ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY IN THE CAPITAL CITY. THIS HAS YIELDED NEGATIVE RESULTS FOR THE HIGH COMMAND. IN THE CAPITAL CITY, THERE HAVE BEEN CLASHES BETWEEN THE ATLACATL BATTALION AND THE NATIONAL POLICE, AND THE NATIONAL GUARD HAS ATTACKED TROOPS FROM MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 6. THESE ARE LITTLE SOLDIERS FROM SONSONATE WHO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE CAPITAL CITY, AND THEY ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE CITY. THEY ARE CLASHING AGAINST EACH OTHER. CLASHES ARE ALSO REPORTED WITH THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE AND THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE. IN OTHER WORDS, THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE IS FIGHTING IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY? THE GARRISONS HAVE BEEN LEFT EMPTY. THE SAN FRANCISCO GOTERA GARRISON HAS BEEN LEFT WITHOUT ANYONE. THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE IS BEING LEFT BY ITSELF, AS WELL AS THE MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 1. THE COLONELS ARE DESPERATE AND ARE BRINGING TROOPS INTO THE CAPITAL CITY. THIS IS A GOOD REPORT. THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE AND MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 6 ARE IN THE CAPITAL. THIS IS THE SITUATION ON THIS MORNING OF VICTORIOUS BATTLES. WHO WOULD BELIEVE IT? THE SONSONATE SOLDIERS ARE FIGHTING IN THE CAPITAL CITY. THIS GIVES US A GENERAL PICTURE OF THE DEFEAT. IF THE SONSONATE TROOPS ARE FIGHTING IN THE LAST DEFENSIVE LINE, THIS MEANS THAT THE SONSONATE LINES HAVE BEEN WIPED OUT. ATTENTION, FMLN ANTIAIRCRAFT UNITS HAVE OPENED FIRE WITH THEIR M-60 MACHINEGUNS AGAINST UH-1H HELICOPTERS THAT ARE FLYING OVER THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS OF THE OLIGARCHY. LIKEWISE, A HELICOPTER IS RIGHT NOW FLYING OVER THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF OFFICES. FMLN UNITS ARE FIRING THEIR ANTI-AIRCRAFT WEAPONS IN THE ESCALON RESIDENTIAL AREA.
TST3-MUC4-0068	SAN SALVADOR, 21 NOV 89 -- THE REBEL COMMANDERS WHO DIRECTED THE OCCUPATION OF SEVERAL SAN SALVADOR NEIGHBORHOODS LAST WEEK, TODAY HEADED THE SEIZURE OF THE SHERATON HOTEL, WHERE OAS SECRETARY GENERAL JOAO BAENA SOARES WAS TRAPPED FOR MORE THAN 8 HOURS. NEWSMEN WHO ENTERED THE HOTEL THIS AFTERNOON DURING THE EVACUATION OF BAENA BY DIPLOMATS WERE ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT COMMANDER AMILCAR, KNOWN AS "EL CHOCO," WHO DIRECTED THE COMBAT OPERATIONS IN THE ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD, WAS SEEN TODAY ON THE THIRD FLOOR OF THE SHERATON HOTEL. SEVERAL REBELS HAVE SAID THAT FACUNDO GUARDADO , ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT AND ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE OFFENSIVE THAT BEGAN IN THE CAPITAL ON 11 NOVEMBER, IS SOMEWHERE NEAR THE HOTEL. ACCORDING TO THE REBELS, GUARDADO EXPECTED TO INITIATE THIS AFTERNOON'S "NEGOTIATIONS" WITH THE MANAGER OF THE HOTEL, ROBERT NEWELL. SEVERAL U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS, AS WELL AS ONE FROM GUATEMALA AND ANOTHER ONE FROM CHILE REMAIN IN THE HANDS OF THE REBELS. EL CHOCO SAID: "WE CAN RESIST FOR AS LONG AS WE HAVE TO. ALL THEY CAN DO IS BOMB THE PLACE AND LET US SEE IF THEY ARE WILLING TO DO THAT." ACCORDING TO THE YOUNG GUERRILLA COMMANDER, THE REBEL WITHDRAWAL FROM THE ZACAMIL, CUSCATANCINGO, AND MEJICANOS NEIGHBORHOODS, AMONG OTHERS, "WAS PART OF THE PLAN" THAT WAS COMPLETED TODAY WITH THE ARRIVAL AT THE SHERATON HOTEL AREA. THE REBEL SAID: "WE HAVE COME HERE TODAY, TO THE ESCALON COLONY, TO THEIR AREA, THE AREA OF THE BOURGEOISIE, TO SEE IF THEY DO HERE WHAT THEY DID WITH THE PEOPLE, WHO WERE HURT BY THE AIR FORCE BOMBING OPERATIONS." AT 0430 TODAY, THE FMLN GUERRILLAS INITIATED HEAVY FIGHTING AROUND THE SHERATON HOTEL, WHERE OAS SECRETARY GENERAL JOAO BAENA SOARES WAS STAYING. BAENA SOARES WAS EVACUATED FROM THE SHERATON HOTEL TO THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMED FORCES STAFF WHERE HE MET WITH THE "HIGHEST SALVADORAN AUTHORITIES," ACCORDING TO DIPLOMATIC AND MILITARY SOURCES. THIS AFTERNOON, THE GUERRILLAS ARE STILL OCCUPYING SEVERAL FLOORS OF THE HOTEL, WHICH HAS BULLET HOLES, DESTROYED WINDOWS, AND BROKEN FURNITURE ALL OVER THE FLOOR. THE AREA HAS BEEN SURROUNDED BY LIGHT ARMORED TANKS AND IS BEING PATROLLED BY SEVERAL ARMED SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS.
TST3-MUC4-0069	HAVANA , 22 NOV 89 -- THE PICTURE PUBLISHED TODAY BY THE NEWSPAPER GRANMA IN ITS THIRD EDITION SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. IN FACT, AS THE NEWSPAPER SUGGESTS, THE YANKEE HAND IS TODAY IN EL SALVADOR AS IT WAS YESTERDAY IN VIETNAM. THE WOUNDED MOTHER WHO TRIES TO COMFORT HER DAUGHTER, A VICTIM OF THE BOMBINGS, IS NOT AN ISOLATED PICTURE. IT IS A SYMBOL OF THE CRIMES THAT ARE BEING COMMITTED AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN THAT COUNTRY. THE UNITED STATES IS NOT INNOCENT OF THESE CRIMES BECAUSE U.S. PILOTS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE MASSACRE. IN THE MEANTIME, WHAT IS THE HUMAN RIGHTS CHAMPION DOING? IN FACT, HE IS DOING NOTHING THAT COULD NOT BE PREDICTED. PRESIDENT BUSH GETS ON THE PHONE AND CALLS HIS SALVADORAN CRONY ALFREDO CRISTINI TO ASSURE HIM THAT EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT, THAT HE CAN GO ON, THAT THE U.S. POSITION IS FAVORABLE TO HIS REGIME. THE HUMAN RIGHTS CHAMPION ASKS NO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RECENT BRUTAL KILLINGS OF UNION LEADERS BY THE ARMY. BUSH ASKS NO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MASSACRE OF SPANISH PRIESTS. THE PRESIDENT ONLY PRAISES THE ARMY, THE AIR FORCE, THE POLICE AND PARAMILITARY EFFORTS TO STOP THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE. BUSH AND CRISTIANI COULD NOT FAIL TO MENTION THE TRITE SLOGAN OF THE CUBAN AND NICARAGUAN AID TO THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS. NOR DID BUSH FAIL TO EXPRESS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S SOLIDARITY. BUT, SOLIDARITY WITH WHOM? ALL WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT UP TO NOW ARE THE PROTESTS PROVOKED IN THE UNITED STATES BY THE U.S. MILITARY AID TO THE SALVADORAN REGIME. THE ONLY REALITIES ARE THE DEMONSTRATIONS STAGED FROM LOS ANGELES TO NEW YORK TO REPUDIATE THE U.S. AID. THE ONLY FACT IS THAT THE HUMAN RIGHTS CHAMPION IS BEING PUBLICLY QUESTIONED ABOUT THIS AID. THE ONLY PICTURE THAT HAS BEEN DISSEMINATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD IS THAT OF A WOMAN WHO INTERRUPTS BUSH'S SPEECH TO SHOUT TO HIM: WHY ARE WE SENDING MONEY TO EL SALVADOR? WHY ARE WE KILLING PRIESTS IN EL SALVADOR? IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO OVERLOOK THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY IN THE CURRENT SALVADORAN SITUATION. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST BE AWARE OF THIS REALITY AND MUST ACT ACCORDINGLY.
TST3-MUC4-0070	SAN SALVADOR, 26 NOV 89 -- ...THAT THE FMLN LAUNCHED AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ON 11 NOVEMBER. THE FMLN LAUNCHED THIS AGGRESSION WITH ALL OF ITS FORCES, CHIEFLY USING A CONCENTRATION OF WEAPONS AND FIGHTERS IN THE SAN SALVADOR METROPOLITAN ZONE, IN ZACATECOLUCA, LA PAZ DEPARTMENT, AND AT TIMES IN USULUTAN CITY, USULUTAN DEPARMENT, AND IN SAN MIGUEL CITY, SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT. IN THIS AGGRESSION THE FMLN DISPLAYED ITS WEAPONRY. IT DISPLAYED AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WEAPONS, WHICH.... BY THE WAY, IN RECENT DAYS THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAVE BEGUN A NUMBER OF SEARCHES IN SOME HOUSES WHERE IT IS BELIEVED THAT SOME OF THESE WEAPONS WERE LOCATED. WE HAVE ALREADY FOUND LARGE AMOUNTS OF WEAPONS. IN ADDITION, THE FMLN LAUNCHED AN AGGRESSION AND HID BEHIND YOU, SALVADORAN PEOPLE. IT USED YOU AS A SHIELD, WANTING TO CONVEY THE IDEA THAT THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THAT THE PEOPLE HERE WOULD RISE UP TO SUPPORT THEM. THEY HAVE REALIZED THAT THIS VIEW IS TOTALLY FALSE. FAR FROM SUPPORTING THE FMLN, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, SALVADORAN BROTHERS, SUPPORTED THE ARMED FORCES IN THE TREMENDOUS EFFORT IT HAS CONDUCTED TO REPEL THE FMLN AGGRESSION. HOWEVER, WE MUST NOW CONSIDER A VERY IMPORTANT MATTER. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT AN AGGRESSION OF THIS SIZE WITHOUT SUPPORT FROM SOMEONE ABROAD. ON THIS OCCASION, WE ARE CERTAIN THAT THIS SUPPORT CAME FROM NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT ORTEGA AND CUBAN PRESIDENT CASTRO, BUT CHIEFLY FROM ORTEGA WHO IS TRYING TO RAISE A SMOKESCREEN IN THE FACE OF THE REAL POSSIBILITY THAT MRS VIOLETTA CHAMORRO MAY DEFEAT HIM IN THE ELECTIONS, AND BECAUSE THE FMLN HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE PUPPET OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNIST AGGRESSION IN WHICH ORTEGA AND CASTRO PARTICIPATE. IF THIS IS NOT SO, LET US TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED. DURING THOSE TIMES WHEN YOU WERE SUFFERING MOMENTS OF ANGUISH LAST WEEK, YOU WERE ABLE TO SEE THE LARGE NUMBER OF FOREIGNERS WHO WERE SUPPORTING THE FMLN TERRORISTS. WE HAVE ALSO MANAGED TO COLLECT EVIDENCE THAT THE ORTEGA GOVERNMENT TRAINED FMLN FIGHTERS IN THE USE OF CERTAIN KINDS OF WEAPONRY, SPECIFICALLY THE GRENADE LAUNCHERS. WHAT HAPPENED? IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS WE BEGAN NOTICING WHAT KIND OF WEAPONS WERE BEING USED. IN THE FOILED ATTACK ON THE PRESIDENTIAL HOUSE, A SUBSEQUENT ATTACK ON THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES' JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, AND LASTLY, AN ATTACK ON THE NATIONAL GUARD GARRISON PARTICULAR KINDS OF WEAPONS WERE BEING USED. AS A RESULT OF THE SAVAGE ACTION BY FMLN, TWO LITTLE GIRLS WERE KILLED. MOREOVER, LET US RECALL AND SEE THE CONNECTION THAT EXISTS WITH ALL THE SHIPMENTS THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN STOPPING BETWEEN NICARAGUAN AND EL SALVADOR. ONE SHIPMENT WAS MADE PRIOR TO THE VISIT WE PRESIDENTS MADE TO COSTA RICA. IN THAT COUNTRY, WE DENOUNCED ORTEGA FOR CONTINUING TO SEND WEAPONS AND SUPPORTING THE FMLN IN AN OPEN VIOLATION OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PROCESS. AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED LATELY? ON 25 NOVEMBER, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, TWO LIGHT AIRPLANES COMING FROM NICARAGUA WERE DISCOVERED. THEIR FLIGHT COURSE INDICATES THAT THEY CAME FROM NICARAGUA, ESPECIALLY THE ONE WHERE THE WEAPONS WERE FOUND. AS ADDITIONAL PROOF, WE HAVE A DOCUMENT SHOWING THAT ONE LIGHT AIRCRAFT BELONGS TO THE SETA TRANSPORTATION COMPANY LOCATED IN NICARAGUA'S AUGUSTO CESAR SANDINO AIRPORT. IT WAS BRINGING SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT FOR THE FMLN. IN THAT AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT, FOUR PEOPLE WERE KILLED: THE PILOT WHO WAS WEARING CIVILIAN CLOTHES AND THREE OTHER PEOPLE WERE WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS; I MEAN CAMOUFLAGE UNIFORMS LIKE THE ONES WORN IN MANY COUNTRIES, AND LIKE THE ONES THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCE USE. IT IS BELIEVED THAT TWO OF THOSE PEOPLE DIED AS A RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT ANOTHER PERSON KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE HAD A WEAPON IN HIS HAND AND A BULLET WOUND IN FOREHEAD. HE KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE SAW HIMSELF IMPLICATED IN THIS SITUATION.
TST3-MUC4-0071	CLANDESTINE, 29 NOV 89 -- OUR FMLN FORCES HAVE TAKEN OVER BUNKERS FROM THE VARIOUS MILITARY CHIEFS IN ESCALON AND MANUEL JOSE ARCE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE OUR UNITS SEIZED THOUSANDS OF CARTRIDGES, RIFLES, GRENADES, AND OTHER TYPES OF ARMS WHICH THESE MILITARY CHIEFS USUALLY STORE IN THE BUNKERS THAT THEY MAINTAIN IN THESE RESIDENTIAL SECTORS. AS WE HAVE REPORTED, THE GENERAL STAFF RESPONDED WITH A 4-PRONGED DELAYED RESPONSE. THE ARMED FORCES ATTACKED FROM FOUR ADVANCED POSITIONS, ONE HELD BY THE BRACAMONTE BATTALION, WHICH ADVANCED TOWARD ESCALON; IT WAS NEUTRALIZED BY OUR AMBUSHES. OUR UNITS ARE ENTRENCHED IN THE MANSIONS OF THE OLIGARCHS IN THAT SECTOR OF ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD. THEY AMBUSHED AND REPELLED ATTACKS FROM THE VANGUARD POSITIONS LAUNCHED BY THE ARMED FORCES. THE SECOND DIRECTION IN WHICH THE ENEMY RESPONDED TO OUR PRESENCE WAS DIRECTED ON THE SOUTHERN FREEWAY. THIS SECOND POSITION WAS AMBUSHED WITH RPG-7 ROCKET LAUNCHERS AND MACHINEGUN FIRE. THE THIRD ENEMY POSITION, WHICH WAS ADVANCING ON SANTA TECLA, WAS AMBUSHED AT LA UNIVERSAL POINT AND WAS ALSO NEUTRALIZED. THE ATLACATL BATTALION DEPLOYMENT ALONG GUADALUPE GARDENS WAS ALSO NEUTRALIZED. OUR BATTALIONS ARE STAGING SABOTAGE ACTIONS ON ELECTRICITY POSTS IN THE ESCALON AND SAN BENITO NEIGHBORHOODS. ALSO, WE HAVE A NEW REPORT WHICH INDICATES THAT FMLN UNITS HAVE SET UP DOWNED ELECTRICITY POSTS AS BARRICADES ALONG THE SOUTH FREEWAY AND IN THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD. WE REPEAT, ALONG THE SOUTH FREEWAY AND IN THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD, FMLN UNITS HAVE USED DOWNED ELECTRICITY POSTS AND VEHICLES AS BARRICADES. THIS IS THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR. THROUGHOUT THE NORTHERN SECTOR OF THE CAPITAL, OUR UNITS ARE MAINTAINING POSITIONS. THE TROOPS IN THE INTERIOR PART OF THE REPUBLIC IN THAT NORTHERN REGION REFUSE TO ADVANCE TOWARD OUR POSITIONS, WHILE OUR UNITS ARE EXTENDING ALONG THE NORTHWESTERN AND SOUTHWESTERN REGION OF THE CAPITAL. OUR UNITS ARE EXTENDING AND MOVING FOWARD ALONG THESE ZONES. THE AIR FORCE HAS OPENED FIRE ON SOME OF OUR POSITIONS IN THE ESCALON AND SAN BENITO NEIGHBORHOODS. WE REITERATE THE CALL TO THE INHABITANTS OF THE ESCALON AND SAN BENITO NEIGHBORHOODS TO ABANDON ALL THOSE ZONES IMMEDIATELY. THE AIR FORCE IS BEGINNING NEW AIR RAIDS ON FMLN POSITIONS IN THOSE REGIONS. THEREFORE, WE CALL ON THE INHABITANTS OF THE ESCALON AND SAN BENITO NEIGHBORHOODS TO LEAVE THOSE AREAS.
TST3-MUC4-0072	MANAGUA , 1 DEC 89 -- LA PRENSA NEWSPAPER TODAY REPORTED THAT THE SANDINISTS DID SEND A PLANE TO EL SALVADOR. THE AIRCRAFT IS A CESSNA 310. THE IDENTITY OF THE CREWMEN IN THE NICARAGUAN PLANES THAT CRASHED IN EL SALVADOR OVER THE PAST WEEKEND CARRYING SOVIET ARMS IS A STATE SECRET ACCEDED TO BY LA PRENSA THIS MORNING AFTER GETTING IN TOUCH WITH A HIGH-RANKING SOURCE IN THE SANDINIST ARMY. THE SOURCE DISCLOSED FURTHER DETAILS OF THE BUTTERFLY OPERATION. THE ARMY SOURCE, WHICH OF COURSE REQUESTED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS, CONFIRMED THAT THE PLANE THAT CRASHED IN SAN MIGUEL BELONGS TO NICARAGUA AND THAT THE PLANE'S REGISTRATION IS YANKEE NOVEMBER BRAVO YANKEE KILO. THERE ARE NO REPORTS SO FAR AS TO WHETHER ANY RELATIVES HAVE CLAIMED THE BODIES OF THE FOUR MILITARY MEN WHO WERE REPORTEDLY KILLED WHEN THE PLANE CRASHED. THREE OF THE CREWMEN WERE KILLED INSTANTLY, WHILE THE FOURTH COMMITTED SUICIDE. A PICTURE OF A YOUNG CUBAN GIRL, DATED IN JULY, IS THE ONLY PUBLISHED CLUE AS TO THE IDENTITY OF THE MEN, WHETHER NICARAGUANS, CUBANS, OR SALVADORANS, COMMISSIONED FOR THIS CLANDESTINE MISSION DIRECTED FROM NICARAGUA. OUR SOURCE SAID THAT YOUNG SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS WERE TRAINED AT THE NATIONAL CIVILIAN FLIGHT SCHOOL OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS. THE TRAINING WAS SUPERVISED BY CAPTAIN ROBIN ROMERO, THE FLIGHT SCHOOL'S DIRECTOR. THE TRAINING WAS ALSO CONDUCTED AT PUNTA HUETE AND LOS BRASILES. MOST OF THE FLIGHTS WERE MADE AT NIGHT. THE STUDENT PILOTS USED OIL LAMPS AS LANDING LIGHTS. THE SOURCE SAID THE TRAINING FLIGHTS WERE CONDUCTED IN LIGHT SINGLE-ENGINE PLANES FROM SANDINO AIRPORT TO PUNTA HUETE OR LOS BRASILES. THE HEAD OF THIS OPERATION WAS COMMANDER CHRISTIAN PICHARDO. IN THE OPERATION ALSO PARTICIPATED TWO SALVADORAN GUERRILLA COMMANDERS WHOSE IDENTITIES ARE UNKNOWN. THE CESSNA 310 HAD BEEN LEASED BY THE NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT BANK , WHICH IN TURN HAD ACQUIRED THE PLANE FROM THE ZETA NATIONAL CHARTER SERVICE, AN AERONICA SUBSIDIARY. BND ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR MARCOS BLANDON GRAVY LEASED THE PLANE, ONE OF SEVERAL AIRCRAFT INTENDED TO BE SENT TO EL SALVADOR. ANOTHER SINGLE-ENGINE CESSNA, WITH REGISTRATION CHARLIE BRAVO PAPA, AND AN AERO COMMANDER, WERE ADDED TO THE INVENTORY. ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCE, THE AERO COMMANDER WAS CONFISCATED FROM COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN PUERTO CABEZAS A YEAR AGO WHEN THEY WERE INTERCEPTED BY SANDINIST AIR FORCE PLANES. THE PLANES INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION, HOWEVER, REMAINED UNEQUIPPED TO FLY TO EL SALVADOR UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.
TST3-MUC4-0073	BOGOTA, 6 DEC 89 -- A POWERFUL BOMB HIDDEN IN A TRUCK EXPLODED OUTSIDE THE HEADQUARTERS OF COLOMBIA'S SECRET POLICE WEDNESDAY, CAUSING SEVERE DAMAGE, BOGOTA MAYOR ANDRES PASTRANA SAID. EARLY REPORTS SAID SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND INJURED. MR. PASTRANA SAID THE BOMB EXPLODED OUTSIDE THE BUILDING OF THE SECRET POLICE, KNOWN FROM THE SPANISH INITIALS AS DAS , IN WESTERN BOGOTA AT 7:35 A.M. THE NEARBY OFFICES OF THE BOGOTA TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT WERE ALSO DAMAGED, HE SAID.
TST3-MUC4-0074	SAN SALVADOR, 6 DEC 89 -- THE TREASURY POLICE HAVE INFORMED THIS NETWORK THAT TERRORIST ALBERTO CHICA FERNANDEZ, A LEADER IN THE LABOR UNION, CONFESSED THAT THE FMLN TERRORIST LEADERS MAY INITIATE SUMMARY ACTIONS WITH A VIEW TO PURGING THE LEADERS OF LEFTIST GROUPS BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE OF THE SO-CALLED "FINAL OFFENSIVE TO THE END." CHICA SAID THAT THE TERRORIST LEADERSHIP HAS VIOLENTLY HUMBERTO CENTENO, MARCO TULIO LIMA, AND AN INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFIED ONLY AS JULIO CESAR, FROM THE UNTS , AS WELL AS OTHER LEFTIST LEADERS, FOR PROVIDING FALSE INFORMATION REGARDING THE CONDITIONS FOR A POPULAR INSURRECTION. ACCORDING TO CHICA, THE FMLN LEADERS IN MANAGUA DECIDED TO LAUNCH THE OFFENSIVE, TRUSTING THE UNTS LEADERS' REPORTS THAT CONDITIONS WERE RIGHT FOR AN INSURRECTION BECAUSE FEBE ELIZABETH VELAZQUEZ' DEATH IN THE DYNAMITE ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS HAD IGNITED THE PEOPLE'S SPIRITS. THE PRISONER SAID THAT THE FMLN MAY CARRY OUT A SUMMARY TRIAL IN THE STYLE OF COMMUNIST PARTIES AGAINST THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAILURE. NOW, HE SAID, TO SAVE THEMSELVES FROM THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HAVING DECEIVED THE TERRORIST CRIMINALS WHO ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE LED BY LIES, THE UNTS LEADERS ARE EXPECTED TO CALL NEWS CONFERENCES TO ANNOUNCE THAT THEIR STRUGGLE CONTINUES. MEANWHILE, A REPORT FROM ZACATECOLUCA, LA PAZ DEPARTMENT, INDICATES THAT FMLN TERRORIST CRIMINALS, USING SAM-7 MISSILES, ATTACKED A SALVADORAN AIR FORCE 0-2 AIRPLANE WHICH WAS IN THE AREA DIRECTING SUPPORT NEAR PIEDRA GRANDE ABAJO IN THE JURISDICTION OF ZACATECOLUCA. NO DAMAGES OR CASUALTIES WERE REPORTED. ANOTHER FMLN MISSILE WAS FIRED FROM LAS PIEDRAS HILL, IN THE SAME AREA, AGAINST ANOTHER SALVADORAN AIR FORCE 0-2 AIRPLANE, BUT THE AIRPLANE WAS NOT DAMAGED. THE SOURCE SAYS THE MISSILE EXPLODED IN THE AIR OVER ZACATECOLUCA. THE AIR FORCE, TO WHICH EXPERIENCED PILOTS LEND THEIR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, IS ADMIRED BY THE PEOPLE, WHO ARE GRATEFUL TO THEIR ARMED FORCES.
TST3-MUC4-0075	SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE -- MARCO ANTONIO GUEVARA, OF THE "UP TO DATE" NEWSCAST. HOW DO THE FIVE PRESIDENTS CONCEIVE THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE FMLN? HOW DOES THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT CONCEIVE THIS HAPPENING? I BELIEVE THERE HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN THIS PRESIDENTIAL MEETING AS COMPARED TO PREVIOUS MEETINGS. TO EXPLAIN THIS BETTER, MARCO ANTONIO, WE MUST SAY WE WILL NOT FALL INTO WHAT HAS BEEN USED IN THE PAST, THAT IS, THE FAMOUS SYMMETRY. ON THIS OCCASION, WE HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR AND CATEGORICAL WHEN WE SAID THAT WE WERE NOT WILLING TO CONTINUE CONTRIBUTING SACRIFICES AND OTHER THINGS FROM THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO SOLVE THE NICARAGUAN PROBLEM EXCLUSIVELY. WE DEMANDED UNIFORMITY, AND ANY OTHER COUNTRY CONFRONTING THE AGGRESSION OF AN IRREGULAR FORCE -- ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN CENTRAL AMERICA -- ALSO HAS THE RIGHT TO BE TREATED IN A UNIFORM MANNER, AS FAR AS MEASURES AND CRITERIA THAT MAY BE ADOPTED IN THE PRESIDENTIAL MEETINGS. THAT IS WHY TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU ARE SEEING HOW THE MEASURES ADOPTED FOR THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE -- THAT HAD BEEN GRANTED MOST OF THE ATTENTION UP TO NOW -- ARE ALSO BEING ADOPTED FOR THE FMLN. WE CANNOT ALLOW A COUNTRY TO CLAIM IT IS THE ONLY TARGET OF AN AGGRESSION BY AN IRREGULAR ARMED FORCE SUPPORTED FROM ABROAD. HERE IN EL SALVADOR WE NOW HAVE GREATER EVIDENCE FOLLOWING THIS 11 NOVEMBER TERRORIST AGGRESSION THAT THE FMLN IS A MOVEMENT THAT CAN SURVIVE ONLY WITH SUPPORT FROM ABROAD, AND THAT IT OBEYS AND EXISTS BECAUSE OF INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENTS. IN THE SECOND PLACE, IT HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT IT ONLY HAS THE CAPACITY TO GENERATE TERRORISM, WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED IN THIS DOCUMENT. WE CANNOT CONTINUE JUST TALKING ABOUT DEMOBILIZATION AND PACIFICATION IN NICARAGUA. IT IS TIME TO APPLY THIS TO ALL IRREGULAR GROUPS, BE IT THE URNG IN GUATEMALA, OR ANY OTHER IRREGULAR ARMED GROUP THAT MAY COME UP AND MAY TRY TO HINDER THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THE AREA. WE SEE THIS AS SOMETHING THAT HAS GONE DEEP INTO THE MINDS OF ALL THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, AND FROM NOW ON, WE WILL HAVE GREATER UNIFORMITY IN TREATING ALL OF THOSE IRREGULAR GROUPS THAT OPERATE IN THE REGION. RENE HURTADO OF EL MUNDO. MR PRESIDENT, FOLLOWING THE TELA AND COSTA DEL SOL MEETINGS, NICARAGUA HAS CHANGED ITS STAND. IN COSTA RICA, PRESIDENT ORTEGA WAS ASKED IF HE HAD SOLD OUT THE FMLN IN EXCHANGE FOR THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE CONTRAS AND OTHER RESULTS OF THE SUMMIT IN FAVOR OF NICARAGUA. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR OPINION ABOUT THIS, AND ALSO HOW YOU INTERPRET THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT ORTEGA HAS ACCEPTED SOME ISSUES ABOUT THE FMLN THAT HE DID NOT ALLOW IN TELA OR COSTA DEL SOL? ON THE OTHER HAND, WILL THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE FMLN BE THE RESULT OF A DIALOGUE OR NEGOTIATIONS LATER ON? IN THE FIRST PLACE, I BELIEVE THAT DANIEL ORTEGA WAS UNABLE TO PULL ANY MORE TRICKS OUT OF HIS HAT, AND HE WAS FACING A FACT HE COULD NO LONGER HIDE: HE IS THE ONE WHO IS SPREADING ARMED REVOLUTIONS IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND TRYING TO HAMPER DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES IN THE REGION. ONCE MORE HE HAS BEEN CAUGHT NOT HONORING THE COMMITMENTS AGREED ON IN TELA, BUT RATHER VIOLATING THESE COMMITMENTS. ON THIS OCCASION HE HAS BEEN LEFT WITH NO POSSIBLE DEFENSE. THEREFORE, IN OUR OPINION, HE HAS NO OPTION OTHER THAN TO ACCEPT THE REALITY OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CENTRAL AMERICA, OR SEE HIMSELF TOTALLY ISOLATED AMID A PEACE PLAN THAT HAS INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT. THIS SITUATION WOULD CAUSE HIM MANY PROBLEMS AND HEADACHES IN POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC MATTERS.
TST3-MUC4-0076	CLANDESTINE, 13 DEC 89 -- COMRADES: A NEW ELEMENT THAT WE MUST ANALYZE AND EXPLAIN EMERGED AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS' EMERGENCY MEETING. LET US SEE FIRST WHY THE MEETING TOOK PLACE. THE MAIN REASON IS THE VERY COMPLICATED PREDICAMENT IN WHICH OUR OFFENSIVE HAS PLACED CRISTIANI AND THE HIGH COMMAND. AS YOU WILL REMEMBER, THE GOVERNMENT HAS MET WITH MUCH INTERNATIONAL DISREPUTE AND ISOLATION BECAUSE OF THE BRUTAL ASSASSINATION OF JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE BOMBING OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. LET US RECALL, AS A SIGNIFICANT FACT, THAT THE UNITED NATIONS HAS CONDEMNED THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF ALL IT HAS DONE, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE LATEST ATROCITIES. ON THAT OCCASION, EL SALVADOR WAS THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT VOTED AGAINST THAT RESOLUTION WHILE 96 COUNTRIES VOTED IN FAVOR. WE MENTION THIS CASE AS A MOST SIGNIFICANT ONE, BUT THE FACT IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH WORLDWIDE CONDEMNATION THAT THE DICTATORSHIP HAS FOUND ITSELF IN A REALLY DESPERATE SITUATION. THIS WAS A CAUSE OF CONCERN FOR THE NORTH AMERICANS. TO WHOM COULD THEY TURN AT A TIME WHEN ALL INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS HAD TURNED THEIR BACKS ON CRISTIANI? THE NORTH AMERICANS HAD TO RESORT TO SOME FORUM THAT WOULD NOT CONDEMN THE GENOCIDAL REGIME AND THAT, ON THE CONTRARY, WOULD PROVIDE SUPPORT IN SPITE OF ALL THE ATROCITIES THE REGIME HAS COMMITTED. THE MOST SUITABLE IDEA WAS TO PROMOTE AN EMERGENCY MEETING OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, BECAUSE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, AS WE ALL KNOW, THE NORTH AMERICANS HAVE HAD THEIR BACKYARD AND MOST OF THESE COUNTRIES SERVE THEIR INTERESTS. THE MEETING WAS CALLED TO TRY TO PULL CRISTIANI OUT OF INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION. UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS DID SUMMIT TAKE PLACE? WE HAVE TO SAY FIRST THAT THE PRESIDENTS OF EL SALVADOR AND COSTA RICA, AND PROBABLY OF GUATEMALA, HAD REACHED AN AGREEMENT PRIOR TO THE MEETING. THE SUBJECT OF THE DISCUSSION WAS A DOCUMENT DRAFTED BY ARIAS AND CEREZO. THIS DOCUMENT EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR CRISTIANI FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. JOSEPH SULLIVAN, A U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL IN CHARGE OF LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS, AS WELL AS OTHER U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS, WERE PRESENT AT THE MEETING. THE COSTA RICAN AMBASSADOR TO NICARAGUA -- A PRO-U.S. MAN WHO INTRODUCED THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS AT THE MEETING -- WAS ALSO PRESENT, CONSPIRING ALL THE TIME. THE FMLN WAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO ENTER COSTA RICA. HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE MEETING HAD BEEN FIXED AND IN SPITE OF THE U.S. PRESENCE, THE AGREEMENT TO SUPPORT CRISTIANI WAS ACHIEVED ALMOST AT THE PRICE OF KILLING THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENT. IT WAS NOT EASY. THE U.S. WILL TO CONDEMN THE FMLN AND TO BACK CRISTIANI PREVAILED IN THE MIDST OF MUCH BICKERING AND THE INSOLENCE OF THE HONDURAN PRESIDENT. AS YOU CAN SEE, IT WAS NOT EASY TO FIND SUPPORT FOR THE GENOCIDAL REGIME EVEN IN PLACES WHERE THE NORTH AMERICANS THINK THEY HAVE THE BULL BY THE HORNS. LET US SEE, AS A THIRD POINT, IN WHAT THE DECLARATION CONSISTS.
TST3-MUC4-0077	BOGOTA, 15 DEC 89 -- IN VIEW OF THE SUCCESSFUL OPERATION TODAY IN WHICH GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, HIS SON FREDDY, AND SEVERAL OF HIS BODYGUARDS WERE KILLED, PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO TODAY CALLED AN URGENT COUNCIL OF MINISTERS MEETING TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION AND RECEIVE A FULL REPORT FROM MILITARY AND POLICE AUTHORITIES. HERE IS THE SECOND PART OF THE NEWS CONFERENCE FEATURING DAS DIRECTOR GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ. THE DAS HAS EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL MASTERMINDED TWO ATTACKS INCLUDING THE THE MOST RECENT AND WORST ONE IN WHICH MORE THAN 60 INNOCENT PEOPLE WERE KILLED. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA MASTERMINDED THE RECENT ATTACK ON DAS? BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE CONDUCTED ALONG WITH THE NATIONAL POLICE EVER SINCE THE ATTACK OCCURRED POINT IN THAT DIRECTION. IF WE COMPARE THE MODUS OPERANDI OF RODRIGUEZ AND HIS PEOPLE, WE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE AND THE ACTION ITSELF ARE VERY SIMILAR. FURTHERMORE, THIS MAN WAS IN THERE CELEBRATING THE GENOCIDE THAT HE HAD COMMITTED IN BOGOTA. BECAUSE THE INTELLIGENCE REPORTS INDICATE THIS, AND ACCORDING TO CERTAIN STATEMENTS WE HAVE, HE WAS OVERJOYED BY THE DAMAGE THAT HE HAD CAUSED IN THE CITY GIVEN THE LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED; SEEING HIM SUNBATHING AND SWIMMING ON THE ATLANTIC COAST LED US TO BELIEVE THIS. IS THIS A POLICE REACTION TO THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS' ATTACK ON DAS? NO, I AM NOT SAYING THAT IT IS A REACTION. THIS IS THE RESULT OF VERY PROFESSIONAL WORK ON THE PART OF THE NATIONAL POLICE. THAT IS WHAT I TOLD THE PRESIDENT TODAY. I BRIEFED HIM ON THE EVENTS WHICH LED TO THE ACTION THAT HAS CHANGED THE SITUATION WHICH HAD PREVAILED IN THE COUNTRY JUST A FEW HOURS AGO.
TST3-MUC4-0078	SANTIAGO, 19 DEC 89 -- FOREIGN MINISTER HERNAN FELIPE ERRAZURIZ HAS REPORTED THAT THE CHILEANS INVOLVED IN THE ABDUCTION OF BRAZILIAN BUSINESSMAN ABILIO DINIZ WILL BE PROSECUTED IN BRAZIL BECAUSE THE KIDNAPPING WAS PLANNED AND PERFORMED OUTSIDE OF CHILE. HE NOTED THAT, IN LINE WITH ITS POLICY IN SUCH MATTERS, THE CHILEAN FOREIGN MINISTRY HAS NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN THE RELEASE OF THE BUSINESSMAN. DINIZ WAS RELEASED AFTER BEING HELD FOR 6 DAYS BY FIVE CHILEANS, TWO CANADIANS, TWO ARGENTINES, AND ONE BRAZILIAN. THE POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT THE CHILEANS CLAIMED TO BELONG TO THE EXTREMIST MIR GROUP, BUT THIS ASSERTION HAS NOT YET BEEN CONFIRMED. ERRAZURIZ SAID THAT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY HAS BEEN IN PERMANENT CONTACT WITH CHILEAN AMBASSADOR TO BRAZIL RAUL SCHMIDT IN KEEPING TRACK OF THE CASE. THE MINISTER ALSO POINTED OUT THAT HE HAS BEEN IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH INTERNATIONAL SECURITY SERVICES, INCLUDING INTERPOL, TO DETERMINE THE IDENTITIES OF THE PRESUMED CHILEANS.
TST3-MUC4-0079	QUITO, 18 DEC 89 -- ACCORDING TO A COMMUNIQUE GIVEN TO AFP, THE INTERNATIONAL REBEL ORGANIZATION, THE AMERICA BATTALION, WILL "CONTINUE ITS CONTINENTAL STRUGGLE FOR LIBERTY, JUSTICE, AND LATIN AMERICAN DIGNITY." IN ADDITION TO THE COMMUNIQUE, PHOTOGRAPHS OF REBELS IN MOUNTAIN AREAS WERE ALSO GIVEN TO AFP. SIGNED BY THE AMERICAN BATTALION'S GENERAL COMMAND, THE COMMUNIQUE -- WRITTEN ON A SHEET WITHOUT THE ORGANIZATION'S LETTERHEAD -- STATES THAT THEY BACK THE DECISIONS MADE BY THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT OF COLOMBIA AND ALVARO LIVES, DAMMIT! OF ECUADOR TO SIGN PEACE AND DEMOCRACY AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE GOVERNMENTS. THESE TWO ORGANIZATIONS, TOGETHER WITH THE TUPAC AMARU MOVEMENT OF PERU, FOUNDED THE AMERICAN BATTALION IN COLOMBIA 5 YEARS AGO. THE BATTALION SUFFERED HEAVY CASUALTIES IN COLOMBIA AND IT WAS BELIEVED TO HAVE DISAPPEARED. TODAY'S COMMUNIQUE, HOWEVER, ANNOUNCED THE EXISTENCE OF OTHER ORGANIZATIONS FORMING THE AMERICAN BATTALION. THEY REQUEST THAT THE M-19 GIVE THEM THE SWORD OF LIBERATOR SIMON BOLIVAR AND RECALLED THEIR ORGANIZATION'S PRINCIPLES AND CAMILO TORRES' WORDS TO THE LIBERATOR: "GENERAL, AS LONG AS YOUR SWORD LIVES, THE FATHERLAND IS NOT DEAD." THE REBELS ALSO STATE THAT THEY BACK SINCERE LATIN AMERICAN EFFORTS TO ATTAIN PEACE FOR THE REGION AND "FIND POLITICAL SOLUTIONS WITH THE LOWEST SOCIAL COST AND LOSS OF BLOOD FOR OUR PEOPLE." THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION TOLD THE ANDEAN PRESIDENTS MEETING AT THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS THAT "TODAY THAT THEY HAVE THE POWER," THEY SHOULD "EXERT IT IN FAVOR OF THE PEOPLE, IN FAVOR OF A TRUE DEMOCRACY." HOWEVER, THEY CRITICIZED "THE MURDERS IN STREETS OF CARACAS," THE MURDERS IN THE JAILS OF PERU," AND "THE TORTURE IN THE JAILS OF ECUADOR." WITH REGARD TO THE ANDEAN LEADERS, THE REBELS NOTED THAT "EITHER THEY ARE WITH LATIN AMERICA OR THEY ARE WITH THE NORTHERN TYRANTS," REFERRING TO THE UNITED STATES. THE MOVEMENT STATES THAT THEY HAVE GATHERED ON REPRESSION AND STATES THAT 4,000 UNION MEMBERS HAVE BEEN ILLEGALLY ARRESTED AND THAT 200,000 HAVE "DISAPPEARED." "THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE NOT ALONE," ADDS THE COMMUNIQUE AND STATES THAT AT THE REQUEST OF THE PEOPLE OR THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, WE ARE "WILLING TO MOVE OUR MEN AND DECLARE WAR ON THE FACISTS' FOREIGN ECONOMIC INTERESTS," INCLUDING "PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATIVES" IN THE REGION. CONCLUDING, THE COMMUNIQUE STATES: "IF LATIN AMERICANS HAVE TO GO WITH BOLIVAR'S SWORD TO SAN SALVADOR AND CENTRAL AMERICA, WE WILL DO SO." THE DOCUMENT IS SIGNED BY THE COMMANDERS OF THE VICTORS' PACE REGIMENT , SAN MARTIN SOUTHERN FRONT , B-5-R NOBODY SURRENDERS HERE , AND E.R.P. BRIGADES.
TST3-MUC4-0080	SAN SALVADOR, 8 JAN 90 -- OFFICIAL SOURCES TODAY REPORTED THAT AT LEAST EIGHT PEOPLE, INCLUDING SOLDIERS, REBELS, AND CIVILIANS, WERE KILLED DURING CLASHES BETWEEN THE ARMY AND GUERRILLAS OVER THE PAST WEEKEND IN VARIOUS POINTS OF THE COUNTRY. MILITARY SPOKESMEN FOR THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE, HEADQUARTERED IN THE EASTERN USULUTAN DEPARTMENT, TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT TWO REBELS WERE KILLED AND ONE WOUNDED DURING A CLASH WITH GOVERNMENT TROOPS IN SAN AGUSTIN. MEANWHILE, THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE REPORTED THAT THE BODIES OF TWO GUERRILLAS, WHO WERE PRESUMABLY KILLED DURING CLASHES WITH THE ARMY, WERE FOUND BY SOLDIERS IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF SANTA TECLA, IN THE CENTRAL LA LIBERTAD DEPARTMENT.

THE BOMB WAS PLANTED IN A HEAVILY COMMERCIAL AREA OF DOWNTOWN SALVADOR CAUSING HEAVY PROPERTY LOSES, ACCORDING TO THE OWNERS WHO PROVIDED NO SPECIFIC FIGURES. THIS IS THE FOURTH DYNAMITE ATTACK ON BUSINESSES IN SALVADOR SO FAR IN 1990. THE GUERRILLAS INTENSIFIED THEIR ACTS OF SABOTAGE AGAINST THE ECONOMY, ESPECIALLY AGAINST THE ENTIRE ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEM, ON 2 JANUARY WHEN AN UNILATERAL MILITARY TRUCE THEY DECREED OVER THE CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR HOLIDAYS HAD EXPIRED.
TST3-MUC4-0081	LIMA, NO DATE -- GOOD EVENING. I HAVE CALLED THIS NEWS CONFERENCE TO READ A FOREIGN MINISTRY COMMUNIQUE: TODAY THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT TOLD LUIS SANDIGA CABRERA, OUR CHARGE D'AFFAIRES IN PANAMA, THAT HE MUST LEAVE PANAMA IN 72 HOURS. 2. WE HAVE EXPRESSED TO THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THE PANAMANIAN CHARGE D'AFFAIRES IN LIMA, OUR SURPRISE AND STRONG PROTEST OVER THAT DECISION. 3. IN VIEW OF THIS DECISION, THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO REDUCE THE PERSONNEL OF ITS DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN PANAMA AND TO MAINTAIN ITS RELATIONS WITH THAT COUNTRY AT THE FIRST SECRETARY LEVEL. PERU WILL IN THIS WAY CONTINUE TO FULFILL THE HUMANITARIAN MISSION OF PROTECTING THOSE WHO HAVE SOUGHT ASYLUM IN ITS EMBASSY IN PANAMA WHILE THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT ISSUES THE SAFE-CONDUCTS THAT WE REQUESTED IN ACCORDANCE TO THE CONVENTION ON DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM SIGNED IN CARACAS ON 28 MARCH 1954. PERU IS CONTACTING THE MEMBERS OF THE PERMANENT MECHANISM FOR CONSULTATION AND POLITICAL AGREEMENT TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION AND TO ASK FOR SOLIDARITY AND COOPERATION IN OVERCOMING THIS MOMENTARY CRISIS. THE DELICATE SITUATION REGARDING THE PEOPLE AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY HAS PROVOKED OUR JUSTIFIED ALARM AND IMPELLED US TO BEGIN TALKS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM WILL BE RESPECTED. WE HAVE TALKED WITH THE AMBASSADORS FROM THE COUNTRIES OF THE PERMANENT MECHANISM FOR CONSULTATION AND POLITICAL AGREEMENT. I HAVE PERSONALLY SPOKEN WITH THE AMBASSADORS OF VENEZUELA, MEXICO, AND COLOMBIA. I AM NOW READY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS: MR LARCO COX, UNOFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE SAID THAT THE PEOPLE IN THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA ARE NOT EXACTLY POLITICAL REFUGEES BUT COMMON CRIMINALS. WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THIS? THE COUNTRY THAT GRANTS ASYLUM DETERMINES THIS. WE HAVE BEEN VERY CAREFUL TO REVIEW EACH ONE OF THEM AND THEIR FILES. WE HAVE CHECKED TO SEE IF ANY OF THEM WERE FACING ANY TRIALS IN PANAMA OR THE UNITED STATES. OUR INVESTIGATION HAS REVEALED THAT NONE OF THEM ARE FACING ANY TRIALS. THE CHARGES WERE MADE AFTERWARD. WE SEE THIS AS A RESULT OF THE EMOTIONAL CLIMATE PRESENTLY EXISTING IN PANAMA. WHAT IS YOUR PERSONAL OPINION OF THE INCIDENT? IT IS THE DIPLOMATIC WAY TO EXPRESS A PROTEST OVER WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE. ACCORDING TO PANAMANIAN REPORTS, CHARGE D'AFFAIRES LUIS SANDIGA HAS MADE STATEMENTS ON THE SITUATION THAT DID NOT PLEASE THE GOVERNMENT. THE TRUTH IS THAT SANDIGA HAS NOT MADE ANY DECLARATIONS. HOWEVER, FORMER AMBASSADOR CASTRO ARENAS IS IN PANAMA AND HE HAS EMBARKED ON A CAMPAIGN IN WHICH HE IS SEEKING RETALIATION AGAINST THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT. HE COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING BETTER THAN TO POINT AT SANDIGA AS THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR ALLEGED STATEMENTS. SANDIGA HAS NOT SAID A WORD ABOUT THE SITUATION BECAUSE THAT IS NOT HIS JOB. BESIDES, HIS CAR AND THE CAR BELONGING TO ONE OF THE EMBASSY'S MILITARY ATTACHES HAVE BEEN STOLEN; THERE IS NO WAY TO BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION. ARE YOU SAYING THAT FORMER AMBASSADOR CASTRO ARENAS IS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SITUATION? YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS. IF THE SITUATION DETERIORATES, WILL PERU RECALL ALL OF ITS PERSONNEL FROM PANAMA? WE CANNOT GO TO THAT EXTREME BECAUSE WE ARE FULFILLING A HUMANITARIAN CAUSE, AS WE SAID IN THE COMMUNIQUE. OUR FIRST RESPONSIBILITY AT THIS TIME IS TO SEE THAT THE RIGHT OF ASYLUM IS RESPECTED. AS LONG AS THE REFUGEES REMAIN IN THE EMBASSY, WE WILL MAINTAIN OUR REPRESENTATION AT THE LEVEL OF FIRST SECRETARY.
TST3-MUC4-0082	BOGOTA, 24 JAN 90 -- THE COLOMBIAN LEFTIST ALLIANCE, PATRIOTIC UNION , WAS THE FIRST PARTY TO REGISTER A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN THE UPCOMING 27 MAY ELECTIONS WHEN IT OFFICIALLY REGISTERED BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA, 34, AS ITS CANDIDATE TODAY. PRIOR TO JARAMILLO OSSA'S ARRIVAL AT THE NATIONAL REGISTRY OFFICE, ACCOMPANIED BY 12 BODYGUARDS, EXPLOSIVES EXPERTS FROM THE SECRET POLICE DEPARTMENT CHECKED THE BUILDING AND CORDONED OFF THE ENTRANCE HE WAS GOING TO USE. UP WAS FOUNDED IN 1985 AND HAS LOST ALMOST 1,000 MEMBERS AND REGIONAL LEADERS IN VIOLENT ATTACKS. IT HAS ALSO LOST MOST OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES IN BOGOTA, INCLUDING JAIME PARDO LEAL, THE PARTY FOUNDER AND A PREVIOUS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WHO WAS MURDERED IN 1987. COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY PRESIDENT GILBERTO VIEIRA AND THE ENTIRE UP DIRECTORATE ATTENDED BERNARDO JARAMILLO'S REGISTRATION. LAST WEEK, THE STATE COUNCIL, COLOMBIA'S HIGHEST LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE BODY, HAD ACCREDITED BERNARDO JARAMILLO AS UP'S PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. BEFORE MAKING HIS CANDIDACY EFFECTIVE, BERNARDO JARAMILLO TOLD EFE THAT HE WOULD ATTEMPT TO BECOME "THE WILL OF A WIDE AND DEMOCRATIC SECTOR OF THE PEOPLE AND AN ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL COLOMBIAN BIPARTISANSHIP." HE ADDED: "OUR MOVEMENT WANTS TO TRANSCEND THE LIMITS OF THE UP AND OBTAIN FOLLOWERS FROM OTHER SECTORS OF THE DEMOCRATIC LEFT WHO SUPPORT NEW GOVERNMENT ALTERNATIVES." HE DID NOT REJECT THE POSSIBILITY THAT UP AND THE 19TH APRIL MOVEMENT , A REBEL MOVEMENT THAT IS MAKING EFFORTS TO JOIN THE COUNTRY'S LEGAL POLITICAL SYSTEM, WILL PRESENT JOINT ELECTORAL TICKETS IN SOME REGIONS IN THE COUNTRY. "THERE IS NOTHING CONCRETE ON THIS," HE ADDED, "BUT IT COULD BE AN ALTERNATIVE IF THEY PROPOSE IT." UP PRESIDENT DIEGO MONTANA STATED THAT "OUR PARTY'S MAIN OBJECTIVE IN THESE ELECTIONS IS TO BREAK THE LIBERAL AND SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE HEGEMONY." THESE TWO SECTORS HAVE SHARED POWER DURING COLOMBIA'S ENTIRE REPUBLICAN PERIOD. "WE PRESENT OUR CANDIDATE TO OTHER POLITICAL MOVEMENTS WITH THE HOPE THAT HIS CANDIDACY WILL BE BACKED AND THAT WE CAN CREATE A NEW AND WIDER FORCE WITH POSSIBILITIES OF ATTAINING VICTORY," HE NOTED. JARAMILLO'S CAMPAIGN SLOGAN, "COUNTRYMEN, GIVE ME YOUR HAND" APPEARED IN POSTERS THROUGHOUT BOGOTA TODAY. AFTER REGISTERING, BERNARDO JARAMILLO ATTENDED THE FUNERAL OF A FELLOW PARTY MEMBER, VLADIMIR ESCOBAR, A SOACHA MUNICIPAL OFFICIAL WHO WAS SHOT BETWEEN THE EYES AND KILLED THIS WEEK. THE SOACHA MUNICIPALITY IS CLOSE TO BOGOTA.
TST3-MUC4-0083	CLANDESTINE, 31 JAN 90 -- CONCERNING THE PROSPECTS FOR THE DIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION BASED ON THE MEDIATION OF UN SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR AND THE DEBATE IN THE U.S. CONGRESS ON THE AID TO EL SALVADOR, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT REPORTS: 1. WE HAVE VIEWED WITH GREAT CONCERN THE GOVERNMENT AND ARMY'S REJECTION MR PEREZ DE CUELLAR'S PARTICIPATION IN THE DIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION PROCESS AS A MEDIATOR. THIS ATTITUDE IS AN OBSTACLE TO A PROCESS THAT COULD FACILITATE THE NEGOTIATION EFFORT. ON OUR PART, WE HAVE ACCEPTED THIS MEDIATION AND WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE IT. 2. THE STATE OF SIEGE, THE ASSASSINATION OF SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER HECTOR OQUELI, THE DOUBTFUL AND INSUFFICIENT INITIAL RESULTS IN THE CASE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE ABSENCE OF CONDITIONS FOR THE POLITICAL ACTIVITY OF THE OPPOSITION, THE CONTINUATION OF THE PERSECUTION OF CHURCHES, AND THE LACK OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH THROUGH THE DIRECT OR COVERT GAGGING OF THE PRESS SHOW THAT CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT IS CARRYING OUT A POLICY OF CONFRONTATION WITH ALL THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL FORCES. FOR THIS REASON, THE TERMS OF THE DIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION MUST BE REORIENTED SO THAT IT WILL BE TURNED INTO A NATIONAL PROCESS WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL THOSE FORCES. 3. WE VIEW AS GRAVELY ERRONEOUS THE PERSISTENCE OF A GOVERNMENT POLICY BASED ON THE IDEA OF THE FMLN'S ALLEGED MILITARY WEAKNESS. THIS POSITION, SIMILAR TO THE ONE THAT WAS PUT FORTH PRIOR TO 11 NOVEMBER WILL ONLY LEAD THE COUNTRY TO GREATER LEVELS OF CONFRONTATION. 4. WE REAFFIRM OUR WILLINGNESS TO HOLD THE MEETING OF BOTH SIDES WITH THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL SOON. WE HOPE THAT MR CRISTIANI'S VISIT TO THE UNITED NATIONS WILL LEAD TO SUCH A MEETING AND THAT WE CAN AGREE WITH THE MEDIATOR ON THE DATE TO HOLD IT. 5. WE BELIEVE THAT THE U.S. AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS DIRECTED AGAINST DEMOCRATIZATION AND A POLITICAL SOLUTION. THE SENDING OF SIGNALS TO ONE OR ANOTHER SECTOR OF THE GOVERNMENT OR ARMY, USING THE PRESSURE OF SETTING CONDITIONS OR THREATENING THE END OF AID, DOES NOT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. WE BELIEVE THE MEMBERS OF THE U.S. CONGRESS CAN MAKE AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO END THE WAR IN OUR COUNTRY BY AGREEING TO SUSPEND THAT AID, SOMETHING WHICH COULD FORM PART OF A NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT THAT WOULD SIMULTANEOUSLY ENTAIL A CEASE-FIRE. FMLN GENERAL COMMAND COMMANDERS SALVADOR SANCHEZ CEREN, SHAFIK JORGE HANDAL, FRANCISCO JOVEL, EDUARDO SANCHO, JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS 30 JANUARY 1990
TST3-MUC4-0084	SAN SALVADOR, 2 FEB 90 -- IT WAS OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT SIX SALVADORAN SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AS A RESULT OF CLASHES WITH SALVADORAN REBELS IN NORTHERN EL SALVADOR OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS. MEANWHILE, IT WAS ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THE REBELS ATTACKED MILITARY POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR, BLEW UP A STORE, AND BURNED A PUBLIC BUS. THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE REPORTED THAT THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT AND MEMBERS OF THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE MET IN HEAVY CLASHES IN THE HAMLET OF EL ZUNGANO, IN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT, IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY, ON THE AFTERNOON OF 1 FEBRUARY. SIX SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AS A RESULT OF THE CLASHES. COPREFA ADDED THAT SEVERAL GUERRILLAS WERE KILLED OR WOUNDED. IN ADDITION, IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE FMLN, AN ARMED GROUP THAT HAS BEEN FIGHTING AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT FOR ALMOST 10 YEARS, HARASSED TWO NATIONAL GUARD POSTS LAST NIGHT. THE POLICE REPORTED THAT A POWERFUL BOMB WENT OFF AT AN ELECTRICAL APPLIANCE STORE IN DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR THIS MORNING, BUT CAUSING ONLY PROPERTY DAMAGE.
TST3-MUC4-0085	HAVANA , 10 FEB 90 -- SMARTLY DRESSED AND SPEAKING IN NEARLY PERFECT ENGLISH, SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS AGAIN VISITED THE UNITED STATES, WHERE HE TRIED TO APPEAR AT THE CONGRESS AND THE UNITED NATIONS AS A STATESMAN AWARE OF HIS RIGHTS. THIS IS, HOWEVER, A CRITICAL MOMENT FOR THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT, AND HE KNOWS IT. BUT THIS POINT WAS ALSO STRESSED BY THE LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO BOOED HIM AT NEARLY EVERY LARGE U.S. CITY HE VISITED. ALTHOUGH THE GHOSTS OF THE ASSASSINATED JESUITS SHADOWED HIM ALL DURING HIS TOUR, THE ARENA REPRESENTATIVE, JUST AS HIS PREDECESSOR JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE DID, FLEW TO THE UNITED STATES TO TRY TO CONVINCE THE LEGISLATORS, PARTICULARLY THE DEMOCRATS, THAT HE INTENDS TO RESUME THE DIALOGUE FOR PEACE AND CHECK THE ARMY'S CRIMINAL ASPIRATIONS. WAVING THE HUMAN RIGHTS FLAG HAS BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR CRISTIANI, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE HE IS AWARE THAT WITH THIS ACTION HE CAN CONTINUE TO RECEIVE WASHINGTON'S FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR HIS GOVERNMENT. ACCORDING TO TO SOME EXPERTS, CRISTIANI WENT FARTHER THAN HIS PREDECESSOR. HE ASKED THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL TO HELP IN THE RESUMPTION OF TALKS WITH THE GUERRILLAS, REPLACED SEVERAL MILITARY OFFICERS OF DOUBTFUL REPUTATION, AND ASSURED HE WILL PUNISH SEVERELY EIGHT SOLDIERS ACCUSED OF ASSASSINATING THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS. WE MUST KEEP IN MIND THAT, PRIOR TO HIS TRIP, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT SUCCEEDED IN CURBING A COUP ATTEMPT STAGED BY ARMY REACTIONARY GROUPS. MEMBERS OF THE SALVADORAN OPPOSITION HAVE COINCIDED IN THER VIEW THAT NEVER BEFORE HAD A HEAD OF STATE CHALLENGED THE MILITARY HIERARCHY TO SUCH AN EXTENT, A HIERARCHY THAT OPPOSES ALL NEGOTIATION WITH THE GUERRILLAS. THE EXPERTS ALSO SAID, HOWEVER, THAT THE COUNTRY'S INTERNAL SITUATION HAS NEVER BEEN SO SERIOUS. THE REBEL OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED IN NOVEMBER IS A LANDMARK, AFTER WHICH EVERYTHING WILL BE DIFFERENT IN EL SALVADOR, BEGINNING WITH THE GOVERNMENT PARTY, WHICH WAS LEFT IN A VERY DELICATE SITUATION IN THE EYES OF INFLUENTIAL U.S. POWER CIRCLES. THE GUERRILLA DRIVE ALSO DEMONSTRATED THAT ONLY TWO ALTERNATIVES ARE LEFT FOR THE COUNTRY. IF SERIOUS PEACE NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOT INITIATED, THE COUNTERINSURGENCY POLICY WILL BE AGGRAVATED. THIS COULD EVEN GIVE THE UNITED STATES A PRETEXT TO INTERVENE DIRECTLY IN THE COUNTRY. ALTHOUGH PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH SAID HE WOULD CONTINUE TO AID EL SALVADOR, A LARGE NUMBER OF LEGISLATORS FOR A LONG TIME HAVE BEEN QUESTIONING WHAT USE HAS BEEN NEARLY $4 BILLION DELIVERED TO THE SALVADORAN ARMY IN 10 YEARS OF WAR. IF FOR THE WHITE HOUSE THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO CONTINUE TO GIVE MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR OR RESIGN ITSELF TO AN EVENTUAL VICTORY OF THE REBELS, FOR CRISTIANI THE SITUATION IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE, TO GET MORE MONEY, HE MUST ENSURE THAT HUMAN RIGHTS ARE RESPECTED. THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO INFLUENCING THE MOST REACTIONARY MILITARY OFFICERS AND GUARANTEEING THE FULFILLMENT OF THE FAMOUS ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN ADVOCATED BY HIS PARTY. THESE POINTS ARE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLY WITH IN A COUNTRY IMMERSED IN WAR. IF THE ECONOMY IS WEAK, RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IS EVEN WEAKER. ANYWAY, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS PLANNING TO INCREASE AID FOR THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT. THIS CONTRIBUTES TO PUTTING FAR INTO THE DISTANCE ANY PLANS TO END THE WAR.
TST3-MUC4-0086	NO CITY, NO DATE -- "WHILE FARC COMPLIED AND CONTINUES TO COMPLY WITH THE UNILATERAL CEASE-FIRE, THE ARMY HAS BEEN CONDUCTING MILITARY OFFENSIVES AGAINST SEVERAL FARC FRONTS, SUCH AS 1, 5, 10, 26, 38, 24, 18, 11, 23, 19, 41, 46, AND OTHERS. "FARC, HOWEVER, PERSISTS IN ITS EFFORT TO COMPLY WITH ITS PLEDGED WORD, NATURALLY WITHOUT RELINQUISHING ITS LEGITIMATE DEFENSE WHEN IT COMES TO MILITARY OPERATIONS," THE LETTER TO THE NOTABLES ADDED. "OUR SAYING THAT THROUGH YOU WE ARE PROPOSING TO THE GOVERNMENT A CEASE-FIRE SO THE MARCH LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS AND THE MAY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS CAN BE HELD IN A CLIMATE OF PEACE AND DEMOCRATIC GUARANTEES DOES NOT CHANGE OUR PREVIOUS STAND REGARDING OUR UNILATERAL CEASE-FIRE. "WE ARE NOW PROPOSING THAT THIS CEASE-FIRE BE GENERAL DURING THE ELECTIONS AND THAT THE EMINENT ADDRESSEES OF THE LETTER BECOME SUPERVISORS OF WHAT COULD BE A NEW PROCESS OF RECONCILIATION AND PEACE IN THE COLOMBIAN FAMILY," THE LETTER STATED. THE REBEL LEADERS SAID THAT, BECAUSE NEW DISAGREEMENTS AND CONFLICTS HAVE APPEARED IN THE MIDST OF A CRISIS NEVER BEFORE HEARD OF IN THE COUNTRY, "WE ARE INSISTING ON THIS GENERAL CEASE-FIRE PROPOSAL." THE LETTER SAID FURTHER: "BECAUSE, FAR FROM DIMINISHING, CRIMES AGAINST PUBLIC ORDER, SUCH AS ABDUCTIONS, EXTORTION, AND THREATS, NOT ONLY HAVE INCREASED IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS BUT PREVAIL IN VARIOUS AREAS OF COLOMBIA, WE COULD HARDLY ASK THE ARMED FORCES TO STOP THEIR FUNCTIONS OF PROTECTING THE LIVES AND PROPERTIES OF THE PEOPLE. "WE THINK IT IS NECESSARY TO CLARIFY THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE POLICE CASES AND THOSE OF PUBLIC ORDER THAT ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ARMED FORCES, ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION. SIMILARLY, WE MUST CLARIFY THAT KIDNAPPINGS, EXTORTION, AND THREATS ARE NOT PART OF THE POLICY OF THE FARC STAFF. "WE ARE HEREBY PROPOSING TO THE EMINENT SUPERVISORS TO JOIN US IN THE SEARCH FOR WAYS LEADING TO PEACE AND INDEPENDENT PROGRESS IN THE COUNTRY. "FARC STAFF, IN THE MOUNTAINS OF COLOMBIA.

TST3-MUC4-0087	TEGUCIGALPA, 22 FEB 90 -- CONTRA COMMANDER ISRAEL GALEANO, ALIAS FRANKLIN, HAS TOLD TIEMPO THAT THE ANTI-SANDINIST REBELS WILL STAY ARMED, REGARDLESS OF THE RESULTS OF THE 25 FEBRUARY ELECTIONS IN NICARAGUA, TO MAKE SURE THE DEMOCRATIC CHANGES TAKE PLACE. "WE WILL MAINTAIN OUR ORGANIZATION INTACT EVEN IF THE UNO WINS, WAITING FOR PROFOUND DEMOCRATIC CHANGES AND AN END TO THE REPRESSIVE REGIME IMPOSED BY THE SANDINISTS," SAID THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE . THIS PAST JANUARY, THE 29-YEAR-OLD GALEANO BECAME THE LEADER OF ABOUT 12,000 NICARAGUAN RIGHTIST REBELS BASED IN HONDURAS WHEN THE POST OF COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE RN ARMY, A POST ENRIQUE BERMUDEZ HAD HELD FOR 10 YEARS, WAS ELIMINATED. NICARAGUA WILL HOLD ELECTIONS ON SUNDAY, 25 FEBRUARY, AND THE MAIN CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ARE DANIEL ORTEGA OF THE SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT AND VIOLETA DE CHAMORRO OF THE UNO. THE REBELS, SUPPORTED BY THE UNITED STATES, HAVE URGED NICARAGUANS TO VOTE FOR THE UNO CANDIDATE. "IF THE UNO WINS, WE WILL MAINTAIN OUR ORGANIZATION INTACT TO SEE IF ON 25 APRIL THERE IS A TOTAL TRANSFER OF POWER AND PROFOUND REFORMS, AND PARTICULARLY TO SEE IF THE REPRESSIVE SYSTEM DISAPPEARS," GALEANO SAID. "IF THE SANDINISTS WIN OR STEAL THE ELECTIONS, THERE WILL BE A SOCIAL DISRUPTION AGAINST THE SYSTEM AND THE HARDEST STRUGGLE OF RECENT YEARS WILL TAKE PLACE," HE ADDED. THE CONTRA MILITARY CHIEF SAID THAT "IF THE PEOPLE DO NOT ACCEPT A SANDINIST VICTORY, "WE WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE FIGHTING." HE ASSURED THAT THE NICARAGUANS WILL NOT ACCEPT AN FSLN VICTORY IN THE 25 FEBRUARY ELECTIONS. GALEANO ADDED THAT THE SANDINISTS HAVE DEPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 30,000 TROOPS IN THE NORTHERN NICARAGUAN DEPARTMENTS IN ORDER TO "INTIMIDATE AND MURDER" UNO FOLLOWERS AND TO PREVENT APPROXIMATELY 300,000 NICARAGUANS FROM VOTING. GALEANO POINTED OUT THAT THE PRESS AND THE FOREIGN OBSERVERS OF THE ELECTIONS HAVE NO ACCESS TO THE AREAS WHERE THE NICARAGUAN TROOPS HAVE DEPLOYED. "EVEN THOUGH THE FOREIGN OBSERVERS CLAIM THAT THE CAMPAIGN WAS FREELY HELD, THE PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO MAKE SACRIFICES," HE SAID. GALEANO SAID THAT ABOUT 5,000 OF HIS MEN ARE INSIDE NICARAGUA, AND BETWEEN 10,000 TO 12,000 MEN ARE IN BASES IN HONDURAS, "NOT MOVING, BUT JUST OBSERVING THE ELECTORAL PROCESS" IN NICARAGUA. THE REBELS IN HONDURAS ARE RECEIVING U.S. HUMANITARIAN AID IN EL PARAISO DEPARTMENT AND HAVE REJECTED A DEMOBILIZATION PLAN APPROVED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS. THE REBELS CLAIM THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY GUARANTEES FOR THEIR PERSONAL SECURITY AND FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. "THE DEMOBILIZATION IS BASED ON THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT CREATING CONDITIONS THAT WILL ENCOURAGE THE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED RN TO JOIN CIVIC LIFE," HE ADDED. GALEANO SAID THAT THE DISMANTLING OF HIS FORCES DOES NOT "DEPEND OF A SIMPLE ELECTIONS," BUT RATHER ON "THE SANDINISTS LEAVING POWER COMPLETELY." THE CONTRA LEADER WARNED THAT "WE CANNOT LAY DOWN OUR WEAPONS WHEN THE CAUSES THAT LED TO OUR TAKING UP ARMS HAVE NOT DISAPPEARED. THERE STILL IS REPRESSION, A LACK OF FREEDOM, AND ALL OF THIS WAS GENERATED BY THE SANDINISTS." HE POINTED OUT THAT IN THE EVENT THE UNO SHOULD WIN THE 25 FEBRUARY ELECTIONS, "WE WOULD HAVE TO CARRY OUT A MUTUAL DEMOBILIZATION. THE NICARAGUAN PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED WITH AN INTER-AMERICAN PEACE FORCE THAT WILL RECEIVE ALL THE WEAPONRY AND SOVIET TANKS OF THE SANDINISTS. THEN, WHEN WE ARE AT AN EVEN LEVEL OF FORCES, WE WILL TURN OVER OUR OWN WEAPONS." THE CONTRA CHIEF SUGGESTED A NATIONAL POLICE BE CREATED IN NICARAGUA. FRANKLIN SAID THAT THE CONTRAS ARE WILLING TO CONTINUE THE PEACE TALKS, BUT PERHAPS AFTER THE ELECTIONS, WITH THE NEW NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT. HE ASSURED THAT THE REBEL FORCES WILL NOT CARRY OUT "ANY OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS BEFORE, DURING, OR AFTER THE ELECTIONS, AND WILL WAIT AND SEE IF THERE ARE CHANGES IN NICARAGUA." HE SAID THAT THE CONTRAS ARE WILLING TO LEAVE THEIR CAMPS IN YAMALES IF REQUESTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF RAFAEL LEONARDO CALLEJAS. "IF POLITICAL CONDITIONS DO NOT ALLOW US TO REMAIN, WE WILL LEAVE , BUT OUR REFUGEEES WILL STAY, AS REFUGEES," HE ADDED. THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE CONTRAS SAID THAT HIS FORCES WILL NOT ATTACK THE UN PEACE OBSERVERS IN THE HONDURAN-NICARAGUAN BORDER AREA. HE SAID THAT RN RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES ARE NORMAL, BUT DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE OUSTING OF BERMUDEZ, ARGUING THAT THIS IS A FAIT ACCOMPLI.
TST3-MUC4-0088	BOGOTA, 24 FEB 90 -- CALM APPEARS TO BE RETURNING TO THE COUNTRY FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF ONE NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER AND SIX SOLDIERS ON 23 FEBRUARY AS A RESULT OF GUERRILLA ATTACKS IN FIVE ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT MUNICIPALITIES, THE KIDNAPPING OF A MAYOR, A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, AND A CANDIDATE IN CAUCA DEPARTMENT, AND THE DEATH OF A GUERRILLA IN GUAVIARE. THE GUERRILLA ACTIONS BEGAN ON THE EVENING OF 22 FEBRUARY WHEN A LARGE COLUMN OF THE POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY ENTERED TURBO MUNICIPALITY, NORTHEAST OF ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, AND SABOTAGED THE POWER SYSTEM LEAVING THE ENTIRE AREA WITHOUT ELECTRICITY. NATIONAL ARMY SPOKESMEN SAID THAT ONE NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER AND SIX SOLDIERS WERE KILLED, FOUR WERE WOUNDED, AND 15 OTHERS WERE KIDNAPPED DURING THE ATTACKS AGAINST MILITARY BASES AND POLICE INSTALLATIONS IN SEGOVIA BY THE 4TH FRONT OF THE FARC . MEANWHILE IN BOGOTA, MILITARY FORCES COMMANDER NELSON MEJIA HENAO DENIED THAT COLOMBIA IS IN GUERRILLA HANDS AND REAFFIRMED THE TROOPS' UNYIELDING DETERMINATION TO DEFEND NATIONAL ORDER AND DEMOCRACY. THE HIGHEST-RANKING OFFICER, WHO EXPRESSED REGRET OVER THE DEATHS OF THE SOLDIERS IN SEGOVIA, ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, SAID THAT THIS TYPE OF INCIDENT IS NORMAL WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE WAR THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS WAGING AGAINST ARMED SUBVERSION. LAST NIGHT, PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS, AFTER THE CLOSING CEREMONY OF THE 25TH AGRARIAN CONGRESS OF THE , SAID THAT THE GUERRILLAS ARE DESPERATE AND THIS IS REFLECTED IN THEIR ACTIONS. NEVERTHELESS, THE ARMED FORCES WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT SUBVERSION ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY, HE ADDED. THE PRESIDENT EXPRESSED HIS SATISFACTION AT THE RELEASE OF SANTANDER DEPARTMENT SENATOR JORGE SERRANO GONZALEZ, WHOM HE DESCRIBED AS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE THAT COLOMBIAN DEMOCRACY HAS AT THIS MOMENT. HE ADDED FINALLY: I HOPE THAT IS HE ALREADY AT HOME WITH HIS FAMILY.
TST3-MUC4-0089	SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE -- THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT MAINTAINS ITS STANCE REGARDING THE DIALOGUE PROCESS AND ITS RESUMPTION. WE BELIEVE IT CONSTITUTES THE MOST EXPEDIENT WAY TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN THE COUNTRY, AND WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE ALONG THAT PATH. AIDA MONTALVO. IN REGARD TO THE RENEGOTIATION OF THE FOREIGN DEBT, WHEN ARE YOU PLANNING TO GO TO MEXICO, AND HOW WILL THE SALVADORAN DEBT WITH THAT COUNTRY BE RENEGOTIATED? THE TIMETABLE FOR THE TRIP IS STILL UNDECIDED. THERE IS NOT DEFINITE DATE. I THINK IT MAY TAKE PLACE IN APRIL OR MAY OF THIS YEAR. OUR FIRST SCHEDULED VISIT WILL BE TO VENEZUELA. CARLOS MARIO MARQUEZ OF AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE. SOCIAL ASPECTS. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE STATUS IS OF THAT, SINCE SOME SUPPORT HAVING PRIMARY MEETINGS AND THEN A SUMMIT, SO TO SPEAK? I DO NOT THINK THAT IS THE CAUSE OF THAT PROBLEM. WE SAID THAT THE RESUMPTION OF THE TALKS MUST TAKE PLACE WHEN THE FMLN ENTERS THE DIALOGUE PROCESS WITH A SERIOUS ATTITUDE. WE MAINTAIN OUR STANCE THAT THEY MUST STOP ALL VIOLENCE THAT IS DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY AFFECTING CIVILIANS, THAT IS, ALL THE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES THE FMLN CONDUCTS. THIS IS A SMALL REQUEST THAT OBTAINED THE SUPPORT OF ALL THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AT THE SAN ISIDRO CORONADO MEETING IN COSTA RICA. I THINK THAT THIS IS THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. THEY HAVE ASKED FOR CHANGES IN FORMAT, AND WE SAID WE HAD NO PROBLEM WITH MOST OF THE REQUESTS WE HAVE RECEIVED. WE ARE NOW WAITING FOR THE FMLN, SINCE THEY ASKED FOR TIME TO ANALYZE THINGS A LITTLE BEFORE HAVING THE MEETING. WE ARE AWAITING THE VISIT OF MR. DE SOTO IN EARLY MARCH. OBVIOUSLY, THE DIALOGUE HAS NOT TAKEN PLACE BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES, . I THINK THE CHIEF DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE FMLN DOES NOT WANT TO AGREE TO STOP TERRORIST ACTIONS, AND THAT IS WHY THERE IS NO DIALOGUE NOW. EPIGMENIO IBARRA. MR. PRESIDENT, YESTERDAY IN NICARAGUA, DANIEL ORTEGA SAID AT A RALLY THAT HE WILL WAGE A CONSTRUCTIVE OPPOSITION. HE SAID THAT THE REVOLUTION DID NOT DIE WITH THE ELECTIONS. HE SAID THAT THE SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT WILL RULE FROM BELOW. WE SENSE A PRETTY COMPLEX CLIMATE FOR THE TRANSITION IN NICARAGUA. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT DANIEL ORTEGA'S STATEMENTS? HOW DO YOU VIEW THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE MAY BE A TRUE TRANSITION FROM POWER TO POWER INSTEAD OF A TRANSITION OF GOVERNMENT IN NICARAGUA? AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE, STATEMENTS BY ORTEGA AND OTHER REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SANDINIST FRONT ARE A SOURCE OF CONCERN. THEY COULD INDICATE THAT THE ELECTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN VERY FREE AND HONEST, BUT ALSO A FARCE AS FAR AS IMPROVING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IS CONCERNED. THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE WOULD BE DENIED THE RIGHT TO FREELY PICK THEIR RULERS AND THE RIGHT OF THESE RULERS TO ACT AS THEY DEEM BEST. I WOULD SAY THAT THE NICARAGUAN REVOLUTION BELONGS NOT JUST TO THE FSLN. THE FSLN WAS ONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE REVOLUTION IN NICARAGUA AGAINST ANASTASIO SOMOZA. THE FACT IS THAT A CONSENSUS EXISTED AMONG ALL SECTORS THAT SUPPORTED THAT REVOLUTION. THE FSLN HAS NO MONOPOLY ON OR EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OVER THAT REVOLUTION. I BELIEVE THAT IN IDEOLOGICAL TERMS THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE VIEWS OF MS. CHAMORRO AND UNO , THAT IS, THE NEW GOVERNMENT-ELECT, AND THE VIEWS OF THE FSLN. YET, THE PEOPLE PICKED THE GOVERNMENT. IT IS WORRISOME TO HEAR SOME STATEMENTS THAT THE FSLN WILL RULE FROM BELOW. WE BELIEVE THEY WOULD SEEK TO DO THAT BY KEEPING CONTROL OVER THE ARMY. LET ME REPEAT: THERE IS NOTHING DEMOCRATIC ABOUT A POLITICAL PARTY CONTROLLING THE ARMY. THE ARMY MUST RESPOND TO THE GOVERNMENT AND THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, AND NOT TO JUST ONE POLITICAL PARTY. WE BELIEVE THINGS HAVE NOT BEEN SETTLED YET. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE STILL MANY THINGS LEFT PENDING.
TST3-MUC4-0090	GUATEMALA CITY, 6 MAR 90 -- THE EMBASSY COMMUNIQUE POINTS OUT THAT THE UNITED STATES DID NOT SUBMIT EITHER ONE OF THE TWO HUMAN RIGHTS RESOLUTIONS ON GUATEMALA THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER DISCUSSION IN GENEVA. ACCORDING TO THE OBSERVERS, THIS CLARIFICATION CAME IN REPLY TO STATEMENTS MADE BY CEREZO THAT THE U.S. POSITION IN THIS REGARD DIFFERS FROM THAT OF MOST COUNTRIES WITHIN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY: ALL THESE ACTIONS THE UNITED STATES POINTING THE FINGER TO HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES ARE AIMED AT IN GENEVA, BECAUSE I HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT WHAT IT WANTS AT THIS TIME IS TO HAVE GUATEMALA CONDEMNED AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT TARNISH OUR INTERNATIONAL IMAGE, BECAUSE THE SUCCESS OF THE ESQUIPULAS II PLAN GAVE GUATEMALA, AS AN AUTONOMOUS AND INDEPENDENT COUNTRY, A LOT OF ROOM FOR ACTION. THAT IS WHAT IT WANTS TO DO, BECAUSE IT IS NOT GOOD FOR LARGE COUNTRIES TO SEE COUNTRIES LIKE GUATEMALA, WITH A CERTAIN DEGREE OF AUTONOMY AND INDEPENDENCE, ACHIEVE HISTORIC SUCCESSES BY SHOWING THAT OUR COUNTRY IS RIGHT IN DISCUSSIONS WITH CERTAIN U.S. GROUPS. THEY NOW WANT . MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT THEY NOW SORT OF WANT TO GET BACK AT US FOR THE ESQUIPULAS II PLAN. IN REPLY TO THESE STATEMENTS BY PRESIDENT CEREZO, THE U.S. EMBASSY POINTED OUT IN ITS COMMUNIQUE OF 6 MARCH THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAD SUPPORTED THE ESQUIPULAS II PEACE PROCESS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. IT ADDED THAT EVER SINCE THE SIGNING OF THE ESQUIPULAS ACCORD, GUATEMALA HAS RECEIVED $600 MILLION IN U.S. AID. THIS SHOWS, ACCORDING TO THE EMBASSY, THAT U.S. SUPPORT FOR GUATEMALAN DEMOCRACY CONTINUED TO BE STRONG AFTER THE SIGNING OF THE ESQUIPULAS II DOCUMENT. IN ANY CASE, FROM PRESIDENT CEREZO'S PERSPECTIVE THE U.S. ATTITUDE IN THIS SITUATION REFLECTS THE TRADITIONAL INCLINATION OF THAT COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT HISTORY TO DICTATE RULES TO OTHER NATIONS REGARDING WHAT THEY SHOULD DO. CEREZO COMPARED GUATEMALA'S SITUATION IN MATTERS OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION TO THE SITUATION IN SEVERAL U.S. CITIES WHERE THE POLICE ARE UNABLE TO CONTROL CRIME. AS AN EXAMPLE, HE CITED WASHINGTON, D.C., WHERE ASSAULTS, MURDERS, AND CRIMES FREQUENTLY RELATED TO DRUG CONSUMPTION HAVE REACHED VERY ASTONISHING LEVELS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. AS FOR THE DEPARTURE OF AMBASSADOR STROOK, CEREZO SAID THAT THE DIPLOMAT HAS NOT BEEN WITHDRAWN FROM GUATEMALA, BUT RETURNED TO THE UNITED STATES FOR CONSULTATIONS BY ORDER OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT. IN STATEMENTS MADE MINUTES AFTER RECEIVING THE CREDENTIALS OF THE NEW FRG AMBASSADOR, HOWEVER, CEREZO SAID THAT HIS RETURN WAS, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, DUE TO A DECISION WE MADE.
TST3-MUC4-0091	SANTIAGO, 21 MAR 90 -- GENERAL GUSTAVO LEIGH GUZMAN, A FORMER MILITARY REGIME GOVERNMENT JUNTA MEMBER AND FORMER COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE AIR FORCE, AND AIR FORCE GENERAL ENRIQUE RUIZ, RETIRED, A PARTNER IN LEIGH'S REAL ESTATE OFFICE, WERE SERIOUSLY INJURED DURING AN ATTACK THIS MORNING. ACCORDING TO WITNESSES' REPORTS, TWO 23 TO 25-YEAR-OLD INDIVIDUALS WALKED TO GEN. LEIGH'S OFFICE, ON THE FOURTH FLOOR OF THE BUILDING LOCATED AT 95 LUIS TALLE OJEDA STREET. WITNESSES SAID THEY HEARD TWO BURSTS OF GUNFIRE: ONE BURST OF THREE SHOTS LASTING THREE SECONDS AND ANOTHER BURST OF SEVEN TO EIGHT SHOTS LASTING LONGER. GEN. LEIGH'S SECRETARY, JOANNA SANTIS RETAMAL, CAME TO A WINDOW TO REPORT THE INCIDENT. OTHER REPORTS SAID THAT THE TWO INDIVIDUALS BROKE INTO THE OFFICES AND ENTERED GEN. LEIGH'S PRIVATE OFFICE. THE INDIVIDUALS USED 9 MM SEMIAUTOMATIC PISTOLS. ACCORDING TO THE EXPERTS, GEN. RUIZ WAS HIT THREE TIMES AND GEN GUSTAVO LEIGH WAS HIT FIVE TIMES. THE BULLETS HIT GEN. LEIGH IN HIS EYE, NOSE, RIGHT ARM, RIGHT LEG, AND STOMACH. THE TWO ATTACKERS THEN WALKED DOWN THE STAIRS AND ESCAPED TOWARD PROVIDENCIA. THE GOVERNMENT HAS EXPRESSED ITS STRONG CONDEMNATION OF THE ATTACK ON GEN. GUSTAVO LEIGH, THE FORMER COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE AIR FORCE AND MEMBER OF THE MILITARY REGIME'S GOVERNMENT JUNTA. ON HIS WAY TO THE HOSPITAL ON EXPRESS ORDERS OF THE PRESIDENT, INTERIOR MINISTER ENRIQUE KRAUSS REJECTED THE ATTACK: WE HAVE ASKED THE POLICE AUTHORITIES TO FULLY CLARIFY THIS INCIDENT. THESE ATTITUDES AND ACTS DO NOT HELP IN THE EFFORT REQUIRED TO REUNITE ALL CHILEANS. KRAUSS SAID IT WAS A REGRETTABLE INCIDENT BECAUSE IT HURT THE SPIRIT AND PURPOSE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION'S WORK. THE ATTACK AGAINST LEIGH WOULD MAKE A GOOD PATHOLOGICAL STUDY, THE MINISTER ADDED. THE NATIONAL COORDINATING BOARD FOR POLITICAL PRISONERS HAS SAID THE ATTACK ON GUSTAVO LEIGH DOES NOT REFLECT THE CURRENT SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY. COMMUNIST PARTY LEADER JORGE MARTINEZ, MOVEMENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY LEFT LEADER CARLOS RUIG, AND MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT LEADER FRANCISCO ESCOBAR HEARD THE NEWS WHILE HOLDING A NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE PRISON HOUSE. THE FPMR'S FRANCISCO ESCOBAR SAID HE IS SURE HIS ORGANIZATION WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT BECAUSE, AS HE SAID, WE ARE NOT GOING TO ACHIEVE ANYTHING WITH IT. MIR REPRESENTATIVE CARLOS RUIG SAID THAT THE MIR WOULD NOT CARRY OUT ANY ARMED ACTION AT THIS TIME, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE LEVEL OF GEN. LEIGH'S INVOLVEMENT IN PAST REPRESSIONS. COMMUNIST LEADER JORGE MARTINEZ SAID THAT HE IS COMMITTED TO RESPECTING THE DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION. HE SAID THAT HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS TYPE OF ACTION WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE COUNTRY'S PROGRESS AND STABILITY.
TST3-MUC4-0092	PANAMA CITY , 21 MAR 90 -- THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT IS PREPARED TO FACE A RUPTURE OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH MEXICO AND PERU TO ENFORCE THE LAW, FOREIGN MINISTER DR. JULIO E. LINARES ASSERTED WHEN REFERRING TO FORMER COLLABORATORS OF FORMER GENERAL NORIEGA WHO SOUGHT SHELTER IN THESE EMBASSIES SEVERAL WEEKS AGO. THE MEXICAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA CITY HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS GRANTED DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM TO RAFAEL AROSEMENA, FORMER MANAGER OF THE NATIONAL BANK OF PANAMA. HOWEVER, THE PANAMANIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THEY WOULD NOT GRANT HIM A SAFECONDUCT TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY, AND THEY SENT A NOTE TO THE MEXICAN EMBASSY URGING IT TO DESIST FROM OFFERING HIM PROTECTION. ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE, RAFAEL AROSEMENA IS INVOLVED IN AUTHORIZING THE PAYMENT OF CHECKS FOR $12 MILLION, MADE OUT TO CASH BY FORMER COLONEL MARCOS JUSTINES. MEANWHILE, HERACLIDES SUCRE AND GONZALO GONZALEZ, FORMER MAJORS IN THE NOW DEFUNCT DEFENSE FORCES, HAVE SOUGHT ASYLUM AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA CITY. THEY ARE ACCUSED OF KILLING MAJOR MOISES GIROLDI, WHO LED THE FOILED COUP D'ETAT AGAINST NORIEGA IN OCTOBER 1989. "WE ARE WILLING TO PAY WHATEVER PRICE IS NECESSARY TO ENFORCE THE LAW, BECAUSE THESE POLITICAL REFUGEES ARE COMMON CRIMINALS AND THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO THAT BENEFIT," LINARES STATED WHEN ASKED BY CRITICA LIBRE IF PANAMA WOULD BE WILLING TO STOP THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOUGHT ASYLUM AT THE MEXICAN AND PERUVIAN EMBASSIES FROM LEAVING THE COUNTRY WITHOUT FACING A TRIAL FOR THE CRIMES THEY REPORTEDLY PERPETRATED DURING THE PREVIOUS REGIME. LINARES SAID THAT PANAMA WILL MAINTAIN ITS POSITION OF NOT GRANTING SAFE-CONDUCTS TO THESE REFUGEES, EVEN IF THE MEXICAN AND PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT INSIST ON GRANTING THEM DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM, AND ADMITTED THAT THIS WILL LIKELY CREATE AN INTERNATIONAL CONFLICT. NEVERTHELESS, LINARES SAID THAT HE HOPES THERE WILL BE NO NEED TO BREAK DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH EITHER OF THESE COUNTRIES, WHICH INSIST ON KEEPING FORMER COLLABORATORS OF FORMER GEN NORIEGA AS REFUGEES, AND HE EMPHASIZED THE NEED TO REACH AN UNDERSTANDING WITH THESE NATIONS. "WE HOPE THAT RELATIONS WITH MEXICO WILL NOT COOL OFF OR REACH A BREAKING POINT GIVEN THE AFFECTION THAT UNITES US AS FREE NATIONS," LINARES ADDED. HE REVEALED THAT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY SENT A NOTE TO THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT STATING THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO GIVE DIPLOMATI PROTECTION TO THE REFUGEES IN ITS EMBASSY, BECAUSE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS WERE STARTED AGAINST THEM AFTER THEY HAD BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE DIPLOMATIC MISSION. "WE ARE PREPARING A NOTE OF REPLY TO THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT," FOREIGN MINISTER LINARES SAID. THE FOLLOWING PERSONS ARE STILL REFUGEES AT THE ECUADORAN EMBASSY: FORMER PUBLIC WORKS MINISTER RENE BULTRON, FORMER LABOR MINISTER CESAR MARTANS, FORMER NATIONAL MORTGAGE BANK MANAGER JULIO SHAIK, FORMER IRHE DIRECTOR LEOVIGILDO HERRRERA, AND FORMER TOURISM DIRECTOR BERNARDO DOMINGUEZ. LAST WEEK THE FOREIGN MINISTER REVIEWED THE POSSIBILITY OF GRANTING SAFE-CONDUCTS TO FIVE OF THESE FORMER OFFICIALS IN THE PREVIOUS REGIME, PROVIDED THERE IS NO CASE PENDING AGAINST THEM. ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL, THESE REFUGEES FACE CHARGES FOR PLOTTING AGAINST THE STATE'S SECURITY, A POLITICAL CRIME. REFERRING TO THE CASE OF FORMER LEGISLATOR LUIS GOMEZ, WHO SOUGHT ASYLUM AT THE CUBAN EMBASSY, LINARES SAID THEY WILL HAVE TO MAKE AN EVALUATION.

THE COMMUNIQUE HAS BEEN SIGNED BY ALL THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES OF THE COUNTRY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE LIBERAL PARTY. THE COMMUNIQUE ASKS THE GOVERNMENT TO OFFER FULL GUARANTEES DURING THE ELECTIONS PROCESS AND TO POSTPONE THE ELECTIONS. THE FOLLOWING IS THE COMMUNIQUE THAT HAS BEEN ISSUED IN THE ELIPTICO ROOM OF THE NATIONAL CAPITOL: WE REPORT TO THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE AND THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD THE FOLLOWING: 1. WE ONCE AGAIN CONDEMN THE VILE MURDER OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DR. BERNARDO JARAMILLO. THIS MURDER HAS MADE EVIDENT THE LACK OF GUARANTEES IN THE COUNTRY, GUARANTEES THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS SYSTEMATICALLY DENIED THE OPPOSITION PARTIES. WE REJECT THE MANIPULATIONS IN WHICH OFFICIAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE ENGAGED IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTIGATING THIS CRIME. 2. WE DENOUNCE THAT THE OFFICIAL APPARATUS IS AT THE SERVICE OF ONLY ONE CANDIDATE AND THAT IT IS PREPARED TO ESTABLISH PARTY PREDOMINANCE THAT WOULD IN PRACTICE BE A REJECTION OF DEMOCRATIC PLURALISM. 3.

UNDER THE CURRENT CONDITIONS, WE ASK OUR REPRESENTATIVES IN THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL TO ABSTAIN FROM PARTICIPATING IN DISCUSSIONS AND DECISIONS OF THAT COUNCIL. 6. IN VIEW OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, WE HAVE AGREED TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND OUR ELECTION CAMPAIGNS AND DEMAND A POSTPONEMENT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR 27 MAY. 7. WE INSIST THAT THE RATIFICATION OF CARLOS LEMOS SIMMONDS IN THE GOVERNMENT MINISTRY REPRESENTS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE TO THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION TO FINDING AN INSTITUTIONAL INTERLOCUTOR IN NATIONAL GOVERNMENT. 8. WE ANNOUNCE THE IMMEDIATE PRESENCE OF INTERNATIONAL TO VERIFY THAT THE ELECTORAL GUARANTEES WE ARE DEMANDING ARE GRANTED AND TO OBSERVE THE ELECTIONS PROCESS. 9. THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE OF THE OPPOSITION HEREBY STATES ITS DECISION TO WORK FOR THE FORMATION OF A CONSTITUENT NATIONAL ASSEMBLY THAT MUST HAVE A DEMOCRATIC AND PLURALISTIC COMPOSITION WITH THE DECIDING PARTICIPATION OF THE NATIONAL TO APPROVE A NEW CONSTITUTION AND TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD FINDING POLITICAL SOLUTIONS TO THE SOCIAL CONFLICT OF COLOMBIA. WE APPEAL TO THE LEADERS OF THE COUNTRY TO URGE THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TO DEFEND AND RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS. 10. WE REITERATE OUR POSITION THAT THE ONLY WAY OUT OF THE ARMED CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY IS A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION. 11. WE URGE THE LIBERAL PARTY TO POSTPONE ITS NATIONAL CONVENTION IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE PATRIOTIC UNION AND THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE. 12. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH'S CALL AND WE WILL PROMOTE THIS CALL THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE. 13. IN DEFENSE OF A PLURALISTIC DEMOCRACY WE WILL MAINTAIN THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE OF THE OPPOSITION WE HAVE CREATED. WE HEREBY ASK OUR FOLLOWERS AND ALL OUR COUNTRYMEN TO REMAIN ON A STATE OF ALERT. THIS COMMITTEE WILL HOLD A NEW MEETING TUESDAY 27 MARCH, AT 1500, IN THE CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES. WE URGE ALL POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES INTERESTED IN THESE OBJECTIVES TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THIS MEETING. RESOLUTION; DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM, THE POPULAR MOVEMENT , THE BROAD FRONT , THE NATIONALIST ACTION FOR PEACE, AND THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT WANT TO LEAVE ON RECORD THE FOLLOWING: THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS BETWEEN THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND M-19 THAT BEGAN ON 10 JANUARY 1989 AND THAT PRODUCED ON 9 MARCH 1990 A PEACE AGREEMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE MURDER OF BERNARDO JARAMILLO, BUT WILL NOT RESULT IN AN END TO THE SEARCH FOR PEACE BY THE TWO PARTIES. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE ARMED CONFLICT IN COLOMBIA.

TST3-MUC4-0096	BOGOTA, 26 APR 90 -- GOOD AFTERNOON, WE HAVE JUST RECEIVED A STATEMENT ISSUED BY PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS CONCERNING THE MURDER OF MR. CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ. THE MESSAGE READS AS FOLLOWS: CARLOS PIZARRO'S MURDER IS A MONSTROUS CRIME THAT HAS CUT SHORT THE LIFE OF A MAN WHO HAD SHOWN HIS WILL FOR PEACE AND HIS COMMITMENT TO COLOMBIA. THE CRIME WAS DIRECTED AT HINDERING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS AND DESTROYING THE RECONCILIATION PROCESS THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND M-19 CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED, SURPASSING MANY OBSTACLES. IN THIS CASE, AS IN MANY OTHERS, THIS PAINFUL TRAGEDY SHOULD SERVE TO CONSOLIDATE THE IDEALS OF PEACE AND PLURALISM FOR WHICH SO MANY COLOMBIANS HAVE STRUGGLED -- ONE OF THEM, CARLOS PIZARRO. IT SHOULD SERVE TO REASSERT OUR REPUDIATION OF VIOLENCE AND OUR FAITH IN DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURES. FURTHER ON THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE NOTES: PIZARRO'S RELATIVES AND HIS FOLLOWERS KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT, AND I PERSONALLY, FEEL STRONG WRATH AND SADNESS, BUT WE WILL NOT BE DISCOURAGED. WE WILL UPHOLD THE BANNERS OF RECONCILIATION, PLURALISM, AND THE RIGHT TO FREELY AND PEACEFULLY EXPRESS ANY IDEA. WE WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO UNMASK AND COMBAT ENEMIES OF PEACE. THE PRESIDENT ADDS IN HIS MESSAGE: I INTERPRET THE DESIRE OF ALL COLOMBIANS WHO ADMIRED CARLOS PIZARRO'S DEMOCRATIC VOCATION, BY WARNING THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS TRAGIC MURDER THAT THEY WILL NOT MANAGE TO DESTROY WHAT HAS BEEN WORKED FOR SO HARD AND WITH THE SUPPORT OF POLITICAL FORCES AND THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR PEACE ON 11 MARCH TO OPEN A ROAD FOR PEACE THAT IS CLEAR, POSSIBLE, AND DEFINED. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE CONTINUES: YOU KNOW THAT DURING THIS PEACE PROCESS, MANY ENEMIES AND DIFFICULTIES WERE SURPASSED, BUT NONE HAS BEEN SO LARGE AS THIS TRAGEDY THAT HAS SHAKEN ALL COLOMBIANS. THE OBLIGATION THAT LIES BEFORE US IS TO KEEP OPEN THE ROAD TO PEACE THAT THE MURDERERS OF CARLOS PIZARRO WANT TO DESTROY. ARTICLE 95 OF THE ELECTORAL CODE INDICATES THAT WHEN A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DIES, ANOTHER PERSON IN HIS OWN MOVEMENT HAS THE RIGHT TO TAKE HIS PLACE. IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS NORM, THE GOVERNMENT WILL OFFER EVERY FACILITY FOR THE REGISTRY OF A NEW M-19 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, SO THAT HE CAN CONTINUE TO HOIST THE FLAGS OF PEACE AND PLURALISM AS IS PROPER FOR A DEMOCRATIC DEBATE. THE PRESIDENT ALSO SAYS IN HIS MESSAGE: I HAVE ASKED THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER AND THE PEACE ADVISER TO MEET AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WITH M-19 REPRESENTATIVES SO THAT TOGETHER THEY MAY STUDY ALTERNATIVES TO CONFRONT SUCH A SERIOUS SITUATION. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER WILL ALSO DIRECT CONTACTS WITH THE REST OF THE POLITICAL FORCES TO REQUEST THEIR OPINIONS ABOUT THE PRESENT SITUATION AND TO CONTINUE TO GIVE ALL THE NECESSARY GUARANTEES SO THAT THE ELECTORAL PROCESS MAY DEVELOP ACCORDING TO WHAT IS ESTABLISHED IN THE CONSTITUTION AND OUR LAWS. THE MESSAGE ENDS: I INVITE ALL COLOMBIANS WHO ARE TIRED OF SO MUCH VIOLENCE TO COME TO THE POLLS IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS AND VOTE FOR PEACE AND PLURALISM. I INVITE ALL POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES TO JOIN IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE ELECTORAL PROCESS AND DEFEND THE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE THREATENED BY VIOLENCE. IT IS TIME FOR GOOD SENSE AND PRUDENCE. IT IS TIME TO RISE TO THE OCCASION AND SHOW OUR COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY. THIS IS THE TEXT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S MESSAGE ON THE MURDER MR. CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ.
TST3-MUC4-0097	SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 90 -- GUERRILLA GROUPS HAVE REPORTED 185 SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES CASUALTIES DURING CLASHES WHICH OCCURRED IN THE LAST FEW HOURS IN SIX OF THE COUNTRY'S 14 DEPARTMENTS, BUT THE ARMY CLAIMS THAT IT ONLY SUSTAINED 48 CASUALTIES IN THOSE CLASHES. ACCORDING TO RADIO FARABUNDO MARTI, A RADIO STATION OF THE GUERRILLA GROUP, THE CASUALTIES WERE SUSTAINED BY THE ARMED FORCES IN CLASHES WHICH OCCURRED ON 1 AND 2 MAY AND EARLY THIS MORNING WHEN SEVERAL AMBUSHES, ATTACKS, AND SABOTAGE AIMED AT THE ECONOMY WERE CARRIED OUT IN SEVERAL PLACES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. RADIO FARABUNDO MARTI HAS REPORTED THAT THE MILITARY ACTIONS, THE LARGEST SINCE THE REBEL OFFENSIVE IN NOVEMBER 1989, WHICH RESULTED IN THOUSANDS OF CASUALTIES, IS PART OF THE "WITH THE WORKERS AND FOR DEMOCRACY" MILITARY CAMPAIGN. THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT , WHICH DOES NOT GIVE DETAILS ON ITS CASUALTIES, HAS SAID THAT THE ARMED FORCES SUSTAINED 30 CASUALTIES IN ILOBASCO, CABANAS DEPARTMENT, LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 55 KM FROM SAN SALVADOR. NEVERTHELESS, ACCORDING TO MILITARY REPORTS ISSUED EIGHT HOURS AFTER THE CLASHES IN THAT TOWN, THE ARMED FORCES KILLED 11 GUERRILLA MEMBERS AND SUSTAINED SIX CASUALTIES. RADIO FARABUNDO MARTI HAS ALSO REPORTED THAT THE GUERRILA FORCES CAUSED 28 ARMY CASUALTIES IN CLASHES ON 2 MAY IN LA LAGUNA, CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT, LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 90 KM NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR. THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE ADMITTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS SUSTAINED 11 CASUALTIES IN THESE CLASHES, ADDING THAT THEY INFLICTED THREE CASUALTIES ON THE REBELS. COPREFA ALSO REPORTED THAT 26 HOUSES WERE DAMAGED. COPREFA ALSO REPORTS THAT MILITARY ACTIONS HAVE OCCURRED IN CABANAS, LA LIBERTAD, CHALATENANGO, SANTA ANA, LA LIBERTAD, AND SAN SALVADOR DEPARTMENTS DURING THE PAST TWO DAYS. IN SOME PLACES THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS WERE SABOTAGED, CAUSING LONG BLACKOUTS. THE GUERRILLA FORCES' GENERAL COMMAND ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE IN SAN SALVADOR ON 2 MAY, STATING THAT THE MILITARY ACTIONS ARE IN RESPONSE TO "THE TRIUMPHANT AND ARROGANT ATTITUDE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE MILITARY, FOR THE FMLN'S ALLEGED WEAKNESS, WHICH PRECLUDES THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS." THE COMMUNIQUE REASSERTS THEIR WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS WITH THE GOVERNMENT TO END A WAR WHICH HAS LASTED MORE THAN A DECADE. THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS IS BEING UNDERTAKEN WITH THE MEDIATION OF UN SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR. PEREZ DE CUELLAR'S SPECIAL ENVOY, ALVARO DE SOTO, ARRIVED IN SAN SALVADOR ON 2 MAY AS PART OF THE NEGOTIATIONS. HE MET WITH PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE COMMISSION TODAY, AND LATER HE WILL MEET WITH OTHER LEADERS. GUILLERMO UNGO, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT , TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT OPPOSITION LEADERS COULD "POSSIBLY" MEET WITH FMLN DELEGATES IN MEXICO CITY TO LEARN THEIR VIEWS CONCERNING THE NEGOTIATIONS. "THE MEETING WILL HAVE AN OPEN AGENDA SO THAT EVERYONE'S POSITION CAN BE HEARD AND SO THAT THE ROLE OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATIONS CAN BE DETERMINED," UNGO SAID.
TST3-MUC4-0098	SAN SALVADOR, 7 MAY 90 -- SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI STATED TODAY THAT IT WOULD BE NO PROBLEM FOR THE FOURTH PENAL JUDGE, WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE CASE OF THE JESUITS MURDERED BY A GROUP OF SOLDIERS, TO ORDER THAT CADETS WHO ARE TAKING COURSES ABROAD RETURN TO THE COUNTRY. IT WAS RECENTLY REPORTED THAT SEVERAL OFFICERS WHO TESTIFIED DURING THESE INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOW ATTENDING TRAINING COURSES ABROAD. IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT THE MILITARY SCHOOL'S REGISTRATION BOOK FOR PERSONS ENTERING OR LEAVING THE PREMISES HAD BEEN LOST, INCLUDING THE PAGES THAT CORRESPOND TO NOVEMBER 1989. TODAY, CRISTIANI TALKED ABOUT THIS MATTER AND SAID THE JUDGE SHOULD CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE AND NOT JUST MAKE STATEMENTS CONCERNING THE PROBLEMS. I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS ANY PROBLEM IN THE OFFICERS RETURNING TO THE COUNTRY IF A JUDGE ORDERS THAT THEY COME TO TESTIFY. ALL THAT IS REQUIRED IS FOR THE JUDGE TO SUMMON THEM; THEY WOULD BE BROUGHT TO THE COUNTRY TO TESTIFY AND, AFTER THAT, RETURNED TO THEIR TRAINING COURSES. GROUPS OF SOLDIERS ARE FREQUENTLY SENT ABROAD TO TAKE TRAINING COURSES TO MAKE THEM MORE PROFESSIONAL; THIS APPLIES NOT ONLY TO PERSONNEL FROM THE MILITARY SCHOOL, BUT FROM ALL ARMED FORCES UNITS. CONCERNING THE OTHER MATTER, THE JUDGE HAS TO INVESTIGATE IT. I BELIEVE THAT INSTEAD OF JUST STAYING THERE, THE JUDGE SHOULD CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR EVIDENCE. TELL ME, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IF THEY ARE BROUGHT BACK FROM SUCHITOTO OR FROM THE UNITED STATES IF THEY MUST TESTIFY BEFORE THE JUDGE? THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL. THE PRESIDENT SPOKE TODAY AT THE EL SALVADOR MILITARY AIRPORT BEFORE HE LEFT FOR COSTA RICA TO ATTEND THE INAUGURATION CEREMONY OF PRESIDENT-ELECT RAFAEL CALDERON FOURNIER. HE ALSO SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES CONDITIONING 50 PERCENT OF THE AID GIVEN TO OUR COUNTRY COULD CAUSE THE REBEL FRONT TO INCREASE THEIR ACTIONS. HE ACCUSED THE FMLN OF USING DIALOGUE FOR TACTICAL REASONS. WE HAVE STATED THAT AN ACTION OF THIS TYPE WOULD BE VERY UNTIMELY, AS IT COULD MAKE THE MOST RADICAL FMLN MEMBERS DECIDE TO CONTINUE THE WAR AND, THUS, HINDER THE DIALOGUE PROCESS. HOWEVER, PRESSURE GOVERNMENT FOR THEM WITH FMLN. I WOULD ASK THE QUESTION: WHO HAS ALWAYS SHOWED GOODWILL AND SINCERELY SOUGHT AN AGREEMENT AND WHO HAS NOT DONE THIS? HISTORY SHOWS THAT IN THE PAST, THE FMLN HAS USED THE PROPOSALS BY DUARTE'S GOVERNMENT AND MY OWN FOR TACTICAL REASONS. IT HAS NOT BEEN THE GOVERNMENTS. I BELIEVE THAT THE FMLN MUST UNDERSTAND AND BE PRESSURED TO REALLY SEARCH FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION. ALSO TODAY, THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL AUTHORIZED A SPOKESMAN TO ANNOUNCE THAT TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND FMLN WILL BE RENEWED ON 16 MAY. THE PANORAMA THAT SURROUNDS THIS NEW ENCOUNTER, HOWEVER, PRESENTS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PATTERN FROM MEETINGS IN THE PAST, BECAUSE BOTH SECTORS HAVE MET WITH POLITICAL PARTIES REPRESENTED AT THE . FURTHERMORE, ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT DONE THE SAME WITH THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL FORCES, THE REBELS WILL TRY TO DO SO THIS WEEK. UNDOUBTEDLY, THE RESULTS THAT COULD BE OBTAINED FROM THE DIALOGUE COULD BE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THOSE OBTAINED DURING PAST NEGOTIATIONS, BECAUSE ALMOST ALL THE SECTORS THAT HAVE BECOME INVOLVED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN THE NEGOTIATING DEMAND THAT THE AGREEMENTS ATTAINED BE BASED ON INTERNAL COOPERATION.
TST3-MUC4-0099	SAN SALVADOR, 1 JUN 90 -- OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE REPORTED BLACKOUTS IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF GUERRILLAS SABOTAGING THE ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEM DURING THE NIGHT OF 31 MAY AND THE MORNING OF 1 JUNE.

ON THE MORNING OF 1 JUNE, THERE WAS A BLACKOUT THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE CAPITAL CAUSED BY URBAN COMMANDOS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT . THE GUERRILLAS HAVE INCREASED THEIR ACTIVITY ON THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT. CRISTINAI IS SCHEDULED TO ADDRESS THE NATION ON 1 JUNE TO COMMENT ON HIS FIRST YEAR IN OFFICE. THE ARMY HAS INCREASED ITS PATROLS AIDED BY HELICOPTERS THAT OVERFLY THE CAPITAL CITY. COPREFA REPORTED THAT ONE SOLDIER WAS KILLED AND SEVEN WERE WOUNDED ON 1 JUNE DURING AN AMBUSH OF A MILITARY CONVOY NEAR TEXISTEPEQUE, WEST OF SAN SALVADOR.

MUNOZ, WHO IS DEPUTY FOR THE FEDERAL DISTRICT, SAID THAT "CRISTIANI IS THE HEAD OF A REPRESSIVE GOVERNMENT THAT IS GUILTY OF FLAGRANT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS." HE SAID THAT "THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT CRISTIANI WAS INVOLVED IN THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS" WHICH OCCURRED ON 16 NOVEMBER IN SAN SALVADOR. HE ALSO REFERRED TO THE "ILLEGAL" ARREST ON 31 MAY OF MEXICAN PROFESSOR MARIA EUGNEIA OCHOA GARCIA, WHOM THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT ACCUSED OF HAVING CONNECTIONS WITH THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS. SHE WAS RELEASED ON 7 JUNE.

ACCORDING TO CARBONE, NO MEASURES WERE TAKEN TO MAKE THE INMATES STOP RIOTING, NOR WAS AN OPERATION PLANNED TO REGAIN CONTROL OVER INMATES, AND THE KILLING WAS NOT STOPPED BY THE OFFICERS WHO WERE THERE. PROSECUTOR CARBONE ALSO REQUESTED 6 YEARS FOR GENERAL JORGE RABANAL, WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE OPERATION, "BECAUSE HE COULD HAVE PREVENTED THE MASSACRE HAD HE COORDINATED ACTIONS WITH GEN CABEZAS."
TST4-MUC4-0003	LIMA, 23 AUG 88 -- TODAY PERUVIAN MILITARY OFFICIALS ESTABLISHED A CURFEW IN TINGO MARIA BECAUSE OF THE STRIKE BY PEASANTS AND COCA GROWERS TO PROTEST THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR COCA FIELDS.

AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT, GOLCHER WAS ACCOMPANIED BY U.S. MILITARY ATTACHE ANGEL MENENDEZ. THE INCIDENT OCCURRED AT 0100 ON 26 AUGUST AT THE INTERSECTION OF WEST 1ST STREET AND NORTH 51ST AVENUE. COL GOLCHER WAS SUPPOSEDLY IN ISRAEL WHERE HE WAS SENT AS THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT'S MILITARY ATTACHE; HOWEVER, THE WELL-KNOWN LEADER OF THE DEATH SQUADS WAS SEEN AT 0100 IN DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR ACCOMPANIED BY NONE OTHER THAN THE U.S. MILITARY REPRESENTATIVE IN OUR COUNTRY. THIS HAPPENED ONLY HOURS AFTER COLONEL MAJANO'S BODYGUARDS WERE MURDERED. THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THIS INCIDENT RAISE SEVERAL QUESTIONS. WHAT WERE THESE TWO SOLDIERS DOING AT 0100? WHERE WERE GOLCHER'S BODYGUARDS? WHERE WERE HIS COMPANION'S BODYGUARDS? THE TWO MEN WERE PROBABLY RETURNING FROM A CORRUPTION CENTER, A NIGHT CLUB--ONE OF THOSE EXCLUSIVE CLUBS WHERE THE U.S. ADVISERS AND OTHER U.S. AND SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SPEND THE DOLLARS THEY STEAL FROM THE FUNDS ALLOTTED TO EL SALVADOR AND WHERE THEY PLAN CRIMES AGAINST THE PEOPLE. MUCH MORE COULD BE SAID; HOWEVER, THE TRUTH IS THAT THE INCIDENT WAS NO MERE ACCIDENT. MRS PLATERO IS ANOTHER VICTIM OF THE MADNESS AFFECTING AN ARMY DIRECTED BY U.S. ADVISERS. THERE IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS INCIDENT AND THE HURLING OF A GRENADE BY A SOLDIER DRIVEN CRAZY BY THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TERRORISM PRACTICED BY THE ARMY ADVISERS AND CHIEFS. THERE IS NO DOUBT IN OUR MINDS THAT GOLCHER WILL NOT BE TRIED FOR THIS NEW CRIME, JUST AS HE HAS NOT BEEN TRIED FOR THE MANY CRIMES HE HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR AS CHIEF OF THE REPRESSIVE CORPS AND DEATH SQUADS.
TST4-MUC4-0006	SAN SALVADOR, 25 AUG 88 -- A CORPORAL AND A GUERRILLA HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE MOST RECENT CLASHES BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE FMLN.

ACCORDING TO MILITARY AUTHORITIES, A LIEUTENANT AND FIVE CIVILIANS WHO WERE PASSING THROUGH THE AREA AT THE TIME WERE INJURED BY THE EXPLOSION. MEANWHILE, TROOPS OF THE CIVIPLAN BATTALION KILLED AN FMLN GUERRILLA IN A SKIRMISH ON THE SLOPES OF LA CRUZ HILL IN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT. RESIDENTS OF QUETZALTEPEQUE REPORTED THAT THE REBELS DOWNED AN ELECTRIC TOWER LAST NIGHT ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE TOWN.
TST4-MUC4-0007	MANAGUA , 27 AUG 88 -- THE GENERAL MANAGEMENT OF AEROLINEAS DE NICARAGUA, AERONICA, CONDEMNED YESTERDAY'S ATTACK ON ITS REGIONAL OFFICES IN GUATEMALA CITY. AERONICA GENERAL MANAGER JULIO ROCHA SAID: WE CONDEMN THESE TERRORIST ACTIONS, ENDORSED BY U.S. IMPERIALISM. HE DESCRIBED THE ACTION AS A POLITICAL ATTACK. ONCE AGAIN WE HAVE WITNESSED ACTIONS BY GUATEMALAN RIGHTIST SECTORS WHICH, ENDORSED BY U.S. IMPERIALISM, ARE TRYING TO INTIMIDATE US AND TO BLOCK THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR NATIONAL AIRLINE, ROCHA ADDED. THE GENERAL MANAGER ADDED THAT THE GUATEMALAN POLICE ARE IN CHARGE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS TO FIND THE PERPETRATORS OF THE ATTACK WHO, USING AN UNIDENTIFIED VEHICLE, HURLED TWO FRAGMENTATION GRENADES AT AERONICA'S REGIONAL OFFICES IN GUATEMALA CITY.

THIS WAS STATED BY COPPER WORKERS UNION LEADER GUILLERMO MEDINA, WHO SAID THAT ACCORDING TO INFORMATION HE HAS AND WHAT HAS BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE PRESS, IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT SUCH VIOLENT ACTIONS HAVE BEEN PLANNED. MEDINA ALSO SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT DECISION TO LIFT THE STATES OF EXCEPTION IS POSITIVE, ALTHOUGH IT WILL BENEFIT A VOCIFEROUS MINORITY. MEDINA SAID THAT 70 PERCENT OF THE SILENT MAJORITY IS NOT CONCERNED ABOUT LIVING UNDER STATES OF EXCEPTION BECAUSE THEY ARE WORKING PEOPLE CONCERNED ONLY WITH THEIR LABOR ACTIVITIES.
TST4-MUC4-0009	SANTIAGO, 22 AUG 88 -- VERY RELIABLE SECURITY SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT THE CLANDESTINE ENTRY OF FPMR MEMBERS, WHO FOUGHT ALONGSIDE THE MARXIST ANGOLAN GOVERNMENT, HAS RECENTLY BEEN DETECTED IN THE COUNTRY. THE EXTREMISTS, ALL CHILEAN NATIONALS SELECTED FROM FPMR MEMBERS, FIRST COMPLETED THEIR THEORETICAL TRAINING IN GUERRILLA WARFARE IN CUBA BEFORE TRAVELING TO ANGOLA WITH CUBAN TROOPS. THE CUBANS WERE ASSIGNED TO THE DEFENSE OF THE MARXIST GOVERNMENT THAT IS FIGHTING AGAINST THE UNITA REBELS. HAVING FINISHED THEIR PRACTICAL TRAINING IN A COUNTRY WHERE APPROXIMATELY 50,000 TROOPS ARE STATIONED, THESE FPMR TERRORISTS RETURNED TO CUBA, FROM WHERE THEY TRAVELED TO EUROPE, BEFORE FINALLY RETURNING TO CHILEAN TERRITORY. THE SOURCES SAID THAT THESE TERRORISTS ARE "SLEEPERS" AND WILL BE READY TO ACT IN MAJOR TERRORIST OPERATIONS, ABOUT WHICH THE SECURITY SERVICES HAVE SOME INFORMATION.

TST4-MUC4-0011	MANAGUA , 9 AUG 88 -- DEAR MR PRESIDENT: ON THE ROAD TOWARD ACHIEVING PEACE, WE HAVE OFTEN EXPERIENCED SETBACKS AND DIFFICULT TIMES. POWERFUL FORCES ARE TRYING TO JUSTIFY VIOLENCE AND WAR EVERY TIME DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS OR COMMITMENTS ARE NOT FOLLOWED OR MET. WHEN THERE IS AN ARMED STRUGGLE AND WHEN THOUSANDS ARE KILLED ON THE BATTLEFIELD, THOSE WHO PROMOTE VIOLENCE NEVER CONCLUDE FROM THOSE USELESS KILLINGS THAT WAR IS FUTILE. THEY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT PEACE CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION. IT WILL ALWAYS BE EASIER TO RECTIFY MISTAKES WHEN THE WEAKNESSES ARE POLITICAL OR WHEN ERRORS ARE MADE ON THE ROAD TO PEACE. WE CANNOT BRING THE DEAD BACK TO LIFE, AND VIOLENCE BORN OF HATRED TAKES A LONG TIME TO HEAL. I BELIEVE, MR PRESIDENT, THAT IT WOULD BE ENCOURAGING IF YOU WERE TO RECTIFY SOME POLITICAL DECISIONS YOUR GOVERNMENT MADE FOLLOWING THE UNFORTUNATE INCIDENTS AT NANDAIME. IT IS IMPORTANT TO REOPEN THE COMMUNICATIONS MEDIA THAT ARE CLOSED. IT IS NECESSARY TO RELEASE THE PRISONERS AND TO REVOKE THE SENTENCES IMPOSED UPON THEM AS PUNISHMENT FOR INVOLVEMENT IN THOSE INCIDENTS. THE PEACE PLAN TO WHICH WE ARE COMMITTED OBLIGES US TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. OUR MOST SACRED COMMITMENT IS TO CONTINUE PROGRESSING ON THE PATH TOWARD DEMOCRATIZATION. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT AND THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS RESUME NEGOTIATIONS TO SECURE A PERMANENT END TO MILITARY ACTIONS IN NICARAGUA. THIS COULD VERY WELL BE AN ENCOURAGING EXAMPLE FOR MANY CENTRAL AMERICAN AND OTHER COUNTRIES. I OFFER YOU OUR COSTA RICAN TERRITORY FOR THE RESUMPTION OF SUCH NEGOTIATIONS. I ALSO OFFER YOU ALL THE ASSISTANCE WITHIN MY MEANS TO ENABLE SUCH NEGOTIATIONS TO TAKE PLACE. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WILL ATTEND THE UPCOMING INAUGURAL CEREMONY IN ECUADOR. I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE A SIGN OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE OF PEACE, A NOBLE GESTURE TOWARD RODRIGO BORJA, AND WOULD AID IN STRENGTHENING THE ECUADORAN DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IF YOU ATTENDED THE CEREMONY IN QUITO AFTER REVERSING THE SETBACKS INCURRED AS A RESULT OF ANTIDEMOCRATIC ACTIONS, SUCH AS PENALIZING THE COMMUNICATIONS MEDIA AND DEPRIVING MEN AND WOMEN OF THEIR LIBERTY. ONLY IF WE HAVE THE STRENGTH TO CORRECT OUR MISTAKES AND THE VISION TO CONTINUE ON THE PATH OUTLINED IN THE PEACE PLAN CAN CENTRAL AMERICANS PREVENT THE CONTINUANCE OF THE ARMED AGGRESSION AGAINST OUR PEOPLES. A LATIN AMERICAN COMMITMENT TO PEACE ALSO REQUIRES EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE INDEPENDENCE AND DEMOCRACY. WE WILL NOT BE GRANTED ANOTHER POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY TO FORGE HISTORY. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THERE WILL BE A NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR RECONCILIATION TO ALLOW TODAY'S YOUTH A DIFFERENT FUTURE, A NEW OPPORTUNITY TO PUT ASIDE THEIR WEAPONS AND TO WORK FOR A BETTER FUTURE.
TST4-MUC4-0012	LIMA, 14 AUG 88 -- TODAY IT WAS REPORTED THAT YESTERDAY THE PERUVIAN POLICE CONFISCATED WEAPONS BELONGING TO THE DEA, A U.S. ORGANIZATION ENGAGED IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.

TST4-MUC4-0013	SAN SALVADOR, 18 AUG 88 -- A JUDGE HAS ORDERED THE RELEASE OF FORMER CAPTAIN ALVARO SANABRIA, WHO IS IMPLICATED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO, BECAUSE OF CONTRADICTORY STATEMENTS BY A KEY WITNESS. COURT SOURCES HAVE EXPLAINED, HOWEVER, THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT WILL NOW HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO ACCEPT THE ACQUITTAL OF THE SOLDIER. THE DECISION ISSUED BY JUSTICE ROMEO AURORA ACQUITTING AND ORDERING THE RELEASE OF THE FORMER CAPTAIN WAS MADE, ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENT, BECAUSE AMADO ANTONIO GARAY REYES--THE ALLEGED DRIVER OF THE PERSON WHO ASSASSINATED MSGR ROMERO--CANNOT BE CONSIDERED A RELIABLE WITNESS. THE JUDGEMENT PRESENTED TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT NOTES THAT THIS WITNESS HAS MADE STATEMENTS THAT CONTRADICT TESTIMONY HE GAVE AT THE 4TH CRIMINAL COURT 7 YEARS AFTER THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED. FOR THIS REASON, THE JUDGE, BASED ON ARTICLES 497 AND 498 OF THE PENAL CODE AND ARTICLE 53 OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCEDURES LAW HAS RULED THAT THERE IS NO MERIT FOR ARRESTING THE MILITARY MAN, WHO HAS BEEN TRIED IN ABSENTIA. HOWEVER, COURT OFFICIALS HAVE EXPLAINED THAT THIS DOCUMENT ISSUED BY JUDGE AURORA IS ONLY A REPORT ON HIS RULING, WHICH ACCORDING TO THE LAW CAN BE EITHER REVOKED OR CONFIRMED BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT. FOR THIS REASON, THIS DECISION IS NOT BEING VIEWED AS A FINAL RULING.
TST4-MUC4-0014	BUENOS AIRES, 18 AUG 88 -- TODAY LUIS CACERES, UCR SECRETARY GENERAL AND A NATIONAL DEPUTY, PROMISED CHILEAN RADICAL PARTY LEADER RICARDO NAVARRETE THAT A DELEGATION OF UCR LEADERS WILL BE SENT TO OBSERVE THE PLEBISCITE THAT WILL DECIDE CHILE'S INSTITUTIONAL FUTURE IN EARLY OCTOBER 1988. DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE HELD WITH THE CHILEAN PR LEADER, WHO SAID THAT AN OPINION CONTRARY TO THE CONTINUATION OF GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET AS CHILEAN PRESIDENT WILL PREVAIL IN THE PLEBISCITE. THE NO VOTE WILL WIN BECAUSE CHILEANS ARE FED UP WITH THE PAST 15 YEARS OF SUFFERING, INCLUDING TORTURE, KILLINGS, AND HUMILIATION, SAID NAVARRETE. HE ADDED THAT THE OPPOSITION WILL MONITOR THE BALLOTING, THUS SAFEGUARDING THE PLEBISCITE FROM ANY FRAUDULENT ACTIONS. ON 30 AUGUST, THE TOP AUTHORITIES IN THE CHILEAN REGIME WILL NOMINATE THEIR CANDIDATE--IT IS TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT IT WILL BE PINOCHET--SO THAT THE CITIZENRY CAN VOTE YES OR NO IN THE PLEBISCITE, THUS DECIDING WHETHER THIS CANDIDATE WILL GOVERN THE COUNTRY FOR THE NEXT 9 YEARS. NAVARRETE ADDED THAT AFTER THE VICTORY OF THE NO VOTE, THE OPPOSITION WILL ASK FOR ANOTHER PLEBISCITE IN ORDER TO AMMEND THE CONSTITUTION PROMULGATED BY THE CURRENT REGIME IN 1980 SO AS TO ENSURE A CALL FOR DEMOCRATIC, FREE, AND OPEN GENERAL ELECTIONS. NEVERTHELESS, NAVARRETE NOTED: IF WE ARE DEFEATED HONESTLY, WE WILL RESPECT THE PLEBISCITE'S OUTCOME, ALTHOUGH WE WILL CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE.

TST4-MUC4-0018	LA PAZ, 16 SEP 88 -- INTERIOR, MIGRATION, AND JUSTICE MINISTER JUAN CARLOS DURAN HAS SAID THAT SINCE 1985 PRESIDENT VICTOR PAZ ESTENSSORO'S ADMINISTRATION MADE GREAT PROGRESS IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING FOR THE BENEFIT OF BOLIVIAN SOCIETY. THE INTERIOR MINISTER SAID THAT THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION HAS OBTAINED GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS IN ITS STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFIKING BY ELIMINATING 80 PERCENT OF THIS ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. DURAN SAID THAT DURING PAZ' ADMINISTRATION ABOUT 1,000 PEOPLE CONNECTED WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING HAVE BEEN ARRESTED, 1,000 COCAINE LABORATORIES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, AND 20 TONS OF DRUGS HAVE BEEN CONFISCATED. HE SAID THAT BOLIVIAN SOCIETY HAS WITNESSED THESE ACHIEVEMENTS AS PART OF THE GOVERNMENT'S EFFORT TO ERADICATE DRUG TRAFFICKING FROM THE NATIONAL TERRITORY. THE INTERIOR MINISTER EXPRESSED GREAT ANNOYANCE AT AN ARTICLE PUBLISHED BY THE NEWSPAPER EL PAIS, OF MADRID, SPAIN, IN WHICH FELIPE KEMPFF, SON OF THE MURDERED BOLIVIAN SCIENTIST NOEL KEMPFF, ASSERTS THAT THE BOLIVIAN AND U.S. GOVERNMENTS ALLOW THE MANUFACTURING OF COCAINE AND USE THE PROCEDES TO FINANCE THE INTERNATIONAL STRUGGLE AGAINST COMMUNISM. DURAN SAID: "I WILL ASK THE DISTRICT PROSECUTOR TO SUMMON FELIPE KEMPFF TO COURT IN ORDER TO MAKE HIM TELL EVERYTHING HE KNOWS. HE MUST SAY TO WHOM THE COCAINE LABORATORIES BELONG, HOW MUCH DRUG IT CAN PROCESS, AND WHOM IT BENEFITS." AFTER FELIPE KEMPFF REPORTED THE ALLEGED EXISTENCE OF A SECOND COCAINE LABORATORY IN HUANCHACA, THE SPECIAL ANTINARCOTICS FORCES RAIDED THE AREA FOR 15 DAYS AND WERE UNABLE TO FIND ANY OTHER LABORATORY EXCEPT FOR ONE THAT WAS DISMANTLED IN 1986, MINISTER DURAN SAID.

TST4-MUC4-0020	SANTIAGO, 22 SEP 88 -- THE CHILEAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMITTEE HAS HANDED GENERAL PINOCHET A PUBLIC PETITION REQUESTING HIM TO EXPLAIN TO THE COUNTRY SOME SERIOUS CRIMES, WHICH CANNOT BE DENIED, THAT OCCURRED DURING HIS TERM IN OFFICE.

THE MALAMBO AREA, CLOSE TO THE BARRANQUILLA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, WHERE THE AIR BASE IS LOCATED, WAS IMMEDIATELY MILITARIZED. GUARDS AT THE SITE REPELLED THE ATTACK, WHICH WAS APPARENTLY STAGED BY GUERRILLAS. SIMILARLY, IT WAS LEARNED THAT A BOMB EXPLODED TODAY AT THE COMMUNIST PARTY HEADQUARTERS IN THE CAPITAL OF CAQUETA, CAUSING CONSIDERABLE PROPERTY DAMAGE.

TST4-MUC4-0022	PISCO, 23 SEP 88 -- LAST NIGHT IN SAN CLEMENTE DISTRICT, 9 KM NORTH OF PISCO, A GROUP OF TERRORISTS DYNAMITED MACHINERY BELONGING TO ALBOLONES PERUANOS, INC.

AFTER DOING SO, THE TERRORISTS FLED FROM THE SITE. MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES RESPONDED AND ASKED FOR SUPPORT FROM THE CITY OF ICA.
TST4-MUC4-0023	PANAMA CITY , 26 SEP 88 -- THE PLAN INCLUDED SEVERAL POINTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PLAN WAS TO PRESSURE GENERAL NORIEGA TO RESIGN FROM HIS MILITARY POST IN LATE AUGUST. THE PSYCHOLOGICAL OBJECTIVES OF THIS PLAN WERE: TO INTENSIFY AND SPREAD THE REPUDIATION OF NORIEGA WITHIN THE FDP; TO INTENSIFY AND SPREAD THE REPUDIATION OF NORIEGA'S COLLABORATORS BY MENTIONING SPECIFIC NAMES; TO CONVINCE NORIEGA THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS REGIME WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE NORIEGA'S PANAMANIAN COLLABORATORS THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS REGIME WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND NORIEGA ALLIES, PARTICULARLY CUBA AND NICARAGUA, THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE GOVERNMENTS THAT WERE HOSTILE TO NORIEGA, ESPECIALLY VENEZUELA AND COLOMBIA, THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS REGIME WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE FOREIGN REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENTS THAT DEALT WITH NORIEGA, SUCH AS THE FMLN AND THE M-19, THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS REGIME WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; AND TO MOVE THE ANTI-NORIEGA SECTOR WITHIN THE FDP TO SUPPORT SPECIFIC ACTIONS AGAINST NORIEGA'S REGIME. THE FDP MEMBERS, OFFICERS, AND TROOPS WERE THE TARGETS OF THIS PLAN. WE SEE HOW SOME WERE TAKEN IN BY THE PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS PLAN. THE TARGETS OF THIS PLAN WERE GEN NORIEGA, NORIEGA'S PANAMANIAN COLLABORATORS WITHIN THE FDP, SOME CIVILIANS, FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE NORIEGA'S ALLIES, FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE HOSTILE TO NORIEGA, AND FOREIGN REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATIONS THAT DEAL WITH NORIEGA. THEY IDENTIFIED ALL OF NORIEGA'S VULNERABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE VULNERABILITIES OF ALL THE TARGETS WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED. THERE WERE CERTAIN THEMES USED IN THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS, AND THE MEDIA FELL FOR THEM MANY TIMES. THIS IS WHY WE REPEATEDLY ASKED THEM NOT TO FALL FOR THIS MISINFORMATION. THESE THEMES INCLUDED: BY IMPOSING HIS ARBITRARY NATURE AND CORRUPTION, NORIEGA IS PERVERTING THE FDP AND PROMOTING THE DISINTEGRATION OF THAT MILITARY INSTITUTION. THE FDP HAVE BECOME A MAFIA THAT IS HEADING TOWARD DISGRACE. THIS IS A TOPIC THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED IN LEAFLETS AND MANY PUBLICATIONS. BY DISRUPTING THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER AT HIS WHIM, NORIEGA IS PROVOKING A PROFOUND SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND POLITICAL CRISIS THAT IS RUINING THE COUNTRY. THIS IS DONE TO HIDE THOSE WHO ARE TRULY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRISIS WE ARE EXPERIENCING. THE LONGER NORIEGA REMAINS IN POWER, THE MORE PROBABLE BECOMES A U.S., CUBAN, OR SOVIET INTERVENTION. THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CONFLICTS PROVOKED BY NORIEGA NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PERSONAL WELL-BEING OF THE FDP MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. NORIEGA'S FALL IS INEVITABLE AND THE FDP SHOULD NOT FALL WITH HIM. TO SAVE THE FDP AND THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA, THE FDP MUST REMOVE NORIEGA FROM OFFICE. THIS IS WHY THERE WERE SIREN SONGS THAT AN INTERNAL COUP WAS UNDER WAY. THE STATE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS CASE FOR 5 MONTHS AND WE KNOW THE FUGITIVES ARE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE KNOW WHERE THEY LEFT FROM. NO ONE CAN DENY THE ASSOCIATION OF CERTAIN U.S. CITIZENS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THIS OPERATION WITH THE PANAMANIAN GROUPS THAT WERE CAPTURED. WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE, THE WEAPONS, THE INSTRUMENTS USED FOR MISINFORMATION, THE PLANS, AND THE MAPS WITH THE TARGETS FOR VIOLENCE. IMPORTANT PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING TO BE KIDNAPPED HAD ALSO BEEN MARKED ON THESE MAPS. THEY HAD MARKED THE BRIDGES THAT WERE TO BE DESTROYED. GENTLEMEN, WE KNOW THE POWER OF WEAPONS AND WE KNOW HOW TO USE THEM. WE KNOW THE DAMAGE THEY CAN DO. THEREFORE, BEFORE THERE WAS A VIOLENT CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE AND THEIR FDP, WE WENT ONE STEP AHEAD OF THEIR PLANS. IF ARRESTS WERE MADE, IT WAS BECAUSE WE WANTED TO AVOID A CONFRONTATION WITH INEXPERIENCED GROUPS THAT ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE USED FOR THE PERSONAL BENEFIT OF THOSE WHO RECEIVED, WITH A SIREN SONG, THE PROMISE OF THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE'S $30 MILLION THAT ERIC ARTURO DELVALLE WAS GOING TO USE FOR SUBVERSIVE ACTS, BLOODY ACTS TO BATHE OUR PEOPLE IN BLOOD, AS IN THE CASE OF THE STRUGGLE OF OUR BROTHER COUNTRIES IN LATIN AND CENTRAL AMERICA. WE WILL NOT PERMIT THAT. THAT IS WHY WE DECIDED TO GO ONE STEP AHEAD AND FOIL THESE PLANS THAT HAVE A CERTAIN PURPOSE AND THAT WOULD RESULT IN MOURNING AND PAIN FOR PANAMANIAN FAMILIES. WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE AND THOSE WHO WERE ARRESTED WERE DAMN WELL ARRESTED: ALBERTO CONTE, FRED BOYD, AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES SO EDUARDO HERRERA AND FRIENDS CAN LIVE LIKE KINGS IN THE UNITED STATETS, SO THEY CAN LIVE THEIR LIVES DRINKING CHAMPAGNE AND EATING PHEASANT. EDUARDO HERRERA WAS DISMISSED FROM A DIPLOMATIC POST FOR SMUGGLING 40 BOXES OF WHISKEY PER WEEK INTO ISRAEL. HE IS THE KIND OF PERSON PROTECTED BY THE PENTAGON AND ELLIOTT ABRAMS. HE IS ELLIOTT ABRAMS' HERO. THERESA WELLINGTON OF THE EMBASSY IN MEXICO, WHO GAVE THESE PEOPLE--WHO LEFT PANAMA FOR MEXICO-- THEIR VISAS IN 10 MINUTES BY ABRAMS' ORDERS, HAS ALSO BECOME ONE OF OUR PEOPLE'S ENEMIES.
TST4-MUC4-0024	SANTIAGO, 28 SEP 88 -- THIS MORNING AT APPROXIMATELY 0630 THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY HEADQUARTERS IN THE CITY OF ARICA WAS ATTACKED. THE PDC'S PREMISES ARE LOCATED AT 683 SOTOMAYOR STREET, IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA OF THE CITY. THE IDENTITY OF THE ATTACKERS IS UNKNOWN. THE REPORT WAS FILED BY FORMER CONGRESSMAN HUMBERTO BALZA, THE PRESIDENT OF THE PDC'S LOCAL CHAPTER, WHO HAS ALSO RECEIVED DEATH THREATS IN THE PAST FEW HOURS. THIS IS WHAT BALZA TOLD RADIO CHILENA'S "PRIMERA PLANA" FEATURE: UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS ATTACKED THE PDC'S PREMISES, LOCATED AT 683 SOTOMAYOR STREET, BREAKING THE WINDOWS OF THE PREMISES AND TRYING TO BREAK DOWN THE DOOR. LUCKILY, OUR GUARD WENT OUTSIDE TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND THE ATTACKERS TOOK OFF, LEAVING ABUNDANT YES-VOTE PROPAGANDA WITH THE PHOTOGRAPH OF THE CANDIDATE. THE ATTACKERS ALSO SHOUTED THREATS AGAINST THE MEMBERS OF THE PARTY'S BOARD. WE HAVE ALREADY TOLD THE ARICA PUBLIC, BUT NOW WE WANT ALL OF THE CHILEAN PUBLIC TO KNOW, THAT THE SUPPORTERS OF THE YES-VOTE ARE DESPERATE, BECAUSE THEY SEE THERE ARE NOW MORE NO-VOTE SUPPORTERS THAN YES-VOTE SUPPORTERS. THIS IS WHY THE LATTER ARE THREATENING PEOPLE, WHY THEY ARE TRYING TO STEAL IDENTITY CARDS, AND WHY THEY ARE RESORTIG TO ANY TYPE OF ACTION THAT WILL CREATE UNREST IN ORDER TO GIVE CONFIDENCE TO THE SUPPORTERS OF THE YES-VOTE AND TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE FOR ANY TYPE OF ACTION TO BE TAKEN ON 5 OCTOBER.

THE DIRCOTE HAS ALSO REPORTED THAT LEON TOOK PART IN TERRORIST ATTACKS WITH NESTOR SERPA CARTOLINI, ANOTHER TOP MRTA LEADER. ACCORDING TO INVESTIGATIONS, A SO-CALLED COMRADE LUCHO CONVINCED COMRADE JOSE TO JOIN THE MRTA IN JULY 1986. UNTIL MARCH 1987 LEON DISTRIBUTED LEAFLETS ON STREETS AND SQUARES, PAINTED SLOGANS ON THE WALLS OF PUBLIC BUILDINGS, AND DELIVERED FOOD--WHICH WAS STOLEN FROM WELL-KNOWN BUSINESS FIRMS--IN SHANTYTOWNS. IN MID-AUGUST 1987, LEON GOT INTO TOUCH WITH COMRADE MARIO, WITH WHOM HE TRAVELED TO THE VILLAGE OF TARAPOTO TO JOIN THE MRTA NORTHEASTERN COLUMN LED BY POLAY CAMPOS AND EMILIO SALAS SALDANA, AKA COMRADE MOISES, AMONG OTHERS.

TST4-MUC4-0028	SANTIAGO, 3 OCT 88 -- A TERRORIST ATTACK, IN WHICH CZECHOSLOVAK BOMBS WERE USED, HAS DESTROYED FOUR HIGH TENSION TOWERS IN THE CENTRAL REGION. THIS ATTACK HAS CUT THE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY TO A VAST REGION BETWEEN COPIAPO AND SANTIAGO. THE BLACKOUT OCCURRED ON SATURDAY NIGHT, 1 OCTOBER, AND LASTED FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF HOUR IN THE METROPOLITAN REGION. ACCORDING TO ENDESA , ONE OF THE TOWERS KNOCKED DOWN WAS LOCATED ON KM 24 OF THE MELIPILLA-RAPEL HIGHWAY.

ANOTHER TOWER DESTROYED BY THE TERRORISTS WAS TOWER NO 430 IN THE ITAHUA-ALTO JAHUEL SECTOR, WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE MAIN ELECTRICITY NETWORK. IN ADDITION TO THESE FOUR DESTROYED TOWERS, OTHER EXPLOSIONS WERE HEARD THAT SAME NIGHT IN SANTIAGO. THEY WERE CAUSED BY BOMBS PLANTED BY TERRORISTS WHO SEEK TO FRIGHTEN THE POPULATION. ACCORDING TO POLICE SOURCES, THE BOMBS USED TO CAUSE SO MUCH DAMAGE ARE POWERFUL CZECHOSLOVAK-MADE PLASTIC BOMBS, OF THE SAME TYPE THAT WERE FOUND AMONG THE CLANDESTINE ARSENALS SMUGGLED INTO THE COUNTRY BY THE MARXIST LEFTISTS AT CARRIZAL BAJO. THE TERRORISTS ALSO USED TNT IN THEIR BOMB ATTACKS.

TST4-MUC4-0031	BOGOTA, 7 OCT 88 -- AN EXPLOSION HAS DESTROYED A SECTION OF THE MULTIPURPOSE PIPELINE RUNNING FROM BARRANCABERMEJA TO BUCARAMANGA. THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED IN ALTO DE SAN PABLO WHILE GASOLINE AND PROPANE GAS WERE BEING PUMPED TO BUCARAMANGA. WE HAVE A REPORT NOW FROM TERESA RUEDA. COMMUNICATIONS TO AND FROM PUERTO PETROLERO AND BUCARAMANGA HAVE BEEN CUT OFF SINCE EARLY TODAY, AFTER AN ATTEMPT TO DYNAMITE THE MULTIPURPOSE PIPELINE DESTROYED A 100-METER SECTION OF THE CENTRAL HIGHWAY. THE SUPPLY OF GAS TO BUCARAMANGA WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THIS EVENT. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IT WILL TAKE AT LEAST 3 DAYS TO RESTORE NORMAL TRAFFIC, BECAUSE IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO USE DYNAMITE TO REMOVE ROCKS CURRENTLY BLOCKING THE HIGHWAY. THE ATTEMPTED SABOTAGE OCCURRED AT THE 65-KM MARK ON THE BUCARAMANGA - BARRANCABERMEJA HIGHWAY, 20 KM FROM THE PLACE WHERE A MILITARY CONVOY WAS AMBUSHED LAST WEDNESDAY. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THAT AN ATTEMPTED SABOTAGE OF THE BUCARAMANGA - BARRANCABERMEJA MULTIPURPOSE PIPELINE, WHICH CARRIES PROPANE GAS, GASOLINE, AND ACPM HAS TAKEN PLACE. THE EXPLOSION DESTROYED A 30-METER SECTION OF PIPELINE, AND SPARKED A FIRE THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN EXTINGUISHED. LOSSES CAUSED BY THE SABOTAGE, WHICH HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE ELN, HAVE YET TO BE ASCERTAINED. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT REPAIRS TO THE HIGHWAY ALONE WILL COST THE PUBLIC WORKS MINISTRY 5 MILLION PESOS. WELL, AFTER INITIAL TALKS WITH ECOPETROL TECHNICIANS TODAY, BEGINNING AT 1700, AFTER THE FIRE IS UNDER CONTROL, THEY WILL BEGIN RESTORING SERVICE ON THE OIL PIPELINE. AT THIS TIME, THERE IS TRAFFIC CONGESTION NEAR THE SUGAMOSO BRIDGE. WHILE STILL ON THE SUBJECT, ECOPETROL'S PRESIDENT, WHO TRAVELED THIS MORNING TO BARRANCABERMEJA TO ATTEND A FORUM ON THE MAGDALENA RIVER, REPORTED THAT, SO FAR THIS YEAR, TERRORIST ATTACKS HAVE COST HIS COMPANY $300 MILLION. WE HAVE THIS REPORT FROM MARIA CLARA GRACIA. ECOPETROL HAS LOST 95 BILLION PESOS IN REVENUES THIS YEAR DUE TO THE 44 TERRORIST ATTACKS ON THE CANO LIMON - COVENAS OIL PIPELINE. IN THESE ATTACKS, 13.2 MILLION BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL HAVE BEEN LOST. THE AREAS MOST AFFECTED BY THESE ATTACKS ARE IN SUCRE, ARAUCA, NORTE DE SANTANDER, AND SANTANDER DEPARTMENTS. DOCTOR, COULD THESE TERRORIST ATTACKS LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES IN COLOMBIA? OBVIOUSLY, THERE WILL COME A TIME WHEN, FACED WITH INCREASING INTERNAL PRODUCTION COSTS AND FALLING REVENUES, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CONSIDER COMPENSATING OUR LOSSES WITH AN INCREASE IN DOMESTIC OIL PRICES, BUT THAT IS A MEASURE WE ARE NOT ABOUT TO ADOPT AT THIS TIME. TODAY'S LANDSLIDE, WHICH DESTROYED A SECTION OF THE MULTIPURPOSE PIPELINE BETWEEN BARRANCABERMEJA AND BUCARAMANGA, HAS RESULTED IN ESTIMATED LOSSES TOTALLING 1.435 BILLION PESOS.

TST4-MUC4-0034	LIMA, 9 OCT 88 -- IT WAS DISCLOSED IN THIS CAPITAL TODAY THAT A BOMB EXPLODED AT THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOME OF A PERUVIAN ARMY GENERAL, CAUSING DAMAGES BUT NO CASUALTIES. THE BOMB WENT OFF 48 HOURS AFTER A MEMBER OF THE ARMY SUSTAINED A BULLET WOUND. THE TERRORIST ATTACK WAS PERPETRATED AT DAWN ON SATURDAY, 9 OCTOBER, BY A GROUP OF UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS WHO HURLED A BOMB AT THE HOME OF GENERAL ENRIQUE FRANCO, IN THE SAN BORJA NEIGHBORHOOD IN LIMA, FROM A PASSING VEHICLE.

THE BRITISH DISPATCHED TWO ROYAL AIRFORCE FIGHTER PLANES TO THE "GENERAL AREA AND ONCE THE BRITISH HARRIERS APPEARED AT THE SITE OF THE INCIDENT, THE BRITISH COMMUNICATED BY TELEPHONE WITH GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES," THE RADIO REPORTED. AGREEMENT WAS REACHED FOR THE GUATEMALAN VESSEL TO WITHDRAW FROM THE AREA. BRITISH AUTHORITIES HAVE TAKEN UP THE MATTER WITH GUATEMALA AND TRUST THAT GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES WILL TAKE MEASURES TO ENSURE "THAT AN UNFORTUNATE AND DANGEROUS INCIDENT" WHICH OCCURRED ON SUNDAY "WILL NOT RECUR," THE RADIO SAID. IN EARLY OCTOBER THE GUATEMALAN NAVAL PATROL IN THE SAME GENERAL AREA IN THE SOUTH OF BELIZE, SEIZED A HONDURAS REGISTERED BOAT ALONG WITH ITS HONDURAN CREW AND FIVE BELIZEANS INCLUDING FIVE FISHERMEN AND A MARINE BIOLOGIST WHO WERE CONDUCTING DEEP SEA FISHING RESEARCH IN THE AREA. THE BELIZEANS WERE LATER RELEASED AFTER THE BELIZE GOVERNMENT APPROACHED GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES. BELIZE PRIME MINISTER MANUAL ESQUIVEL LATER TOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE THAT THE HONDURAN VESSEL WAS IN GUATEMALAN WATERS WHEN IT WAS SEIZED. RELATIONS BETWEEN BELIZE AND GUATEMALA HAVE BEEN STRAINED BY THEIR TERRITORIAL DISPUTE. GUATEMALA CLAIMS A SECTION OF BELIZE--A CLAIM WHICH THE FORMER BRITISH COLONY REJECTED.

TST4-MUC4-0039	BOGOTA, 17 OCT 88 -- THE LEFTIST NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY KIDNAPPED TWO SOLDIERS IN NORTHERN COLOMBIA IN THE PAST FEW HOURS. THIS BRINGS TO 24 THE NUMBER OF MILITARY MEN HELD BY REBELS. ACCORDING TO 2D BRIGADE COMMANDER GENERAL JUAN SALCEDO LORA, THE SOLDIERS ARE ARTILLERY BATTALION MEMBERS AND WERE KIDNAPPED WHILE WORKING ON A HIGHWAY IN POPONTE, IN THE NORTHERN CESAR DEPARTMENT. MEANWHILE, AN OFFICER AND FOUR POLICEMEN ARE EXPECTED TO BE RELEASED IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS. THE FARC KIDNAPPED THESE MEN 6 WEEKS AGO WHEN THE REBELS ATTACKED MINCA IN THE SIERRA NEVADA DE SANTA MARTA AREA. AN OFFICIAL COMMITTEE, FORMED BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS FROM THE NATIONAL REHABILITATION PLAN AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND MEMBERS OF THE "DEMOCRATIC COEXISTENCE COMMISSION"--A MULTIPARTY ORGANIZATION THAT SEARCHES FOR POLITICAL SOLUTIONS TO COLOMBIA'S PROBLEMS--WAS CONTACTING THE REBELS TODAY TO WORK OUT THE FINAL DETAILS OF THE FIVE MILITARY MEN'S RELEASE. THE REMAINING 17 POLICEMEN--TAKEN BY THE REBELS DURING AN ATTACK ON NORTHERN SAN PABLO MUNICIPALITY ON 5 OCTOBER--ARE STILL HELD BY THE REBELS. TALKS FOR THEIR RELEASE HAVE NOT MOVED FORWARD BECAUSE THE ARMY REFUSES TO ACCEPT THIRD PARTIES AS MEDIATORS.
TST4-MUC4-0040	CLANDESTINE, 19 OCT 88 -- ATTENTION: THE MANUEL JOSE ARCE URBAN COMMAND HAS BRILLIANTLY SABOTAGED A COMMERCIAL BUILDING BELONGING TO THE BOURGEOISIE IN THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD, CAUSING HEAVY ECONOMIC LOSSES TO THE IDLE CLASS. AT LEAST 37 BUSINESSES WERE DESTROYED. THE SAME URBAN COMMAND CARRIED OUT OTHER SABOTAGE AT THE PARKING LOT--SPECIFICALLY, IN THE PINK ZONE, OR ACTUALLY IN WHAT SHOULD BE CALLED THE RED ZONE. OTHER SABOTAGE TOOK PLACE AT THE LANCER MOTEL NEAR APOPA. IN A COMMUNIQUE, THE MANUEL JOSE ARCE URBAN COMMAND STATES THAT ON 15 SEPTEMBER, A LENGTHY ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS TO CREATE A NEW POLITICAL-MILITARY GROUP--IN WHICH 25 DELEGATIONS REPRESENTING NEIGHBORHOOD COMMANDS PARTICIPATED--ENDED WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE MANUEL JOSE ARCE URBAN COMMAND. THE COMMUNIQUE WARNS THE ARMY HIGH COMMAND, ITS OFFICERS, CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC AND ARENA OFFICIALS, AND U.S. ADVISERS THAT THE MANUEL JOSE ARCE URBAN COMMAND IS A WEAPON THAT WILL BE USED AGAINST THEM WHEREVER THEY MAY BE--AT HOME, WORK, AND AT RECREATION AND CORRUPTION CENTERS. IN ADDITION, THEIR PROPERTY HAS BEEN DECLARED PERMAMENT MILITARY TARGETS UNTIL THEY STOP THE BLOODSHED AGAINST THE PEOPLE. IN THE PAST FEW HOURS, THE FMLN'S PEDRO PABLO CASTILLO URBAN COMMAND EXECUTED AN AIR FORCE OFFICER AS PART OF THE "MURDER THE CRIMINALS" OPERATION AGAINST REPRESSION, THE MASSACRE IN SAN VICENTE, AND THE PERSECUTION OF THE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY. THE EXECUTION OF AN AIR FORCE PILOT OFFICER WAS CARRIED OUT IN SAN SALVADOR'S LAS BRISAS NEIGHBORHOOD. WE CAN IMAGINE THE HAPPINESS OF OUR PEOPLE UPON HEARING THE NEWS THAT ONE OF THE CRIMINALS AMONG CRIMINALS--THAT IS, ONE OF THE PILOTS WHO HAVE BOMBED VILLAGES AND CANTONS THROUGHOUT OUR FATHERLAND--WAS KILLED AS A RESULT OF REVOLUTIONARY JUSTICE. FROM NOW ON, BOMBS WILL NOT ONLY EXPLODE IN THE VILLAGES OF CHALATENANGO, CABANAS, USULUTAN, MORAZAN, AND NORTHERN SAN MIGUEL; MORE POWERFUL BOMBS WILL NOW EXPLODE MORE FREQUENTLY IN THE ESCALON AND SAN BENITO NEIGHBORHOODS, THAT IS, IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE RICH, IN THEIR RECREATION CENTERS, MANSIONS, AND WHEREVER ELSE THEY MAY GO.
TST4-MUC4-0041	LIMA, 5 OCT 88 -- HUANCAYO -- TWO ARMY MEMBERS WERE KILLED AND TWO OTHERS WERE TAKEN HOSTAGE BY A GROUP OF TERRORISTS WHO THIS MORNING INTERCEPTED TWO BUSES ON THE MARGINAL HIGHWAY, 30 KM WEST OF SATIPO AND 280 KM NORTHEAST OF HUANCAYO.

THE VEHICLES WERE TRAVELING FROM SATIPO TO HUANCAYO. THE TERRORISTS MADE THE PASSENGERS GET OFF THE BUSES AND THEN EXAMINED THEIR IDENTIFICATION CARDS. FOUR OF THE PASSENGERS, WHO TURNED OUT TO BE ARMY MEMBERS DRESSED IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES, WERE SEPARATED FROM THE GROUP. TWO OF THOSE IDENTIFIED AS SOLDIERS WERE KILLED IMMEDIATELY, WHILE THE OTHER TWO, APPARENTLY ARMY OFFICERS, WERE TAKEN AS HOSTAGES TOWARD ATALAYA, IN A MONTAINOUS REGION.
TST4-MUC4-0042	BOGOTA, 24 OCT 88 -- ACCORDING TO MILITARY SOURCES, A BLOODY GUERRRILLA OFFENSIVE TODAY LEFT 35 GUERRILLAS AND 5 SOLDIERS DEAD, 6 CIVILIANS WOUNDED, AND 5 BRIDGES PARTIALLY DESTROYED. THE OUTBREAK OF THE VIOLENCE COINCIDED WITH THE REPLY FROM ALL THE REBEL GROUPS TO AN OFFICIAL PEACE PLAN AND WITH THE CONFIRMATION BY THE LABOR FEDERATIONS THAT THEY WILL HOLD A GENERAL STRIKE ON THURSDAY DESPITE GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO PREVENT IT. THE SO-CALLED NATIONAL GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD PROPOSED TO PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO THE HOLDING OF A SUMMIT BETWEEN THE REBEL LEADERS AND THE GOVERNMENT, DEFENSE, AND ENERGY AND MINES MINISTERS AT A PLACE AND DATE TO BE AGREED UPON. THE DOCUMENT PROPOSED THAT THE MEDIATOR OF THE DIALOGUE BE THE DEMOCRATIC COEXISTENCE COMMISSION , HEADED BY MSGR DARIO CASTRILLON, PRESIDENT OF THE LATIN AMERICAN BISHOPS CONFERENCE. THE DOCUMENT IS VIEWED AS THE CNG'S OFFICIAL REPLY TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PEACE PLAN. GUERRILLAS OF THE FARC AND THE POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY ATTACKED FOUR TOWNS IN NORTHERN COLOMBIA, LEAVING 17 GUERRILLAS AND 2 SOLDIERS DEAD AND 3 BRIDGES PARTIALLY DESTROYED. THE DEFENSE MINISTRY REPORTED THAT FARC GUERRILLAS AMBUSHED A MILITARY CONVOY IN HUILA DEPARTMENT, KILLING THREE SOLDIERS. IT ALSO REPORTED THAT THREE REBELS WERE KILLED IN CLASHES IN SOUTHERN COLOMBIA. IT ADDED THAT NINE GUERRILLAS OF THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION WERE KILLED IN CLASHES WITH TROOPS OF THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE ON THE BORDER OF ANTIOQUIA AND CHOCO DEPARTMENTS AND THAT SIX FARC REBELS WERE KILLED IN CAQUETA DEPARTMENT. SUSPECTED GUERRILLAS DYNAMITED AT DUSK A BRIDGE IN BOGOTA'S URBAN CENTER, INJURING SIX PEOPLE. THE BRIDGE DID NOT SUSTAIN MAJOR DAMAGE. ANOTHER BRIDGE WAS BLOWN UP IN SANTANDER DEPARTMENT. MILITARY SOURCES SAID THESE WERE REBEL ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE STRIKE AND THEY CHARGED THAT WORKERS, PEASANTS, AND BUS DRIVERS ARE BEING THREATENED TO FORCE THEM TO JOIN THE STRIKE. PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO HEADED A MEETING OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL TO ADOPT MEASURES TO PREVENT DISORDERS DURING THE PLANNED STRIKE AND TO GUARANTEE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION FOR THE PEOPLE. THE GOVERNMENT AND THE WORKERS YESTERDAY BROKE OFF THEIR TALKS AFTER BEING UNABLE TO REACH AGREEMENT ON AN INCREASE OF THE MINIMUM WAGE AND ON A FREEZE IN THE PRICES OF STAPLES. THE STRIKE, CALLED BY THE UNITED WORKERS CONFEDERATION AND THE GENERAL CONFEDERATION OF LABOR, WILL PROTEST THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT REPLIED TO LABOR DEMANDS THEY PRESENTED IN MAY.
TST4-MUC4-0043	SAN SALVADOR, 24 OCT 88 -- WE ARE FACING AN ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE CAUSED BY THE FMLN, WHICH SHOWS ITS MILITARY WEAKNESS MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. THE FMLN IS SUPPOSEDLY ATTACKING MILITARY TARGETS, BUT NEITHER A JAIL NOR A SHOPPING MALL IS A MILITARY TARGET. COMMERCIAL AREAS OR AMUSEMENT PLACES ARE NOT MILITARY TARGETS. CAR BOMBS WENT OFF IN SUCH PLACES LATELY. THEY WENT OFF AT A CHAIN OF AND AT A SHOPPING MALL. THE FMLN'S STRATEGY IS SIMPLY TO INCREASE ITS TERRORIST ACTIONS. FOR THAT REASON, IT IS REGRETTABLE THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DESCRIBES THE FMLN AS A GROUP IN ARMS, BECAUSE THEY ARE MERELY TERRORIST CRIMINALS. THERE IS POLITICAL WEAKNESS, BECAUSE THE ARMED FORCES ARE NOT GIVEN CLEAR MISSIONS. WE SEE THE ACTIONS OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THE SECURITY CORPS ARE FRUSTRATED, BECAUSE THEY SPEND TIME, EFFORT, AND MEN CAPTURING TERRORISTS WHILE THE GOVERNMENT SUBSEQUENTLY RELEASES THEM FOR HUMANITARIAN REASONS. I BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT MUST APPLY THE LAWS MORE FORCEFULLY AND STOP DECEIVING THE POPULATION WITH WORDS SUCH AS DEMOCRATIZATION AND WITH ITS GREAT POLITICAL DEMAGOGY. FINALLY, OCHOA PEREZ CRITICIZED THE MEETING COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS WILL HOLD WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND TODAY. HE SAID OSCAR ARIAS IS NOT THE RIGHT PERSON TO DEAL WITH SALVADORAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.
TST4-MUC4-0044	SANTIAGO, 16 OCT 88 -- THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT WILL DEVELOP A NEW FORM OF STRUGGLE CALLED THE "NATIONAL PATRIOTIC WAR," "WHICH WILL START AT ANY MOMENT." THIS INFORMATION WAS DISCLOSED YESTERDAY TO EL MERCURIO BY FPMR SPOKESMAN VICTOR DIAZ CARO, WHO SAID THAT THE TRUCE DURING THE PLEBISCITE WAS TO PREPARE THE PHASE THEY ARE NOW STARTING. HE ALSO CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT IN BRUSSELS THIS WEEK BY FPMR INTERNATIONAL SPOKESMAN MARCELO REYES. DIAZ CARO, WHO HAS CONFESSED TO BEING ONE OF THE SNIPERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE ATTACK ON PRESIDENT AUGUSTO PINOCHET, IS CURRENTLY UNDER ARREST IN THE SANTIAGO PRISON, AND, TOGETHER WITH VASILY CARILLO NOVA, HE IS NATIONAL SPOKESMAN FOR ONE OF THE FACTIONS OF THIS EXTREMIST ORGANIZATION. DIAZ CARO, WHO WAS ARRESTED IN LATE 1986 BY THE POLICE, ANNOUNCED THAT IN "A MATTER OF HOURS" THEY WILL START SUBVERSIVE ACTIONS. HE EXPLAINED THAT THIS NEW PHASE OF ARMED STRUGGLE WILL BE CARRIED OUT "FROM ARICA DOWN TO MAGALLANES." AT THE SAME TIME HE REFERRED TO THE RESULTS OF THE PLEBISCITE, STATING THAT ALTHOUGH THEY RESPECT THOSE WHO VOTED "NO," "THE ONLY ASPECT OF THE VICTORY OF THE `NO' WE ACCEPT IS THAT PINOCHET LEAVE POWER." IN REFERRING TO THE FPMR'S CHANGE OF STRATEGY, DIAZ CARO DISCLOSED THAT THE DECISION WAS MADE DURING A MEETING OF THE ORGANIZATION'S LEADERS LAST APRIL. OF THIS OCCASION THEY DISCUSSED THE LINE THAT THE TERRORIST ORGANIZATION SHOULD FOLLOW. THEY ALSO DECIDED TO GIVE UP THE IDEA OF AN "ARMED REBELLION," WHICH PREVAILED UNTIL THEN. THE MAIN CHARACTERISTIC OF THAT IDEA WAS THAT THE ORGANIZATION SERVED TO COMPLEMENT CLASS STRUGGLE , TO SUPPORT THE PEOPLE'S REBELLION TO PARALYZE THE COUNTRY AND TO PERPETRATE ATTACKS AGAINST THE ESTABLISHED REGIME. DIAZ CARO DISCLOSED THAT DURING THE MEETING THEY DECIDED TO REPLACE THE REBELLION WITH THE SEARCH FOR A PATRIOTIC UNITY GOVERNMENT. HE SAID THAT "WE REALIZE THAT OUSTING THE REGIME IS SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATIONS UNDER A PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT." ACCORDING TO DIAZ CARO THIS IS WHEN THEY REALIZED THE "NEED FOR A `TRUCE' BECAUSE THEY NEEDED TO PLAN GREATER STEPS." HE ADDED THAT "THIS IS WHEN WHAT WE CALL THE `NATIONAL PATRIOTIC WAR' SURFACED. THE MAIN ISSUE OF THIS WAR IS THE ARMED STRUGGLE; WE ARE NO LONGER A MERE COMPLEMENT TO THE PEOPLE. IT REPRESENTS A QUALITATIVE STEP FORWARD AND ENTAILS GREATER RESPONSIBILITIES." DIAZ CARO DISCLOSED THAT THIS NEW PHASE WILL REQUIRE A GREATER QUANTITY OF WEAPONS, MORE MEN, AND ALL THE SUPPORT NECESSARY TO OPERATE. HE SAID THAT THE MONTHS OF TRUCE WERE USED TO FULFILL THESE NEEDS. THE SPOKESMAN ADDED THAT DURING THE MEETING THEY ALSO DECIDED ON THE NEED TO ESTABLISH A NON-ISOLATED ACTION. "WE THOUGHT THAT ACTIONS IN SANTIAGO, CONCEPCION, AND VALPARAISO WOULD BE THE SOLUTION, BUT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE." DIAZ CARO EXPLAINED THAT "THIS IS WHY WE NOW REALIZE THAT THE STRUGGLE SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT FROM ARICA DOWN TO MAGALLANES, THROUGHOUT THE TERRITORY AND IN VARIOUS FORMS."
TST4-MUC4-0045	BOGOTA, 25 OCT 88 -- IN ANOTHER ACT OF VIOLENCE, 18 PEOPLE WERE KILLED NEAR CANASGORDAS IN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT. EPL GUERRILLAS BLEW UP A BRIDGE AS A PUBLIC BUS, IN WHICH SEVERAL POLICEMEN WERE TRAVELING, WAS CROSSING IT. THE ATTACK KILLED NINE POLICEMEN AND NINE CIVILIANS, INCLUDING FOUR EMPLOYEES OF THE CIVIL REGISTRY OFFICE, WHO HAD BEEN IN PEQUE ON SUNDAY FOR THE ELECTION OF A NEW MAYOR. THE BLOODY ATTACK OCCURRED IN JUNTAS DE URAMITA, WHERE THE INJURED ARE BEING TREATED.
TST4-MUC4-0046	SAN SALVADOR, 26 OCT 88 -- DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THE AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL REPORT, WHICH CLAIMS THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE INVOLVED IN THE MURDER OF CERTAIN SALVADORAN CITIZENS? I UNDERSTAND THAT AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL HAS TO PREPARE A REPORT EVERY YEAR, AND THE ORGANIZATION INCLUDES WHATEVER VIEWS IT CHOOSES IN THE REPORT. THE ORGANIZATION OBVIOUSLY STATES ITS VIEWS IN THE REPORT. SALVADORANS DO THINGS ACCORDING TO THE LAW. IF ANY SALVADORAN OR FOREIGNER HAS EVIDENCE , THEN IT SHOULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURTS. THAT IS THE LOGICAL AND LEGAL WAY FOR US TO BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION; THAT IS WHAT WE ALWAYS DO IN ALL SUCH CASES. MR PRESIDENT, YOUR GOVERNMENT HAS ISSUED A SPECIAL REPORT CLAIMING THAT SOME DEATH SQUAD MEMBERS HAVE DESERTED AND IMPLICATED SEVERAL RIGHT-WING MEMBERS IN THE MURDER OF MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO AND OTHER SALVADORANS. WE ARE ANALYZING THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE IN THOSE CASES. YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE CAREFULLY ANALYZED THE CASES. I RELEASED INFORMATION ONLY WHEN THE EVIDENCE WAS DULY INVESTIGATED AND CORROBORATED. WE ARE PROCESSING A SIZABLE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION, BUT I DO NOT WANT TO DISCUSS IT IN DETAIL BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD HINDER THE INVESTIGATION. IS IT TRUE THAT YOU HAVE TWO VIDEO RECORDINGS IN WHICH THE TWO DESERTERS GIVE THEIR NAMES AND DETAILS AND THAT THESE RECORDINGS ARE BEING ANALYZED BY MILITARY INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AND THE GOVERNMENT? WE ARE CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING THE CASE. THAT IS WHY I SAID THAT I WOULD NOT LIKE TO REVEAL ANY DETAILED INFORMATION--BECAUSE THIS MIGHT HINDER THE INVESTIGATION. MR PRESIDENT, THE AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL REPORT STATES THAT DEATH SQUADS--WHICH ARE REPORTEDLY COMPOSED OF SOLDIERS AND POLICEMEN--ARE BEING REACTIVATED AT A TIME WHEN THE ARMED FORCES OPPOSE YOUR POLICIES. I DO NOT THINK SO. MY GOVERNMENT'S POLICY REMAINS UNCHANGED. WE ADVOCATE THE DEFENSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY. I THINK THIS IS ALWAYS EVIDENT. EVERY DAY THIS IS DEMONSTRATED BY EVENTS. FILM ABOUT GUERRILLA COMMANDERS, WHICH REPRESENTS SUPPORT FOR THE FMLN AND DISTORTS THE PEOPLE'S VIEWS. NEVERTHELESS, WE KNOW THAT FREEDOM OF THE PRESS MUST PREVAIL AND THEREFORE WE DO NOT INTERVENE. YOU WILL NOT FIND ANOTHER COUNTRY THAT DOES THIS, YET WE ARE DOING SO BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD DEFEND FREEDOM OF THE PRESS ABOVE ALL. HOW MUCH CREDENCE DO YOU GIVE THE AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL REPORT? THE REPORT IS VALID INSOFAR AS THE FACTS ARE ALL THERE. HOWEVER, I THE WAY IN WHICH THE FACTS ARE INTERPRETED. THE FACTS ARE INTERPRETED ACCORDING TO AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL'S OWN . WE ALSO RECEIVED REPORTS FROM RED CROSS INTERNATIONAL EACH CASE. EACH CASE IS INTERPRETED DIFFERENTLY. THE UNITED NATIONS HAS ITS OWN OPINION; THE OAS HAS ITS OWN OPINION. EACH ONE ISSUES A REPORT, AND WE USE THAT INFORMATION AS THE BASIS FOR OUR INVESTIGATIONS ON HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, WHICH IS THE MAIN ISSUE.
TST4-MUC4-0047	MANAGUA , 27 OCT 88 -- NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA TODAY RELEASED A PROVISIONAL REPORT ON THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY HURRICANE JOAN AND ANNOUNCED AN "IMMINENT CONTRA" ATTACK AGAINST NICARAGUA. ACCOMPANIED BY FIVE FSLN NATIONAL DIRECTORATE COMMANDERS--HUMBERTO ORTEGA, BAYARDO ARCE, VICTOR TIRADO, CARLOS NUNEZ, AND TOMAS BORGE--AND MEMBERS OF HIS CABINET, ORTEGA ADDRESSED MEMBERS OF THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS ACCREDITED IN NICARAGUA AND THE FOREIGN PRESS TO REQUEST MORE INTERNATIONAL AID FOR THE NICARAGUANS AFFECTED BY HURRICANE JOAN. ORTEGA ALSO ASKED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR ITS MEDIATION IN LIGHT OF A NEW ATTACK BY 3,000 "CONTRAS" WHO, ACCORDING TO ORTEGA, ARE AT THE HONDURAN BORDER READY TO LAUNCH AN ATTACK AGAINST HIS PEOPLE "IN THIS DIFFICULT TIME." "THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST DEMAND THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT FORGET ITS PLAN TO ATTACK NICARAGUA. THE CONTRAS HAVE BEEN EQUIPPED BY THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION AND ARE READY TO ATTACK AT ANY MOMENT," THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT ADDED. "WE KNOW THAT THE REBELS HAVE BEEN ORDERED TO HINDER THE RECONSTRUCTION WORK THAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP THE PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE HURRICANE. THEY HAVE ALSO BEEN ORDERED TO SABOTAGE THE COFFEE HARVEST ACTIVITIES. THE BIGGEST HELP THE YANKEE GOVERNMENT COULD GIVE THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE WOULD BE TO STOP THE ATTACK," THE PRESIDENT STRESSED. ORTEGA ANNOUNCED THAT WHILE HIS COUNTRY WAS BEING HIT BY HURRICANE JOAN, THE CONTRAS CARRIED OUT ATTACKS AND KILLED FIVE CIVILIANS. REGARDING THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE HURRICANE, ORTEGA SAID THAT THIS COMING WEEK, AN ECLA TEAM WILL ARRIVE IN MANAGUA TO MAKE "FINAL" EVALUATIONS ON THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY JOAN LAST WEEK. INTERNATIONAL AID "IS NECESSARY AND URGENT BECAUSE THE SITUATION IS CHAOTIC," ORTEGA ADDED, STRESSING THE ROLE PLAYED BY CUBA IN HELPING HIS PEOPLE. HE SAID THAT CUBA SENT 24 PLANES TO NICARAGUA WITH FOOD, MEDICINE, AND MEDICAL TEAMS; MEXICO SENT 2 PLANES; AND SPAIN, GREAT BRITAIN, PANAMA, AND BELGIUM EACH SENT ONE; FOR A TOTAL OF 2,052 TONS OF AID. GIVING A PROVISIONAL REPORT ON THE DAMAGE, ORTEGA SAID THERE WERE 116 DEAD, 178 INJURED, 110 MISSING, AND 29,152 HOUSES DESTROYED AS WELL AS DAMAGE TO AGRICULTURE AND FISHING. HE STRESSED THE DAMAGE TO THE ECOLOGY BECAUSE THOUSANDS OF HECTARES OF FOREST WERE DESTROYED. HE SAID THAT EUROPEAN TECHNICIANS WILL TRAVEL TO NICARAGUA NEXT WEEK TO EVALUATE THE DAMAGE. ORTEGA SAID THAT TO FACE THE HURRICANE, THE COUNTRY USED THE DEFENSE SYSTEM IT WOULD USE TO REPEL A MILITARY ATTACK AND THAT THANKS TO THIS, MANY HUMAN LIVES WERE SAVED.
TST4-MUC4-0048	BOGOTA, 29 OCT 88 -- THE SECOND MEETING OF THE SO-CALLED GROUP OF EIGHT CONCLUDED TODAY IN PUNTA DEL ESTE, URUGUAY. AFTER THE URUGUAY DECLARATION WAS SIGNED, THE PRESIDENTS HOSTED A NEWS CONFERENCE. COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO ANSWERED A URUGUAYAN JOURNALIST'S QUESTION ON THE CURRENT SITUATION IN OUR COUNTRY: THE SITUATION IN YOUR COUNTRY IS VERY SERIOUS. THOUSANDS ARE DEAD, PARAMILITARY DEATH SQUADS GO UNPUNISHED DESPITE THEIR MURDERS OF PATRIOTIC UNION MEMBERS AND POPULARLY ELECTED LEGISLATORS. MR PRESIDENT, HOW CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS SITUATION AND HOW CAN YOU RECONCILE THE SITUATION EXISTING IN YOUR COUNTRY WITH YOUR AFFIRMATION OF THE EXISTENCE OF DEMOCRACY? THANK YOU. I DO NOT BELIEVE YOUR QUESTION IS RELEVANT TO THE COMPOSITION AND PURPOSE OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT MEETING. THE QUESTION ARISES FROM A LACK OF INFORMATION. COLOMBIA IS A DEMOCRACY, SUPPORTED BY A PROFESSIONAL ARMED FORCES. THE SOLDIERS ARE COLOMBIANS WHO ARE COMPLYING WITH THE REQUIREMENT TO PERFORM MILITARY SERVICE. THEY ARE YOUTHS FROM ALL GROUPS, FROM THE RURAL AREAS, THE CITIES, AND FROM ALL POLITICAL PARTIES. THE OFFICERS ARE PROFESSIONALS, AND THEY DO NOT FOLLOW MILITARIST DOCTRINES. THE ARMED FORCES MEMBERS WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED--MAY I ADD ON AN INDIVIDUAL AND PERSONAL BASIS--IN ANY HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION, WILL BE ARRAIGNED BEFORE A MILITARY COURT, AND MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN EXPELLED. CIVIL COURTS HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED OF SOME OF THOSE CRIMES, AND SOME ARREST WARRANTS HAVE BEEN ISSUED. MILITARY JUSTICE AUTHORITIES ARE ALSO CONDUCTING LEGAL ACTIONS. DURING THE SAME NEWS CONFERENCE THIS MORNING, PRESIDENT BARCO NOTIFIED JOURNALISTS THAT LAST THURSDAY'S STRIKE HAD BEEN AN ATTEMPT BY ARMED REBEL GROUPS AGAINST DEMOCRACY. HE ALSO SAID THAT THE PRESS CENSORSHIP DECREE WAS NO LONGER VALID.
TST4-MUC4-0049	SAN SALVADOR, 11 NOV 88 -- PRESIDENT JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE CALLED ON THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL PARTIES THAT WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS TO PROTECT THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND THE REPUBLIC. DUARTE MADE THIS CALL DURING HIS SPEECH OPENING THE 13TH INTERNATIONAL FAIR OF EL SALVADOR, IN WHICH 25 COUNTRIES ARE PARTICIPATING. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A PEACE LOVER, AND THAT IS WHY IT GRIEVES ME TO SEE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE CURRENT SALVADORAN CONFLICT AND CRISIS. I, HOWEVER, BELIEVE THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS WILL BE STRENGTHENED. I BELIEVE THE MINDS OF MEN WILL BE TRANSFORMED POSITIVELY, AND IDEOLOGICAL STRUGGLES--EVEN THE MOST POLARIZED ONES--WILL BE DEFINITELY SOLVED BY THE CIVILIZED MEANS OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. I CALL ON ALL POLITICAL PARTIES TO STRENGTHEN THE CURRENT POLITICAL PROCESS AND PUT THE SACRED INTERESTS OF THE NATION BEFORE ANY OTHER INTERESTS BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO PROTECT THE REPUBLIC AND CONSOLIDATE THE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION THAT BELONGS TO ALL SALVADORANS. I ALSO WANT TO MAKE A CALL TO ALL GROUPS SO THE ELECTORAL PROCESS, WHICH WILL CULMINATE WITH THE ELECTION OF A NEW PRESIDENT NEXT YEAR, DEVELOPS WITH THE SPIRITUAL GRANDEUR THAT CORRESPONDS TO COURAGEOUS PEOPLE, WHO WISH TO SHOW THE WORLD THEIR POLITICAL MATURITY AND THEIR DESIRE TO LIVE IN PEACE. THE ELECTORAL PROCESS WILL SLOWLY CONSOLIDATE. I BELIEVE SOONER THAN LATER, GOOD JUDGEMENT WILL PREVAIL IN THE MINDS OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DRIVEN MAD BY BARBARISM. PRESIDENT DUARTE ALSO SAID THE FMLN WILL NOT STOP THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND THAT THE SALVADORAN SITUATION IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE PRESENTED BY FMLN COMMANDERS JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS AND LEONEL GONZALEZ DURING THEIR LATIN AMERICAN TOUR. IT IS TRUE THAT THE ENEMIES OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL GO ON CONDUCTING THEIR TERRORIST AND DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS. THOSE ACTIONS, HOWEVER, WILL NOT AT ALL AFFECT THE PROGRESS MADE BY OUR DEMOCRATIC STRUGGLE. THE TRUTH IS THAT OUR CRISIS IS AS LARGE AS THE EFFORT WE HAVE MADE TO FACE IT. THAT EFFORT GOES BEYOND OUR BORDERS AND REACHES THE ENTIRE WORLD. THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CHANGES THAT BEGAN TO TAKE PLACE IN EL SALVADOR ARE AND HAVE BEGAN TO SHOW THEIR RESULTS, DESPITE THE DESPERATE ACTIONS THE FMLN-FDR IS CONDUCTING ABROAD IN ORDER TO COUNTER THE RESULTS OF THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE. THE FOREIGNERS WHO CAME TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS FAIR AS WELL AS THE DISTINGUISHED OAS GENERAL ASSEMBLY DELEGATES WILL CONFIRM THAT THE SALVADORAN SITUATION IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT CIRCULATED ABROAD AND DISSEMINATED AS PART OF AN FMLN -FDR DISINFORMATION PLAN. THE REPRESENTATIVES OF OUR LOCAL SUBVERSIVE MOVEMENTS HAVE SAID ABROAD THAT THERE IS REPRESSION IN EL SALVADOR. ONLY A GOVERNMENT THAT IMPOSES ITSELF BY FORCE ON ITS PEOPLE CAN BE DESCRIBED AS A REPRESSIVE GOVERNMENT. OUR COUNTRY NEVER ENJOYED SO MUCH FREEDOM AS NOW AND ITS RULERS WERE NEVER CHOSEN SO FREELY AS THEY ARE NOW. PRESIDENT DUARTE SAID THE 18TH OAS REGULAR MEETING REPRESENTS THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES' SUPPORT FOR THE SALVADORAN DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.
TST4-MUC4-0050	BERLIN , 6 NOV 88 -- AT A NEWS CONFERENCE IN BERLIN ON FRIDAY , VOLODIA TEITELBOIM, MEMBER OF THE POLITICAL COMMISSION AND SECRETARIAT OF THE PCCH CENTRAL COMMITTEE, GAVE A REPORT ON THE SITUATION IN CHILE FOLLOWING THE REFERENDUM. HE SAID THAT THE PEOPLE'S RESOLUTE "NO" IN THE REFERENDUM ON 5 OCTOBER MUST NOW BE FOLLOWED BY THE OVERTHROW OF PINOCHET AND THE RETURN TO DEMOCRACY. THE FORMER SENATOR SAID THAT THE MOST URGENT CONDITION FOR THE PATH INTO THE FUTURE IS THE CREATION OF A BROAD UNITY OF ALL OPPOSITION FORCES WHICH CAN WIN A VICTORY OVER PINOCHET. HE SAID THAT THE COMMUNIST PARTY ALSO CONSIDERS COOPERATION, IN PARTICULAR WITH THE SOCIALISTS, A DECISIVE STEP. HE SAID THAT QUITE A FEW THINGS HAVE CHANGED IN CHILE THROUGH THE BROAD MASS MOVEMENT. HIGH OFFICERS WHO SERVED THE DICTATOR MOST LOYALLY HAVE HAD TO RESIGN NOW UNDER PRESSURE FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PUBLIC. IN ADDITION, IT HAS JUST BEEN REPORTED THAT EL SIGLO, THE COMMUNIST PARTY NEWSPAPER, WILL BE PUBLISHED AGAIN LEGALLY. ASKED ABOUT THE PRESENT CONDITIONS OF THE STRUGGLE, TEITELBOIM SAID THAT THE PROGRESSIVE FORCES IN CHILE, WHO HAD TO PAY A HIGH PRICE FOR THEIR RESISTANCE IN THE PINOCHET'S 15-YEAR RULE, CONTINUE TO BE EXPOSED TO PERSECUTION, IMPRISONMENT, AND THREATS OF MURDER. THE COMMUNIST PARTY, WHICH HAS HAD THE LARGEST NUMBER OF CASUALTIES AND MISSING AND TORTURED PEOPLE SINCE THE DICTATORSHIP WAS ESTABLISHED, CONTINUES TO BE BANNED. NONETHELESS, THE COUNTRY IS CAUGHT UP IN A WAVE OF MOBILIZATION OF THE PEOPLE. VOLODIA TEITELBOIM CONFIRMED THAT THE COMMUNIST PARTY SUPPORTS THE DEMAND MADE BY THE OPPOSITION ALLIANCE TO HOLD THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS PROMISED BY THE MILITARY JUNTA FOR LATE 1989 AT AN EARLIER DATE, AND TO NOMINATE A COMMON PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. IN ADDITION, THE CONSTITUTION--ON THE BASIS OF WHICH PINOCHET INTENDS TO CONTINUE IN OFFICE UNTIL MARCH 1990 DESPITE HIS DEFEAT THROUGH THE REFERENDUM--MUST BE ABOLISHED TO ALLOW THE PEOPLE TO DECIDE ON THE COUNTRY'S FUTURE IN FREEDOM. VOLODIA TEITELBOIM PAID TRIBUTE TO THE GDR'S CONSISTENT POSITION IN WORD AND DEED AS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY WITH THE CHILEAN PEOPLE. HE SAID THAT HUNDREDS OF PATRIOTS FROM HIS COUNTRY HAVE FOUND A TEMPORARY HOME IN THE GDR, WHERE THEY CAN LIVE AND WORK.
TST4-MUC4-0051	PISCO, 23 NOV 88 -- DEAR LISTENERS, WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU THAT AT APPROXIMATELY 0400 THIS MORNING, FOUR MASKED INDIVIDUALS STABBED PISCO DEPUTY PREFECT CARLOS SOTO SEDICE TO DEATH. THE CRIMINALS PERPETRATED THIS CONDEMNABLE MURDER ON THE SECOND FLOOR OF SOTO'S HOUSE AND THREW THE BODY DOWN THE STAIRS TO THE FIRST FLOOR. PISCO RESIDENTS, WHO ARE DEEPLY MOVED, HAVE STRONGLY CONDEMNED THIS HORRIBLE CRIME. SOTO IS THE SECOND OUTSTANDING APRA LEADER TO BE KILLED IN PISCO. ON 7 DECEMBER 1987, PROFESSOR CARLOS MEDRANO VAZQUEZ, WHO WON ELECTION BY A LANDSLIDE, WAS RIDDLED WITH BULLETS. THE BODY OF SOTO HAS BEEN TAKEN TO THE PISCO CENTRAL MORGUE.
TST4-MUC4-0052	SANTIAGO, 12 NOV 88 -- THE MOVEMENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY LEFT HAS DECIDED THAT IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS IT WILL CARRY OUT "A STRUGGLE OF THE MASSES" TO DESTABILIZE THE MILITARY REGIME BY "ALL FORMS OF STRUGGLE." THE MIR REJECTED THE STRATEGY OF DIALOGUE ADVOCATED BY THE OPPOSITION'S DEMOCRATIC SECTORS. THE MIR ADDED THAT IT WILL "TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY SITUATION" AND THAT IT WILL USE THE ELECTORAL PROCESS BY REGISTERING A LEFTIST PARTY. MIR SPOKESMAN JECAR NEGHME TALKED TO THE PRESS YESTERDAY ABOUT THE RESOLUTIONS APPROVED AT THE LATEST MIR CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON 6 AND 7 NOVEMBER. HE SAID THAT IT WAS THE FIRST MEETING HELD IN CHILE SINCE JULY 1973. NEGHME STATED THAT IN ADDITION TO POLITICAL ISSUES, THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE ALSO PAID HOMAGE TO RAUL PELLEGRIN AND CECILIA MAGNI, MEMBERS OF THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT WHO WERE KILLED RECENTLY. IN A PUBLIC COMMUNIQUE, THE MIR CRITICIZED THE OPPOSITION PARTIES FOR "NOT LISTENING TO THE NATIONAL CLAMOR FOR PINOCHET'S RESIGNATION" AND FOR GIVING PRIORITY TO "A STRATEGY OF SHADY DEALS AT THE TOP LEVEL." THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS: "ALTHOUGH THE DOCUMENT RELEASED BY THE 16 POLITICAL PARTIES FOCUSES ON SOME OF THE PEOPLE'S DEMANDS, ITS MAIN DEFECT IS THAT BY INCLUDING THE DEMANDS AS PART OF A NEGOTIATING STRATEGY AND BY MAKING THE MOBILIZATION TASKS UNCLEAR, THE DEMANDS OF THE CHILEAN PEOPLE WILL NOT BE HEARD." THE MIR ALSO SAID THAT NEXT YEAR IT WILL STRUGGLE FOR THE IMMEDIATE END OF THE REGIME AND THE CONSTITUTION, THE CREATION OF A PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT, THE ELECTION OF A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, THE STRENGTHENING OF THE UNITED LEFT, AND THE PREPARATION OF A "DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR PROGRAM" FOR THE COUNTRY. THE COMMUNIQUE SAYS THAT TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS THE MIR WILL PROMOTE A TACTIC "TO DESTABILIZE THE REGIME, TO MAKE THE INSTITUTIONS ILLEGITIMATE, TO DEMOCRATIZE THE COUNTRY, AND TO ACCUMULATE GREATER FORCE." THE COMMUNIQUE ALSO POINTS OUT THAT THE MIR WILL USE "THE LIMITED POSSIBILITY OF PARTICIPATING IN ELECTIONS BEGINNING IN 1988." THIS IS WHY THE MIR SUPPORTS THE REGISTRATION OF A LEFTIST PARTY: TO PREVENT THE EXCLUSION OF THE LEFT AND "TO PROMOTE THE GAINS OF THE PEOPLE."
TST4-MUC4-0053	QUITO, 27 NOV 88 -- GOVERNMENT MINISTER ANDRES VALLEJO YESTERDAY AGAIN DENIED THE CLAIM OF COMMANDERS JOAQUIN AND JAVIER OF THE ALFARO LIVES DAMMIT SUBVERSIVE GROUP THAT THEY HAVE MET WITH HIM. THE REBEL LEADERS MAINTAIN THEY HAVE MET ON FIVE OCCASIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT WITHIN A FRAMEWORK OF CONSULTATIONS AND COORDINATION PROPOSED BY PRESIDENT RODRIGO BORJA. ACCORDING TO THEM, ONE OF THE MEETINGS INVOLVED MINISTER VALLEJO HIMSELF, WHO REPORTEDLY INTRODUCED THEM TO A DELEGATE OF PRESIDENT BORJA FOR FURTHER TALKS. NEVERTHELESS, VALLEJO DID NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF HOLDING TALKS WITH THE GUERRILLAS TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN THE COUNTRY. FEBRES-CORDERO'S ADMINISTRATION REFUSED TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE ALFARO LIVES DAMMIT AND FREE HOMELAND MONTONERAS GUERRILLA GROUPS BECAUSE IT CONSIDERED THEM TO BE TERRORIST GROUPS; IT ACTUALLY ATTACKED THESE GROUPS TO THE POINT OF ALMOST ELIMINATING THEM. VALLEJO POINTED OUT THAT HOLDING TALKS WITH THE GUERRILLAS WOULD BE A POSITIVE STEP. HE RECALLED THAT THE COLOMBIAN ADMINISTRATION OF BELISARIO BETANCUR BEGAN A DIALOGUE WITH GENUINE REVOLUTIONARY ARMIES TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN THAT COUNTRY. HE ASKED: WHY CAN WE NOT HOLD TALKS HERE, WHERE THE GUERRILLAS ARE STILL AT AN EMBRYONIC PHASE? THE POSSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENT-GUERRILLAS TALKS HAS BEEN VIEWED DIFFERENTLY. NATIONAL CONGRESS PRESIDENT WILFRIDO LUCERO SAID ON 25 NOVEMBER THAT THE CONGRESS IS NEITHER TASKED NOR EMPOWERED TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE GUERRILLAS. LUCERO REFUSED TO COMMENT ON THE ALLEGED TALKS, SAYING THAT HE HAS RECEIVED NO INFORMATION IN THIS REGARD. HE ADDED: THESE KINDS OF PROBLEMS ARE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF OTHERS; IT IS NOT A CONCERN OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS. ACCORDING TO JULIO CESAR TRUJILLO, A FORMER PRESIDENT OF POPULAR DEMOCRACY, TALKS WITH GUERRILLAS WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY HAVE USEFUL IDEAS, SOME OF WHICH COULD BE IMPLEMENTED. HE ADDED THAT NOT EVERYTHING ADVOCATED BY THE GUERRILLAS CAN BE CARRIED OUT BECAUSE THERE ARE OBSTACLES FACING THE GOOD OFFICES OF THE CURRENT RULERS. MEANWHILE, THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PARTY OF FORMER PRESIDENT LEON FEBRES-CORDERO EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THIS POSSIBILITY. IT WILL MEET TOMORROW TO DISCUSS THE TOPIC AND ISSUE AN STATEMENT. MARCO LARA, PRESIDENT OF THAT PARTY AND PUBLIC INFORMATION SECRETARY DURING THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION, REFUSED TO COMMENT ON THIS. WHILE IN QUITO , COMMANDERS JOAQUIN AND JAVIER ARE PROPOSING A BROAD AND DIRECT DIALOGUE WITH RODRIGO BORJA'S REGIME; IN GUAYAQUIL, LEADERS JUAN CUBIA AND EDGAR PRIAS, BOTH IN PRISON, AND PATRICIO BAQUERIZO ARE REJECTING A DEMAND THAT THE MOVEMENT RESPECT THE LAW.
TST4-MUC4-0054	BOGOTA, 27 NOV 88 -- SIX GUERRILLAS OF A STILL UNIDENTIFIED GROUP DIED TODAY IN A SKIRMISH WITH ARMY TROOPS IN MORELIA, CAQUETA DEPARTMENT. MEANWHILE, IN CIUDAD BOLIVAR, ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, INSURGENTS APPARENTLY BELONGING TO THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY PLACED A BOMB IN THE CITY'S ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES AND ALSO DESTROYED FOUR FARMS, CAUSING APPROXIMATELY 100 MILLION PESOS IN DAMAGE.
TST4-MUC4-0055	LIMA, 28 NOV 88 -- MEMBERS OF THE BOMB SQUAD HAVE DEACTIVATED A POWERFUL BOMB PLANTED AT THE ANDRES AVELINO CACERES PARK, WHERE PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA WAS DUE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COMMEMORATION OF THE BATTLE OF TARAPACA.
TST4-MUC4-0056	BOGOTA, 28 NOV 88 -- IN VENEZUELA, AUTOPSIES HAVE BEEN PERFORMED ON 9 OF THE 14 FISHERMEN--INCLUDING 2 COLOMBIANS--KILLED IN EL AMPARO. THE AUTOPSY REPORTS ARE BEING WIDELY DISCUSSED. THE INVESTIGATIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT DIRECTLY INVOLVE THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES. COLOMBIAN FOREIGN MINISTER JULIO LONDONO PAREDES HAS REQUESTED COORDINATED ACTIONS BY THE TWO COUNTRIES TO PREVENT SUCH BORDER INCIDENTS. IT WAS ADMITTED THAT THE REMAINS OF THE FISHERMEN WERE EXHUMED OVER THE WEEKEND. SEVEN OF THEM WERE EXHUMED ON 26 NOVEMBER AND SIX ON 27 NOVEMBER IN VENEZUELA. THE JUDICIAL REPORT STATED THAT THERE WERE NO GUERRILLA CLASHES AND THAT EACH WAS KILLED BY A COUP DE GRACE OF THE VENEZUELAN ARMY. THE VENEZUELAN INVESTIGATIVE COMMISSION ENTRUSTED WITH CLARIFYING THE VENEZUELAN MILITARY AUTHORITIES' REASONS FOR SLAUGHTERING 14 FISHERMEN ON 22 OCTOBER IN EL AMPARO DIRECTLY INVOLVE THE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS. THE AUTOPSIES PERFORMED ON NINE BODIES HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT THE PEASANTS OF THE BORDER AREA DID NOT HAVE AN ARMED CLASH WITH THE MILITARY. ON THE CONTRARY, THEY WERE SHOT AT A DISTANCE LESS THAN 1 METER, WHICH IS WHAT THE TWO SURVIVORS SAID FROM THE BEGINNING. THOSE SURVIVORS HAVE NOW REQUESTED ASYLUM IN CARACAS FROM THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT. WE HOPE SUCH INCIDENTS WILL DECREASE AND THAT THE VENEZUELAN AUTHORITIES ALONG THE BORDER WILL COORDINATE WITH THE COLOMBIAN CIVILIAN AND MILITARY AUTHORITIES ANY ACTIONS FOR PRESERVING--NOT ONLY THE LIVES OF THE COLOMBIANS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE BORDER--PEACE AND TRANQUILLITY IN THE BORDER AREA. BECAUSE 2 OF THE 14 MURDERED FISHERMEN WERE COLOMBIANS, LONDONO PAREDES STATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL MAINTAIN ITS INITIAL STAND OF DEMANDING COMPENSATION FOR THE RELATIVES OF THE DEAD COLOMBIANS. THE GOVERNMENT WILL ALSO AWAIT AN OFFICIAL NOTIFICATION FROM VENEZUELA ON THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS ON THE EL AMPARO SLAUGHTER.
TST4-MUC4-0057	SAN SALVADOR, 28 NOV 88 -- COLONEL MAURICIO ERNESTO VARGAS, COMMANDER OF THE ARMY'S 3D BRIGADE IN SAN MIGUEL, HAS STATED THAT THE ARMED FORCES IS NOT INVOLVED IN DEATH SQUAD ACTIONS AND THAT SUCH ACTIONS ARE CONTRARY TO THE INSTITUTION'S REGULATIONS. VARGAS WAS REFERRING SPECIFICALLY TO THE MURDER OF THREE PEASANTS IN MORAZAN, OF WHICH THE ARMY IS BEING ACCUSED: OUR VALUES AND THE VALUES OF THE SYSTEM WE DEFEND DO NOT ALLOW US TO EXECUTE, KIDNAP, OR STEAL. THE SYSTEM STATES WE ARE TO COMPLY WITH OUR LAWS AND LET THE RESPONSIBLE INSTITUTIONS DETERMINE GUILT OR INNOCENCE. WE CANNOT BE JUDGE AND JURY IN SUCH SITUATIONS. THE MOST RECENT CASE FOR WHICH THE ARMY IS BEING BLAMED IS THE MURDER OF THREE PEASANTS IN YAMABAL CANTON, MORAZAN, ON 12 NOVEMBER. VARGAS DENIED ARMED FORCES COMPLICITY IN THESE MURDERS AND STATED THAT HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS MUST INVESTIGATE IN CASES OF THIS NATURE SO THEY CAN PRESENT EVIDENCE AND ACCUSE A SPECIFIC SECTOR. HE ADDED THAT HE HAS EVIDENCE THE ARMY WAS NOT PRESENT IN YAMABAL CANTON ON THE DAY OF THE TRIPLE MURDER: I DIRECTLY ACCUSE THE FMLN AND TELL THE HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ACCUSING THE ARMED FORCES TO INVESTIGATE THE FMLN. THE HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS MUST NOT ACCEPT DIALECTIC CONCLUSIONS SUCH AS THE ONES MADE BY THE CRIMINAL JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, WHO SAID WE EXECUTED AND . THEY ARE NOT GOD. THEY TALK AS IF THE WORLD BELONGED TO THEM. THERE ARE LAWS AND A LEGAL FRAMEWORK IN THIS COUNTRY. OUR SYSTEM HAS A LEGAL FRAMEWORK, AND WE HAVE TO BASE OURSELVES ON IT. THERE ARE HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BECOME CORRUPT AND HAVE BECOME ACCOMPLICES OF THE FMLN'S MURDER; THEY REMAIN SILENT AND DO NOT DEFEND JUSTICE, LAWS, AND PRINCIPLES. REGARDING THIS CASE, I ACCUSE THE FMLN OF THESE DEATHS. WE HAVE EVIDENCE THE FMLN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTS PRESENTLY BEING REPORTED IN THE NORTHWESTERN ZONE. COL VARGAS ALSO CRITICIZED THE WORK DONE BY SOME HUMANITARIAN ORGNIZATIONS AND SAID THEY USE HUMAN RIGHTS AS AN EXCUSE TO PROTECT SECTORS THAT SHARE THEIR IDEOLOGY.
TST4-MUC4-0058	LIMA, 31 OCT 88 -- TWENTY-SIX PEOPLE, FOUR OF WHOM ARE POLICEMEN, WERE INJURED IN A BOMB EXPLOSION THAT OCCURRED BEFORE DAWN ON 30 OCTOBER. THE BOMB WAS PLACED IN A DANCE HALL IN AYACUCHO, A CITY LOCATED SOUTH OF LIMA. THE LOCAL PRESS TODAY REPORTED THAT THE POLICE HAVE ATTRIBUTED THE ATTACK TO TERRORISTS WHO USED A HOME-MADE BOMB CALLED "RUSSIAN CHEESE." THIS BOMB IS MADE UP OF POWDER, TACKS, PIECES OF IRON, AND STEEL WIRE. IT EXPLODES WHEN IT TOUCHES THE FLOOR. AYACUCHO WAS THE SITE OF A SIMILAR EXPLOSION ON 3 JULY WHEN SEVERAL UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE HURLED EXPLOSIVES AT A DANCE HALL WHERE THE MUSIC GROUP "LOS SHAPIS" WAS PLAYING. THE "LOS SHAPIS" MUSIC GROUP HAS RECEIVED DEATH THREATS FROM THE "SHINING PATH" GUERRILLA GROUP BECAUSE THE LATTER BELIEVES "LOS SHAPIS" PLAY ALIENATING MUSIC. ACCORDING TO POLICE SOURCES, THE "SHINING PATH," WHICH BEGAN ITS ACTIVITIES IN AYACUCHO IN MAY 1980, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF ABOUT 12,000 PEOPLE AND MATERIAL LOSSES ESTIMATED AT $10 BILLION.
TST4-MUC4-0059	BOGOTA, 31 OCT 88 -- BARRANQUILLA -- A 45 PERCENT CUT IN AVAILABLE ELECTRIC POWER IS CURRENTLY IN EFFECT ALONG THE ENTIRE COLOMBIAN ATLANTIC COAST. TODAY IS THE 5TH DAY OF THE ENERGY CRISIS IN THE ATLANTIC REGION, WHICH WAS CAUSED BY THE DESTRUCTION OF SEVEN POWER TOWERS OF THE NATIONAL ENERGY NETWORK. ONLY FOUR CORELCA UNITS ARE WORKING AND GENERATING 440 MEGAWATTS, WHILE OTHER CORELCA UNITS ARE FACING MANY OPERATIONAL PROBLEMS DUE TO A LACK OF GAS. THE ATLANTIC HYDROELECTRIC PLANT IS GENERATING APPROXIMATELY 70 MEGAWATTS. ATLANTIC HYDROELECTRIC PLANT DIRECTOR EDUARDO VELAR DE LA ROSA ESTIMATED THAT THE ELECTRICITY RATIONING WILL CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER 5 DAYS UNTIL THE POWER TOWERS BLOWN UP BY TERRORISTS ARE REPAIRED.
TST4-MUC4-0060	LIMA, 28 OCT 88 -- EEC AND ANDEAN GROUP OFFICIALS HAVE HELD MEETINGS AT THE CARTAGENA AGREEMENT BOARD HEADQUARTERS TO PROGRAM ACTIVITIES AIMED AT INCREASING TRADE TIES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. ACCORDING TO WHAT THE CARTAGENA AGREEMENT BOARD, A TECHNICAL-COMMUNITY INTEGRATION ORGANIZATION, REPORTED TODAY, THE POLITICAL AGREEMENTS THAT WERE ADOPTED BY THE ANDEAN-EUROPEAN JOINT COMMISSION IN THE MEETINGS HELD IN BRUSSELS IN APRIL ARE NOW BEING IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE HOLDING OF THESE TALKS. THE FIRST MEETING IN LIMA WILL BE TO DISCUSS FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES SUCH AS THE BETTER USE OF THE GENERALIZED PREFERENTIAL RATES SYSTEM THAT IS IMPLEMENTED BY THE EEC, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ACTIVITIES TO PROMOTE TRADE, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANDEAN EXPORTS. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE AGREEMENTS NOT ONLY ENCOMPASS THE STRENGTHENING OF TRADE TIES, BUT ALSO INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC COOPERATION FOR DEVELOPMENT. PETER HEISLER, THE CHIEF OF THE EEC DELEGATION, SAID THAT THIS MEETING SHOWS "OUR WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE." ACCORDING TO STATISTICS PROVIDED BY THE CARTAGENA AGREEMENT BOARD, IN 1986 THE ANDEAN GROUP, COMPRISED OF BOLIVIA, ECUADOR, COLOMBIA, PERU, AND VENEZUELA, RECORDED A DEFICIT OF $266 MILLION IN ITS TRADE WITH EEC COUNTRIES. THIS DEFICIT IN ANDEAN TRADE, WHICH HAS NOT BEEN RECORDED SINCE 1982, WHEN THE FOREIGN DEBT CRISIS EXPLODED IN ANDEAN GROUP COUNTRIES, IS CAUSED BY THE FALL BY ALMOST 23 PERCENT OF ANDEAN EXPORTS, WHICH IN 1988 TOTALED $3.847 BILLION. THIS DEFICIT IS ALSO CAUSED BY AN INCREASE OF 18 PERCENT IN ANDEAN IMPORTS FROM EEC COUNTRIES, WORTH $4.113 BILLION. BETWEEN 1970 AND 1986, THE ANDEAN GROUP ACCUMULATED A TRADE DEFICIT OF $2.175 BILLION WITH THE GROUP OF 12. DURING THIS PERIOD, ANDEAN EXPORTS TOTALED $54.795 BILLION, WHILE IMPORTS TOTALED $56.970 BILLION. THE COOPERATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CARTAGENA AGREEMENT BOARD MEMBERS AND EEC COUNTRIES WAS SIGNED ON 17 DECEMBER 1983 IN CARTAGENA, COLOMBIA. LATER, THE CONGRESSES OF ALL THE COUNTRIES COMPRISING THE ANDEAN GROUP APPROVED THE AGREEMENT WHILE NEGOTIATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THEM, PARTICULARLY REGARDING TRADE, HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE SINCE APRIL 1988.
TST4-MUC4-0061	SAN SALVADOR, 2 NOV 88 -- AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND FOUR WERE WOUNDED EARLY THIS MORNING DURING AN FMLN ATTACK ON THE EL ANGEL SUGAR MILL LOCATED NEAR APOPA. THE GUERRILLA ACTION BEGAN AT APPROXIMATELY MIDNIGHT WHEN ABOUT 50 GUERRILLAS ARMED WITH RIFLES AND MORTARS ATTACKED THE SUGAR MILL, WHICH IS LOCATED 15 KM NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR. DURING THE ATTACK, THE GUERRILLAS PARTIALLY DESTROYED THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES OF THE SUGAR MILL AND A NEARBY HOUSE. THE SUGAR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT AND MACHINERY WERE NOT DAMAGED. AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR, THE INSURGENTS WITHDREW. THE NUMBER OF FMLN CASUALTIES IS UNKNOWN. AT THE SAME TIME THAT THIS ATTACK WAS TAKING PLACE, THE FMLN STAGED HARASSMENT ATTACKS ON 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE UNITS GUARDING THE LAS CANAS BRIDGE, WHICH IS LOCATED ON THE ROAD FROM APOPA TO QUEZALTEPEQUE. IT HAS BEEN UNOFFICIALLY REPORTED THAT THE ARMY SUFFERED TWO DEAD AND TWO WOUNDED IN THIS ATTACK, BUT THIS REPORT WAS DENIED BY THE ARMED FORCES. THE TWO ACTIONS ARE PART OF A NEW FMLN MILITARY MANEUVER THAT BEGAN YESTERDAY WITH THE ATTACK ON THE NATIONAL GUARD HEADQUARTERS, WHERE 4 GUARDSMEN WERE KILLED AND 30 WOUNDED.
TST4-MUC4-0062	SANTIAGO, 28 OCT 88 -- A SHOOTOUT HAS BEEN REPORTED BETWEEN A GROUP OF GUERRILLAS AND JOINT ANTITERRORIST FORCES IN A MOUNTAINOUS REGION NEAR SAN FERNANDO. IT WAS UNOFFICIALLY REPORTED THAT THE TERRORISTS MIGHT BELONG TO THE GROUP THAT ATTACKED THE LOS QUENES POLICE STATION, WHICH WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED AND RESULTED IN THE KILLING OF A CARABINERO. IT WAS SAID THAT THE SHOOTOUT OCCURRED LAST WEDNESDAY AND THAT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CASUALTIES ON BOTH SIDES. NO OFFICIAL REPORT, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN RELEASED BECAUSE THIS INCIDENT IS BEING KEPT IN STRICT SECRECY. IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT THE SHOOTOUT MIGHT HAVE LASTED 2 HOURS IN THE EL MELADO AREA, A MOUNTAINOUS REGION NEAR THE CITY OF SAN FERNANDO. THE TERRORIST ATTACK TOOK PLACE NEAR CURICO.
TST4-MUC4-0063	SAN SALVADOR, 1 NOV 88 -- THE ARMED FORCES HAVE REPORTED THAT TWO SOLDIERS AND ONE GUERRILLA WERE KILLED YESTERDAY IN FIGHTING IN SAN MIGUEL AND MORAZAN DEPARTMENTS. THEY ALSO REPORTED THAT THE ANTEL OFFICE, COURT OFFICES, AND COMMUNITY CENTER OF DULCE NOMBRE DE MARIA WERE DYNAMITED BY THE FMLN EARLY THIS MORNING. ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS, A LARGE GROUP OF REBELS ENTERED THE TOWN AND, AFTER SUBDUING THE MILITARY GUARDS, THEY DYNAMITED THE BUILDINGS. NO CASUALTIES WERE REPORTED.
TST4-MUC4-0064	SAN SALVADOR, 4 NOV 88 -- I HAVE BEEN WORKING JOINTLY WITH THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF--NOT JUST THIS WEEK BUT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. I HAVE TO ADD THAT NOT ONLY THE NATIONAL POLICE ARE INVOLVED, BUT THE PUBLIC SECURITY FORCES AND THE MILITARY CORPS STATIONED HERE IN SAN SALVADOR. WE HAVE REINFORCEMENTS FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE AND ARE WORKING ON A JOINT PLAN TO HELP MINIMIZE TERRORIST ATTACKS THAT THEY WILL TRY TO CARRY OUT AND ARE CARRYING OUT AT THIS VERY MOMENT. JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE, RIGHT NOW WE ARE WAITING FOR A DEMONSTRATION THAT IS TO BEGIN AT THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY. THERE WILL BE STUDENTS TOGETHER WITH UNTS MEMBERS, WHO ARE GOING TO MARCH THEIR USUAL ROUTE AND END UP AT THE PARK ACROSS FROM THE CATHEDRAL. I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY PROBLEMS AS LONG AS THEY OBEY THE LAW. AS I SAID A FEW DAYS AGO, WE DO NOT WANT CONFRONTATIONS WITH ANYONE. WHAT THEY WANT IS TO CONFRONT POLICE AND PUBLIC SECURITY FORCES FOR THE SAKE OF CREATING A MARTYR, AND WE ARE UNWILLING TO OBLIGE THEM IN THIS ENDEAVOR. THE ATTACK AGAINST THE NATIONAL GUARD SEEMS LIKE A CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE SECURITY CORPS. WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THE NATIONAL POLICE ARE ON ALERT FOR AN ATTACK IN VIEW OF THE ATTACKS AGAINST THE NATIONAL GUARD AND THE TREASURY POLICE? AS I SAID BEFORE, THIS IS NOT NEW FOR US, AND WE ARE MAKING PLANS. YOU NOTICE THAT THE GENERAL HEADQUARTERS IS CLOSE TO HOMES. WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN IN USULUTAN AND IN SAN FRANCISCO MORAZAN WHERE THESE PEOPLE ATTACKED WITHOUT CARING WHETHER THEY DESTROYED PRIVATE PROPERTY OR HOMES--EVEN KILLING INNOCENT CIVILIANS. WE ARE NOT EXEMPT FROM THIS HERE. WE HAVE A STRATEGY. WE EVEN BELIEVE THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF AN ATTACK FROM INSIDE THE GENERAL HEADQUARTERS--IT IS VERY POSSIBLE, THEY HAVE DONE IT BEFORE. I REMEMBER WHEN THEY BOMBED THE SERVICE STATION HERE, DESTROYING THREE OR FOUR VEHICLES, AND THEY ALSO PLACED BOMBS INSIDE THE GENERAL DIRECTORATE OFFICE. WE ARE DOING ALL WE CAN TO TRY TO AVOID THESE PROBLEMS. WE ARE READY TO FACE ANY SITUATION. WHAT PLANS HAVE YOU MADE FOR THE UPCOMING OAS GENERAL MEETING, AND WHAT SECURITY RESPONSIBILITIES WILL THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE IN REGARD TO THIS MEETING? YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THESE ARE MAINLY MILITARY PLANS WHICH WE CANNOT VERY WELL DISCLOSE IN ADVANCE. IF I STARTED GIVING OUT THIS INFORMATION, I WOULD BE EXPOSING OUR SECURITY OPERATION FOR THE MEETING. ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT WE ARE TAKING THIS SITUATION VERY SERIOUSLY. WE HAVE REINFORCEMENTS FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE. NOT ONLY IS THE NATIONAL POLICE INVOLVED, BUT THE PUBLIC SECURITY CORPS, AS WELL AS OTHER UNITS THAT HAVE COME FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE TO SUPPORT THIS COMMON EFFORT.
TST4-MUC4-0065	TEMUCO, 4 NOV 88 -- THE FIVE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE DETAINED IN THE MOUNTAINOUS REGION OF COCOAN AND ARE ACCUSED OF BELONGING TO THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT TERRORIST ORGANIZATION ARE BEING HELD INCOMMUNICADO AT THE SOCIAL REHABILITATION CENTER. THE MILITARY PROSECUTOR OF CAUTIN, RODOLFO CALSEN, HAS 5 DAYS, BEGINNING TODAY, TO BRING CHARGES AGAINST THEM, AND TO EITHER CONDEMN OR RELEASE THEM FOR LACK OF EVIDENCE. THE DETAINEES, AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS MAXIMILIANO RIVERA, 31; ALDO ESTEBAN MUTARELO, 30; AND A WOMAN IDENTIFIED AS ANGELICA HUERTA HUERTA, 26. THEY WERE ALL DETAINED IN THE CATRIPULLI SECTOR, SOME 30 KM FROM PUCON, TOWARD THE MOUNTAINS. TWO M-16 RIFLES WERE FOUND ON THESE INDIVIDUALS, ALONG WITH AMMUNITION, EXPLOSIVES, AND SUBVERSIVE MATERIAL. TWO OTHER PEOPLE WERE LATER ARRESTED. THEY WERE IDENTIFIED AS ADOLFO MAS STILMAN FLORES, 29, AND ARNALDO RIVERA. NO WEAPONS WERE FOUND ON THEM. THESE DETAINTIONS WERE CARRIED OUT LAST MONDAY, 31 OCTOBER, BUT THE REPORT WAS RELEASED TO THE COMMUNICATIONS MEDIA ONLY YESTERDAY AFTERNOON . THE DETAINEES ARE REPORTEDLY BEING HELD INCOMMUNICADO WHILE AWAITING A RESOLUTION. IF THE DEADLINE IS NOT EXTENDED, WE WILL HAVE SOME NEWS TOMORROW ON WHETHER THEY WILL BE SUBMITTED TO TRIAL OR BE ACQUITTED FOR LACK OF EVIDENCE.
TST4-MUC4-0066	BOGOTA, 5 NOV 88 -- LUZ LEON, PATRIOTIC UNION COUNCILWOMAN FOR META DEPARTMENT, WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED TODAY DURING AN ATTACK IN VILLAVICENCIO IN WHICH HER HUSBAND, PARMENIDES CUENCA, WAS KILLED. THE MURDERERS HAVE NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED.
TST4-MUC4-0067	SANTIAGO, 7 NOV 88 -- CARABINEROS HAVE FOUND FOUR PACKETS CONTAINING EXPLOSIVES AT THE FOOT OF HIGH TENSION ELECTRIC TOWER NO 657 OF THE COLBUN-MACHICURA LINE. THE PACKETS WERE FOUND IN PLOT NO 5, EL ROMERAL SECTOR, 2 KM WEST OF SOUTHERN HIGHWAY NO 5. THE LAND BELONGS TO RAMON URRUTIA BLANCO. EACH PACKET CONTAINED 2 KG OF AMONIUM GELIGNITE, DETONATORS, FUSES, AND TIMING DEVICES. SPECIALIZED PERSONNEL BELIEVE THAT THE BOMBS WERE PLANTED A FEW DAYS AGO SO THAT THEY COULD BE ACTIVATED AT ANY TIME.
TST4-MUC4-0068	MEDELLIN, 6 NOV 88 -- THE LOCAL POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY GUERRILLAS TODAY KIDNAPPED THE ANTIOQUIA COLOMBIAN CIVIL DEFENSE COMMANDER. THE POLICE SAID MAJOR GUILLERMO RODRIGUEZ VELASQUEZ, RETIRED, WAS INTERCEPTED BY AN ELN COMMANDO WHILE TRAVELING FROM DORADAL TO MEDELLIN WITH SERGEANT MIGUEL ANTONIO AVILA BARRETO, ALSO RETIRED, WHO IS THE DEPARTMENT'S DCC RECRUITER. THE TWO DCC OFFICIALS WERE RETURNING TO MEDELLIN WHEN THEY WERE KIDNAPPED 1 KM FROM DORADAL.
TST4-MUC4-0069	SAN SALVADOR, 9 NOV 88 -- DEAR LISTENERS, THE MINISTER HAS ARRIVED AND WE WELCOME HIM AND THANK HIM FOR HIS PARTICIPATION IN THIS SEGMENT. GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING. VIOLENCE HAS INCREASED RECENTLY AND THE PEOPLE ARE EXTREMELY WORRIED. WHAT ARE THE ARMED FORCES DOING TO GUARANTEE THE PEOPLE'S WELFARE? THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S CONCERN ABOUT INCREASED TERRORIST VIOLENCE IS UNDERSTANDABLE. WE MUST BEAR IN MIND THAT TERRORIST ACTS ALWAYS ESCALATE WHEN IMPORTANT EVENTS ARE EXPECTED. THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN ONLY IN OUR COUNTRY; WE RECENTLY SAW IT IN SEOUL, BEFORE THE OLYMPICS, WHEN GROUPS RESORTED TO VIOLENCE TO PROVOKE THE AUTHORITIES AND PREVENT AN INTERNATIONAL EVENT FROM TAKING PLACE. AN OAS MEETING IS SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE IN THIS COUNTRY IN A FEW DAYS. THE EVENT IS BEING THREATENED BY A NUMBER OF ACTS, PARTICULARLY TERRORIST ACTS IN THE SAN BENITO, MAX DIAZ, ESCALON, AND SAN FRANCISCO NEIGHBORHOODS. THE TERRORISTS BELIEVE THE PEOPLE WILL PROTEST AGAINST THE OAS MEETING IF THEY CAUSE TERROR IN THOSE AREAS. WE ARE EXPECTING FOREIGN MINISTERS FROM LATIN AMERICA, CENTRAL AMERICA, AND THE UNITED STATES, WHOM THE TERRORISTS BELIEVE WILL CALL OFF THE MEETING BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY. THAT IS THE MAIN REASON FOR THE INCREASED VIOLENCE. YOU HAVE SEEN THAT WE HAVE INCREASED PATROL OPERATIONS RECENTLY. PATROLS ARE ALSO BEING CARRIED OUT AROUND THE VOLCANOES NEAR SAN SALVADOR. SECURITY MEASURES ARE ALSO BEING IMPLEMENTED ON THE PERIPHERY OF SAN SALVADOR AND AROUND THE MEETING VENUE, BUT I CANNOT GIVE YOU THE DETAILS. THERE IS ALSO A COMPLETE SECURITY PLAN FOR THE OFFICIALS WHO WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE OAS MEETING. WE ARE READY TO REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF AN INCIDENT TO A MINIMUM. HOWEVER, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HONEST AND I MUST ADMIT THERE IS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY OF SABOTAGE OR A TERRORIST ACT. THIS DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT IT WILL AFFECT THE SECURITY MEASURES IN THE AREA OF THE MEETING. FOR EXAMPLE, A BLACKOUT CAN BE CAUSED BY CUTTING OFF AN ELECTRIC LINE IN A DISTANT AREA. GENERAL, THE FMLN'S ATTACKS HAVE NOT BEEN SO OVERWHELMING IN THE PAST, YET NOW THOSE ATTACKS ARE ATTAINING CONSIDERABLE MILITARY SUCCESS. DO THE FMLN'S MILITARY ACTIONS MEAN IT IS SUPERIOR TO THE ARMED FORCES? WE CANNOT CONCEIVE THEIR MILITARY SUPERIORITY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. I HAVE NOTICED THE GUERRILLA LEADERS ARE CURRENTLY VISITING DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY THE CONTADORA GROUP MEMBERS. THEY ARE TRYING TO GAIN SUPPORT FOR READING A STATEMENT AT THE OAS MEETING, AND THEY ARE ALSO TRYING TO PRESSURE THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT INTO NEGOTIATING WITH THEM. THIS PROVES THE REBELS HAVE FAILED MILITARILY, AND THAT FAILURE HAS BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY OUR LARGE-SCALE OPERATIONS IN NORTHERN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT AND USULUTAN DEPARTMENT, IN THE EAST OF THE COUNTRY. THE REBELS HAVE TRIED TO BRING THE WAR TO URBAN AREAS. HOWEVER, THE PLANS OF SUBVERSIVE GROUPS--I SHOWED YOU THE DOCUMENTS ON THEIR FIRE PLAN IN ANOTHER MEETING--DID NOT INCLUDE THE TYPE OF TERRORIST ACTS THAT WE HAVE SEEN LATELY. INSTEAD, THEY PLANNED A GENERAL UPRISING AND STRIKE BEFORE THE ELECTIONS. THIS PROVES, AS I SAID, THAT THE SUBVERSIVES COULD NOT DEVELOP THEIR FIRE PLAN. THEY HAVE CARRIED OUT SEVERAL ACTS BUT THEY HAVE FAILED TO ACHIEVE THE EXPECTED RESULTS. THIS IS LIKE HAVING A CINEMA SHOW A MOVIE EVERY DAY WITH NO-ONE TURNING UP TO SEE IT. THE SUBVERSIVES ARE TRYING TO CARRY OUT THIS TYPE OF EVENT RIGHT NOW TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION OF MILITARY STRENGTH, SO THE OAS WILL PASS A RESOLUTION RECOMMENDING NEGOTIATION TO SOLVE THE CONFLICT. FURTHERMORE, THE REBELS ARE TRYING TO DISCREDIT THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND BOYCOTT OUR NEXT ELECTIONS BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE ARE DEMORALIZED BY TERRORISM AND LACK THE WILL TO PARTICIPATE IN POLITICS, WHICH MAKES THE ELECTION RESULTS UNSATISFACTORY.
TST4-MUC4-0070	LIMA, 10 NOV 88 -- LEGISLATIVE SOURCES REPORTED IN LIMA TODAY THAT THE PERUVIAN CONGRESS HAS APPROVED A BILL ESTABLISHING MORE SEVERE PENALTIES FOR TERRORISTS AND ALSO ESTABLISHING PUNISHMENTS FOR THE SUPPORT OF TERRORIST ACTS. THE BILL, WHICH WAS DISCUSSED IN THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES AND THE SENATE, ESTABLISHES PRISON TERMS RANGING FROM 10 TO 20 YEARS. IT WAS IMMEDIATELY SENT TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH FOR PROMULGATION. THE BILL WAS APPROVED 3 MONTHS AFTER PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA PRESENTED IT TO CONGRESS ON 28 JULY, WHEN GARCIA COMPLETED THE 3D YEAR OF A 5-YEAR TERM OF OFFICE WHICH BEGAN IN 1985. THE PROVISIONS APPROVED BY CONGRESS AMEND 6 ARTICLES IN SECTION 8, VOLUME 2 OF THE PERUVIAN PENAL CODE, ADDING MORE SEVERE SENTENCES AND THE MEANS FOR EXPANDING COURT ACTIONS AGAINST SUBVERSION. A PRISON TERM OF 20 YEARS OR MORE WILL BE IMPOSED ON THOSE WHO CAUSE ANXIETY, ALARM, OR TERROR AMONG THE POPULATION OR ANY PART OF IT, ACTS AGAINST A PERSON'S LIFE OR HEALTH, OR ACTS AGAINST PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY IF SUCH ACTS IMPAIR THE COMMUNITY'S BASIC SERVICES. IN ALL CASES, THE INSTIGATORS OR MASTERMINDS, THE PRINCIPALS IN THE SECOND DEGREE, AND THE ACCOMPLICES WILL RECEIVE THE SAME SENTENCES AS THE PERPETRATORS. MORE SEVERE SENTENCES HAVE ALSO BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR CASES IN WHICH A PERPETRATOR BELONGS TO AN ORGANIZATION THAT USES TERRORISM AS A MEANS TO ACHIEVE ITS GOALS, INCLUDING THE MAOIST "SHINING PATH" ORGANIZATION AND THE MRTA. SUPPORTING, APPROVING, OR PRAISING TERRORIST ACTS CAN BE PUNISHED WITH PRISON TERMS OF 5 YEARS OR MORE, AND A 5-YEAR PRISON TERM HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE CRIME OF MAKING, PURCHASING, STEALING, OR STORING WEAPONS OR EXPLOSIVES FOR THE PURPOSE OF TERRORISM. MORE THAN 12,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN PERU IN SUBVERSIVE AND ANTI-SUBVERSIVE ACTIONS SINCE THE "SHINING PATH" ORGANIZATION BEGAN ITS ARMED STRUGGLE IN 1980. MORE THAN $10 BILLION IN MATERIAL LOSSES HAVE BEEN REGISTERED AS WELL.
TST4-MUC4-0071	BOGOTA, 17 NOV 88 -- A NEW DIPLOMATIC RIFT HAS ARISEN BETWEEN COLOMBIA AND THE NEIGHBORING REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA FOLLOWING A PROTEST NOTE SENT BY OUR FOREIGN MINISTRY TO THE VENEZUELAN FOREIGN MINISTRY. THE NOTE DENOUNCES THE MASSACRE OF 14 FISHERMEN, INCLUDING TWO COLOMBIANS WHOM THE VENEZUELAN ARMED FORCES ACCUSED OF BEING SUBVERSIVES. THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT DECIDED THAT IT WOULD NOT BE SCOLDED BY COLOMBIA, SO THE VENEZUELAN FOREIGN MINISTRY SENT A NOTE TO OUR FOREIGN MINISTRY WHICH SAID THAT VENEZUELA REJECTED THE TERMS USED IN THE COLOMBIAN PROTEST NOTE. COLOMBIA HAS SENT 17 FOREIGN MINISTRY NOTES TO VENEZUELA IN THE PAST 2 YEARS, ALL CONCERNING INCIDENTS THAT HAVE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AFFECTED COLOMBIAN CITIZENS. ONLY 2 OF THE 17 PROTEST NOTES HAVE RECEIVED A REPLY, AND THEY NEVER INCLUDED THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS REQUESTED BY OUR GOVERNMENT. THE LAST NOTE REPRESENTS A PROTEST FROM OUR GOVERNMENT FOR THE MURDER OF JOSE ANTONIO AREGUA AND JUSTO PASTOR CEBALLOS ON 29 OCTOBER. THEY WERE ASSASSINATED ALONG WITH 12 VENEZUELAN CITIZENS WHEN THE VENEZUELAN ARMY MISTOOK THEM FOR NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY REBELS IN CANO COLORADA, ARAUCA DEPARTMENT, ALONG THE VENEZUELAN BORDER. EVEN THOUGH THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE VENEZUELAN AUTHORITIES MADE A MISTAKE, THE COUNTRY'S REPLY TO THE NOTE WAS SPITEFUL AND UNSATISFACTORY. THIS REPRESENTS THE WORST DIPLOMATIC INCIDENT BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES SO FAR THIS YEAR. ILDEGAR PEREZ, VENEZUELAN AMBASSADOR TO COLOMBIA, PERSONALLY REFERRED TO THE STATE OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES: LET US SAY THAT RELATIONS AT THIS POINT ARE DELICATE, BUT I WOULD NOT CHARACTERIZE THEM AS CRITICAL OR EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT HAS ORDERED THAT THE TWO SURVIVORS OF THE 29 OCTOBER MASSACRE AT THE BORDER BE TRIED. MOREOVER, THE DISPUTE BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES IS BEING EXPLOITED IN THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. VERY FEW, HOWEVER, DARE TO SPEAK THE TRUTH ABOUT THE SITUATION. WE HAVE DISPUTES AND WE SHOULD NOT COVER THEM UP. COLOMBIA AND VENEZUELA HAVE THINGS TO PROTEST ABOUT, BUT ONLY A DIALOGUE WILL LEAD TO AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE THESE DISPUTES.
TST4-MUC4-0072	BOGOTA, 21 NOV 88 -- FOUR COLOMBIAN POLICEMEN AND ONE ARMY NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER WERE KILLED TODAY IN AN AMBUSH BY NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY REBELS NEAR TAME, ARAUCA INTENDANCE. THE BODIES OF THE FIVE PEOPLE KILLED TODAY IN AN AMBUSH NEAR TAME AIRPORT, ARAUCA INTENDANCE, WERE BROUGHT TO BOGOTA. THE BODY OF A FIFTH VICTIM, RICARDO DIAZ, WAS BROUGHT TO VILLA VICENCIO AND WILL BE BURIED IN SAN CARLOS DE GUAROA, HIS BIRTHPLACE, TOMORROW. THE ONLY SURVIVOR WAS TAKEN TO THE BOGOTA POLICE CLINIC. THE OFFICIAL REPORT POINTS OUT THAT THE POLICEMEN WERE KILLED BY THE EXPLOSION OF DYNAMITE THAT HAD BEEN PLACED IN THE VEHICLE TRANSPORTING THEM FROM DOWNTOWN TAME TO THE LOCAL AIRPORT. AUTHORITIES PRESUME THE CRIMINAL ATTACK WAS PERPETRATED BY ELN REBELS.
TST4-MUC4-0073	SANTIAGO, 24 OCT 88 -- THE INFLATION `BOGEYMAN' THIS ENTIRE PANORAMA CHANGED WITH THE NO VOTE VICTORY. AND WITH IT CHANGED THE POLICIES AND TOOLS THAT BUCHI'S TEAM WILL HAVE TO RESORT TO UNTIL LATE 1989 AND THAT ARE NOW MUCH MORE DEPENDENT THAN BEFORE ON THE GOVERNMENT'S POLITICAL OBJECTIVES. ONE OPTION IS TO KEEP ON DOING "MORE OF THE SAME," TO IGNORE THE NEW CONTEXT THAT HAS DEVELOPED SINCE 5 OCTOBER, TO DEFUSE THE MONETARY TIME BOMB AND TO APPLY A TIGHT TOURNIQUET TO THE ECONOMY TO PREVENT RENEWED OUTBREAKS OF HIGHER PRICES. THE INFLATION "BOGEYMAN" IS BEGINNING TO MAKE HIS PRESENCE FELT , AND EXPLANATIONS ABOUND. GERARDO ACEITUNO, THE HEAD OF THE FORECASTING WORKSHOP OF THE LABOR ECONOMY PROGRAM, ATTRIBUTES THE MOUNTING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES TO THE IMPACT OF THE WAGE HIKE AND HIGHER INTERNATIONAL INTEREST RATES ON DOMESTIC PRICES. HE RECALLS THAT THE PRICES OF FARM PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN "VIRTUALLY FROZEN FOR A YEAR" AND THAT THIS EXPLAINS THE HUGE GAP BETWEEN THE WHOLESALE PRICE INDEX, WHICH FELL ONE PERCENT DURING THE PAST 12 MONTHS, AND THE CPI, WHICH ROSE 12 PERCENT DURING THE SAME PERIOD. "THE SITUATION COULD NOT BE SUSTAINED, EXCEPT IF BUSINESSMEN WANTED TO SACRIFICE THEIR PROFIT MARGINS, WHICH HAVE SO FAR NOT BEEN AFFECTED, BECAUSE THE VAT WAS CUT." JUAN VILLARZU, IN CONTRAST, PLACES MOST OF THE BLAME FOR THE INFLATIONARY PRESSURES ON THE EXCESSIVE QUANTITY OF MONEY. ODDLY ENOUGH, HOWEVER, THE UNCERTAINTY THAT DEVELOPED AFTER THE VICTORY OF THE NO VOTE IS PRESUMABLY HAVING AN EFFECT SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE "MINI-ADJUSTMENT." HE REPORTS THAT SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSMEN ARE POSTPONING THEIR INVESTMENT PLANS, AND THUS THEIR DEMAND FOR CREDIT HAS FALLEN OFF. THE DILEMMA FACING THEM AND OTHER "ECONOMIC AGENTS" IS WHETHER TO SPEND THE MONEY OR TO DEPOSIT IT. THE CENTRAL BANK COMES INTO PLAY HERE, BECAUSE "NOT HAVING TO COMPETE WITH THE BANKS, IT CAN BEGIN SOAKING UP SOME OF THE MONEY IN CIRCULATION WITHOUT BOOSTING INTEREST RATES TOO MUCH. MOREOVER, THEY ARE ALREADY QUITE HIGH: 5 PERCENT FOR 90-DAY OPERATIONS, AS AGAINST 4.2 PERCENT DURING THE FIRST HALF." IN ADDITION, IT COULD RESORT TO ITS SIZABLE MONETARY RESERVES AND "BURN UP" FOREIGN EXCHANGE ON HIGHER IMPORTS TO ABSORB SOME OF THE EXCESS LIQUIDITY. "I'M THINKING ABOUT DEVALUATIONS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE ONES THIS YEAR." OPTIONS AFTER THE NO VICTORY IN ANY EVENT, THE LARGE MASS OF MONEY IN CIRCULATION AND THE EXISTING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES "CONSTITUTE AN EXPLOSIVE SITUATION," WHICH ACCORDING TO VILLARZU THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT IGNORE. BECAUSE "IF IT HAS ANY POLITICAL ACCOMPLISHMENT LEFT, IT IS THE VICTORY OVER INFLATION." AND THE TIGHTENING UP WILL BE EVEN MORE SEVERE IF THE FINANCE MINISTER INSISTS ON ACHIEVING A 5-PERCENT RISE IN THE CPI IN 1989, AS THE DRAFT BUDGET SENT TO THE JUNTA CALLS FOR. EVEN THE CENTRAL BANK REGARDS THIS GOAL AS DANGEROUS. A HIGH-LEVEL CENTRAL BANK EXECUTIVE SAID THAT "IT IS VALID TO AIM FOR AN INFLATION RATE LIKE THAT IN THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, BUT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE UNEMPLOYMENT REMAINS HIGH." ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC CARD ARE THE ALREADY VISIBLE AND STRONG PRESSURES THAT THE RIGHT HAS BEGUN TO APPLY SO THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL INCREASE SPENDING IN 1989 OR AT LEAST NOT REDUCE IT. THE RIGHT ALSO WANTS THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT ARE MORE POPULIST IN NATURE OR THAT HAVE LESS VISIBLE EFFECTS ON VOTERS. SIGNIFICANTLY, EXPERTS ON BUCHI'S OWN TEAM ARE THE ONES WHO ARE ADMITTING THAT POLITICAL DEMANDS CAN BE GIVEN TO SOME EXTENT WITHOUT IGNORING CERTAIN PRINCIPLES. GAINING GROUND, AS A RESULT, ARE AN INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE AND FURTHER CUTS IN THE VAT AND IN THE TAX ON CAPITAL. BUT THE PRIVATIZATION OF ENTERPRISES IS STILL STRONGLY SUPPORTED AS WELL. EVERYTHING POINTS IN THE SAME DIRECTION: "REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE PUBLIC AND GOVERNMENT SECTOR AND, AT THE SAME TIME, NARROW THE MANEUVERING ROOM ON TAXES FOR A GOVERNMENT DIFFERENT FROM THIS ONE." IF IT IS SIMILAR, SO MUCH THE BETTER.
TST4-MUC4-0074	BOGOTA, 3 NOV 88 -- THE GUERRILLAS TURN TERRORIST THE PRESIDENT OF PATRIOTIC UNION, BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA, FEELS THAT THE SANCTION IMPOSED ON THE TWO URABA UNIONS LAST WEEK WAS UNFAIR BECAUSE HE BELIEVES THAT THE STRUGGLE OF THE WORKERS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PHENOMENON OF VIOLENCE IN THE ZONE. JARAMILLO ACKNOWLEDGED, HOWEVER, THAT THE GUERRILLA GROUPS IN URABA HAVE SHIFTED FROM SUBVERSION TO ABSURD ACTS OF TERRORISM AND VANDALISM THAT CANNOT BE COMPARED TO ACTS ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY. THE LEFTIST LEADER DESCRIBED THIS TERRORIST ESCALADE AS ONE OF THE MAJOR OBSTACLES TO THE REGION'S ACHIEVING THE SOCIAL PACT THAT IT URGENTLY NEEDS. THE CONGRESSMAN FELT THAT THE SHUTDOWN OF THE UNIONS HAS DEPRIVED THEM OF SPOKESMEN AND HE RECALLED THAT URABA HAS ACHIEVED ITS WEALTH THROUGH PRIVATE ENTERPRISE, WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT. MORE SELF-CRITICISM SENATOR ALBERTO ROJAS PUYO, ONE OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION CONGRESSMEN, CONTENDED YESTERDAY THAT THE RESIGNATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE CUT, JORGE CARRILLO, OUGHT TO HELP PROMPT THE LEFT TO MAKE A SERIES OF RECTIFICATIONS. ROJAS SAID: "JORGE CARRILLO'S LETTER OF RESIGNATION AS PRESIDENT OF THE CUT CONTAINS VERY IMPORTANT PROPOSALS NOT ONLY FOR THE ORGANIZATION BUT ALSO FOR ALL DEMOCRATIC FORCES. I AM GLAD THAT HIS RESIGNATION WAS NOT ACCEPTED AND I SEE IN THIS DEVELOPMENT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE FORCES OF THE LEFT WILL BEGIN A SERIOUS PROCESS OF REFLECTION AND NECESSARY RECTIFICATION SO THAT THEIR STRUGGLES ARE UNDERSTOOD AND TAKEN UP BY THE WORKING CLASS AND THE PEOPLE AT LARGE. "SOME OF CARRILLO'S PROPOSALS ARE, WITHOUT DOUBT, DEBATABLE, BUT THE INDISCRIMINATE MIX OF ACTIONS IS UNQUESTIONABLY DOING GREAT DAMAGE TO THE COUNTRY AND, MOST OF ALL, TO THE LEFT. A CLEAR LINE MUST BE DRAWN IN WORD AND IN DEED WITH RESPECT TO VIOLENCE. THE FACT THAT SUCH CRUCIAL ASPECTS FOR COLOMBIA'S DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT WERE DEBATED WITHIN A MAJOR LABOR FEDERATION SHOWS THAT THIS CLASS CAN PLAY A GUIDING ROLE FOR THE PEOPLE AT LARGE. "THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT ALONG WITH THE NECESSARY REFORMS, THE UNITY OF THE FEDERATION AND ITS CAPACITY FOR ALLIANCES AND GRASSROOTS MOBILIZATION EMERGE STRENGTHENED."
TST4-MUC4-0075	SAN SALVADOR, 28 NOV 88 -- COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE APPEARED BEFORE THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY TODAY. THE ASSEMBLY OFFERED TO LOOSEN LEGAL ON THE ARMED FORCES TO WIN THE WAR. SOME GROUPS BELIEVE THE COUNTRY ENTERED A CRISIS WITH THE 15 OCTOBER 1979 MILITARY COUP. SINCE THEN, EL SALVADOR HAS SUFFERED A CIVIL WAR THAT IS GETTING WORSE AND CAUSING MORE CASUALTIES. THERE ARE NOW TWO DISTURBING CHANGES IN THE WAR: FIRST, CORPSES ARE BEING DUMPED ON THE ROADSIDE, WHICH REMINDS US OF THE EARLY 1980'S WHEN DEATH SQUADS WERE ACTIVE. SECOND, URBAN GUERRILLA ACTIVITY IS INCREASING. THE ARMED FORCES ARE JUSTIFIABLY CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE ISSUES. I NEVER TALK ABOUT DEATH SQUADS. I TALK ABOUT VIOLENCE AND THE ACTIONS OF THE RIGHT- AND LEFT-WING GROUPS. THE ARMY IS DETERMINED, AND IS MAKING ALL THE NECESSARY EFFORTS, TO COUNTER THOSE VIOLENT ACTIONS, REGARDLESS OF WHICH GROUPS CARRY THEM OUT. COL PONCE MET WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY DEFENSE AND PUBLIC SECURITY COMMITTEE TODAY. AFTER 8 YEARS, THE WAR SEEMS TO BE ENDLESS. ARENA BELIEVES THAT A SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS COULD BE THE FORMATION OF A COMMON FRONT THAT WILL SET UP A NATIONAL STRATEGY AND ALSO LOOSEN LEGAL RESTRICTIONS ON THE ARMED FORCES. WE MUST SET UP A NATIONAL STRATEGY, BECAUSE WE CANNOT LET THE GUERRILLAS KILL US. I THINK THAT WE MUST ACT WITHIN THE LAW. I THINK WE MUST LOOSEN THE LEGAL RESTRICTIONS ON THE ARMY, BECAUSE THE ARMY CAN BE EFFECTIVE BUT HAS ITS HANDS TIED. IN ITS OWN COUNTRY, IT HAS BEEN REJECTED FOR HAVING DEFENDED COMMUNIST GUERRILLAS , WHICH IN ITSELF IS CONSIDERED AS . WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW CAN IT DEFEND A CRIMINAL POSITION. IT IS TIME FOR US TO RALLY AROUND A SINGLE PURPOSE. THERE CAN STILL BE A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS. CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FIDEL CHAVEZ MENA SAID HE WILL SEEK A DIALOGUE WITH THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT. MEANWHILE, ARENA WILL MAKE ITS OWN PROPOSAL TO THE FMLN. THE PDC PROMISED TO ACHIEVE PEACE. THAT IS AN ILLUSION. THAT IS WHAT THE PDC CANDIDATE IS PROPOSING. CHAVEZ MENA HAS BEEN IN THE GOVERNMENT FOR YEARS, AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT CHANGE ITS STRATEGY. THAT PROPOSAL IS MERELY A SMOKESCREEN. WE HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS. WE MUST SIT DOWN TO TALK WITH THE REBELS WITHIN A STRICT TIME LIMIT AND WITHOUT SO MUCH DEMAGOGY. WE ARE WILLING TO TALK WITH THE FMLN-FDR. WE WANT TO MAKE A PROPOSAL TO THEM--NOT AN ARENA PROPOSAL, BUT A NATIONAL PROPOSAL.
TST4-MUC4-0076	BOGOTA, 5 DEC 88 -- ...OVER THE RED TELEPHONE AND SECOND, ALL HOSTILITIES HAVE UNILATERALLY ENDED ON ALL FARC FRONTS. THE GOVERNMENT ONCE ASKED ME WHY THEY DO NOT BEGIN A UNILATERAL END OF HOSTILITIES IF THEY HAVE GOODWILL. HERE IT IS. I CANNOT DO ANY MORE; I HOPE THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT LET THIS OPPORTUNITY PASS. DO YOU BELIEVE TALKS SHOULD CONTINUE WITH THE GUERRILLA GROUPS? THE TRUTH IS THAT I PROPOSED SOMETHING TO THE GOVERNMENT, THE POLITICAL PARTIES, AND THE GUERRILLAS. WHAT YOU CALL TALKS IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE GUERRILLAS' REPLY TO THE PROPOSAL--THE SAME WAY AS DR TURBAY, SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE PARTY PRESIDENT DR FABIO VALENCIA, AND DR JARAMILLO OSSA OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION DID. THE CARDINALS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE PROPOSAL, AND THE M-19 AND FARC HAVE REPLIED. IN FACT, THEY WENT EVEN FURTHER; THEY UNILATERALLY ENDED HOSTILITIES. NOW THE BALL IS IN THE GOVERNMENT'S COURT. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT AFTER AGREEING NOT TO, FOR EXAMPLE, CARRY OUT ANY AMBUSHES AGAINST TROOPS, THE GUERRILLAS CONTINUED; THEY BROKE THE AGREEMENT. DO YOU THINK WE CAN AGAIN TRUST THESE STATEMENTS? I CANNOT MEASURE THE CONFIDENCE THAT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO OTHERS. THE ONLY THING I KNOW IS THE GOVERNMENT IS SEEKING PEACE, SO I IMAGINE THIS IS PRECISELY THE WAY. THE SUSPICION THAT THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT HAVE OF THEM IS THE SAME AS YOU MIGHT HAVE, BUT IF THE GOVERNMENT SEEKS PEACE, HERE IS WHERE THEY CAN FIND IT, WITH A PRELIMINARY END TO HOSTILITIES ON ALL FRONTS. THIS IS WHAT JACOBO ARENAS WROTE IN A LETTER THAT WAS NOT ADDRESSED TO ME BUT TO THE FORMER PRESIDENTS OF COLOMBIA.
TST4-MUC4-0077	LIMA, 2 DEC 88 -- PRESUMED SHINING PATH MAOIST EXTREMISTS AMBUSHED AND KILLED 68 PEASANTS IN THE LOCALITY OF BALCON, 200 KM NORTH OF THE SOUTHERN CITY OF AYACUCHO. A PEASANT DEFENSE PATROL UNIT WAS COMBING THE AREA IN SEARCH OF GUERRILLAS WHEN IT WAS AMBUSHED ON 22 NOVEMBER, THE NEWSPAPER EXPRESO REPORTED TODAY. THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE HAS HIT PERUVIAN TOURIST ESTABLISHMENTS IN THE CITY OF HUARAZ, CAPITAL OF THE ANCASH DEPARTMENT, WHERE FOUR INNS AND HOTELS WERE BOMBED LAST NIGHT, DAMAGING THE BUILDINGS AND INJURING AN 18 YEAR-OLD GIRL. IN CUSCO, 1,000 KM SOUTHEAST OF LIMA, A BUS HEADING TOWARD MACHU PICHU WENT OUT OF CONTROL AS THE RESULT OF SABOTAGE AND FELL INTO A 60-METER RAVINE. THE WIVES OF THE JERSEY CITY, UNITED STATES, AND CUSCO MAYORS DIED IN THIS ACCIDENT. LEFTIST SENATOR ENRIQUE BERNALES BALLESTEROS, PRESIDENT OF THE SPECIAL COMMISSION FOR THE INVESTIGATION AND STUDY OF TERRORISM AND VIOLENCE, HAS NOTED THAT THE ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE HAS CLAIMED THE LIVES OF 21 PEOPLE PER DAY DURING THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER. HE SAID THAT THE INCREASED VIOLENCE CAN BE TRACED TO ACTIONS BY THE TERRORIST GROUPS SHINING PATH AND TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT . THESE ATTACKS WERE REPRESSED BY THE FORCES OF ORDER. SENATOR BERNALES REPORTED THAT 630 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN VIOLENT ACTS IN NOVEMBER AND THAT 1,775 HAVE BEEN KILLED OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS. BERNALES SAID THAT 403 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN NOVEMBER AS A RESULT OF VIOLENT ACTS, INCLUDING 147 CIVILIANS, 165 PRESUMED TERRORISTS, 65 ARMED FORCES MEMBERS, AND 26 DRUG TRAFFICKERS. A TOTAL OF 227 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN URBAN VIOLENT ACTS. SENATOR BERNALES ADDED THAT A TOTAL OF NEARLY 13,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED SINCE THE TERRORIST VIOLENCE BEGAN IN 1980. BERNALES EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN OVER THE FACT THAT 67 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE KILLED IN VIOLENT ACTS INVOLVED YOUTHS WHO WERE BETWEEN 15 AND 29 YEARS OF AGE. HE ASKED THE GOVERNMENT TO ESTABLISH GUIDELINES TO COUNTER THIS SOCIAL PHENOMENON. AMID THIS BLOODY AND DESTRUCTIVE SITUATION, THE PERUVIAN EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE HAS MADE A CHRISTMAS APPEAL, ASKING THAT--WITHOUT IGNORING "THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION"--FOR A TRUCE "FOR PEACE, RECONCILIATION, AND TRANQUILLITY" TO PREVAIL IN THE COUNTRY. THE BISHOPS SAID: "RECALLING HE WHO PREVAILED OVER DEATH, WE CALL UPON THOSE WHO HAVE RESORTED TO VIOLENCE AND KILLINGS AS A SOLUTION TO THE EVILS OF SOCIETY, TO ALLOW THE CITIZENS FOR WHOM THEY CLAIM TO STRUGGLE TO LIVE LIKE BROTHERS."
TST4-MUC4-0078	SAN SALVADOR, 5 DEC 88 -- THE ARMY HAS REPORTED THAT IT INFLICTED 208 GUERRILLA CASUALTIES DURING CLASHES IN NOVEMBER. MEANWHILE, THE FMLN REBELS HAVE SAID THEY INFLICTED 991 CASUALTIES ON THE ARMY--INCLUDING DEAD AND WOUNDED--AS A RESULT OF THEIR ATTACKS, HARASSMENT, AND AMBUSHES DURING THE SAME PERIOD. THE MILITARY REPORT SAYS 93 FMLN GUERRILLAS WERE KILLED AND 115 WOUNDED AS A RESULT OF NATIONWIDE COUNTERINSURGENCY MILITARY OPERATIONS DURING THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER. THE REPORT ADDED THAT DURING THE SAME PERIOD, THE ARMY CONFISCATED 105 HIGH-CALIBER RIFLES, 2 M-60 MACHINEGUNS, 20 REVOLVERS OF VARIOUS CALIBERS, MORE THAN 55,000 CARTRIDGES, 168 FRAGMENTATION GRENADES, 236 MINES, 9 COMMUNICATION RADIOS, AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL FOR HOMEMADE BOMBS. THE MILITARY REPORT ADDED THAT DURING THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER, GUERRILLAS KILLED 43 PEASANTS, KIDNAPPED 32, AND CAUSED THE DEATH OF 6 PEOPLE AND CRIPPLED 23 OTHERS AS A RESULT OF MINE EXPLOSIONS. IN THE WAR AGAINST PUBLIC PROPERTY--THE PILLAR OF A WAR ECONOMY--THE MILITARY SOURCE REPORTED THAT SIX MAYORIAL OFFICES AND SIX NATIONAL ADMINISTRATION FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS OFFICES WERE DAMAGED IN VARIOUS TOWNS AND SIX JUNCTION BOXES WERE SABOTAGED. IN ADDITION, 4 TRAINS BELONGING TO THE SALVADORAN NATIONAL RAILROAD, FENADESAL, WERE BLOWN UP, AND 10 VEHICLES AND 5 BUSES WERE PARTIALLY DAMAGED. REGARDING DAMAGE TO THE ELECTRICITY SYSTEM, THE FMLN KNOCKED DOWN 46 TOWERS AND 136 HIGH-TENSION POWER POLES AND DAMAGED 11 TRANSFORMERS.
TST4-MUC4-0079	HAVANA, 3 DEC 88 -- THERE IS A SUBJECT OF INTEREST TO RADIO HAVANA LISTENERS: THE URNG'S HUMANIZATION OF THE WAR POLICY. RIGHT NOW, THE POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC COMMISSION, ON DIRECTIONS FROM THE URNG GENERAL COMMAND, IS MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO HUMANIZE THE WAR SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY BY SHOWING RESPECT FOR THE GENEVA AGREEMENT, WHICH GUATEMALA SIGNED. WE ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE THE REPRESSIVE WAR THE ARMY HAS BEEN WAGING AGAINST THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT AND THE POPULATION HAS REACHED LEVELS OF EXTREME CRUELTY, INCLUDING INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS AND THE USE OF DEFOLIANTS IN CONFLICT ZONES WHERE CIVILIANS LIVE. THERE IS THE PARTICULAR SITUATION IN WHICH NEITHER THE GUATEMALAN ARMY NOR THE GOVERNMENT TAKE ANY WAR PRISONERS. THIS MAKES US BELIEVE THAT THE CRUELTY USED AGAINST CIVILIANS AND PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE ARMED CONFLICT IS A VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. DOES THE URNG HAVE ANY PRISONERS AT THIS MOMENT? YES. WE HAVE SENT A NOTE TO THE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION COMMISSION SO IT CAN HANDLE THE CASE OF SOLDIER CARLOS PEREZ LOPEZ, WHO WAS CAPTURED WOUNDED IN THE SAN MARCOS REGION, NEAR GALVEZ. HE HAS BEEN GIVEN MUCH MEDICAL ATTENTION. NOW THAT HE HAS FULLY RECOVERED, WE ARE THINKING ABOUT PUBLICLY RETURNING THIS GUATEMALAN, AND WE ARE ASKING THE RECONCILIATION COMMISSION TO TAKE MEASURES THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS TO RECEIVE THIS MAN IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE HUMANIZATION PROCESS. WILL THIS BE THE FIRST TIME THE URNG WILL MAKE THIS KIND OF CONTACT WITH THE IRC? THE IRC HAS HAD LOCALIZATION PROBLEMS. THERE HAS BEEN THE ARGUMENT THAT THERE IS A NATIONAL RED CROSS. CONTACT WITH THE IRC IS POSSIBLE IF THERE IS A PRESENCE OF THIS ORGANIZATION THAT FUNCTIONS BASED ON INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS. NOW THAT THE IRC IS PRESENT, THE WORK IS BEING FACILITATED. THE CONTACT WITH THE IRC IS AT THE INITIATION LEVEL. HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THESE CONTACTS WILL BE VERY USEFUL IN THE FUTURE, ESPECIALLY FOR PERSONS NOT INVOLVED IN THE ARMED CONFLICT. I THINK IT WOULD BE USEFUL IF WE CLOSE THIS INTERVIEW WITH YOU REPEATING THE NAME OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMY SOLDIER WHO IS BEING HELD BY THE URNG AND WHOM THE GUERRILLA FORCES ARE PREPARED TO TURN OVER TO THE IRC. YES. HIS NAME IS CARLOS LOPEZ PEREZ . THANK YOU, VILLAGRAN.
TST4-MUC4-0080	BOGOTA, 15 NOV 88 -- IT WAS BARELY NOON WHEN A MAN WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED ON A FLIGHT FROM MEDELLIN WENT INTO THE NATIONAL BOOKSTORE TO BUY SOME NEWSPAPERS. MEANWHILE, HIS BODYGUARD-CHAUFFEUR WAITED FOR HIM IN THE LOBBY. THE MAN WITH THE NEWSPAPERS, A CATTLEMAN NAMED GUSTAVO DE JESUS ESCOBAR FERNANDEZ, HAD JUST LEFT THE BOOKSTORE WHEN THE TROUBLE STARTED. ESCOBAR WAS PREPARING TO GO TO HIS CAR WHEN A MAN APPROACHED HIM. THE MAN, AROUND 35 YEARS OLD AND 5 FEET 9 INCHES TALL, TOOK OUT A 7.65 CALIBER PISTOL AND BEGAN FIRING. PANIC SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE TERMINAL AS PEOPLE THREW THEMSELVES ON THE FLOOR TO AVOID BEING SHOT. ESCOBAR IMMEDIATELY FELL TO THE FLOOR AS HIS ATTACKER TRIED TO ESCAPE THROUGH ONE OF THE EXITS. APPARENTLY, HE DID NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE PRESENCE OF THE BODYGUARD, WHO HAD ENOUGH TIME TO DRAW HIS GUN AND SHOOT THE AGGRESSOR, WHO DIED AT THE SCENE. ESCOBAR FERNANDEZ WAS TAKEN TO THE SAN PEDRO CLAVER CLINIC, WHERE HE WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD ON ARRIVAL. BUT THE TRAGIC EVENT DID NOT END THERE. A 20-YEAR-OLD WOMAN WHO WAS AT THE AIRPORT, MARIA FLOREZ GUTIERREZ, WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED AND HER CONDITION WAS LISTED AS SERIOUS WHEN THIS EDITION WENT TO PRINT. EARLY DETAILS DID NOT CLARIFY THE MOTIVATION FOR THE ATTACK. ACCORDING TO DOCUMENTS FOUND IN HIS CLOTHING, IN ADDITION TO HIS ACTIVITIES AS A CATTLEMAN, GUSTAVO DE JESUS ESCOBAR WAS A LEGAL ADVISOR IN CONGRESS, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS DENIED BY SPOKESMEN FROM THAT INSTITUTION. THINGS TOOK ANOTHER TURN THAT EVENING, WHEN THE TELEVISION NEWS PROGRAM 24 HOURS REPORTED THAT ESCOBAR FERNANDEZ WAS THE COUSIN OF PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA. THIS GAVE RISE TO THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE ATTACK WAS LINKED TO THE SERIES OF KILLINGS IN THE SO-CALLED "CARTEL WAR." AS TO THE ATTACKER, NEITHER HIS REAL MOTIVES NOR HIS IDENTITY WERE KNOWN AT THE END OF THE WEEK.

THE OFFICIAL ADDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF THE POLITICIANS OR GUERRILLAS WHO ATTEND THE REGIONAL TALKS WHICH ARE TAKING PLACE IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. THE PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER ALSO WARNED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT CHANGE ITS ATTITUDE TOWARD THE REBELS AND THAT ANY MEETINGS IN SEARCH OF PEACE WILL ONLY TAKE PLACE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLA LEADERS. EVEN THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT RESPONDED TO SENATOR ALVARO LEIVA'S PROPOSAL, WHICH CALLS FOR A TOP-LEVEL COMMISSION TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE GUERRILLAS, THE FARC AND THE M-19 GUERRILLAS HAVE ALREADY ANNOUNCED THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT CALLS FOR THE CREATION OF SUCH A COMMISSION, THEY WOULD IMMEDIATELY ORDER A TRUCE. THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT ASSUME THAT RESPONSIBILITY WITH PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS. OUR PEACE INITIATIVE CALLS FOR A DIRECT DIALOGUE WITH GUERRILLAS WHO ARE COMMITTED TO A RECONCILIATION, ONCE THE RIGHT CONDITIONS ARE PRESENT. THIS POSITION REMAINS UNCHANGED. DOES THIS MEAN SENATOR ALVARO LEIVA'S PROPOSAL HAS NOT BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT? NO, THE GOVERNMENT WILL RESPOND TO DR LEIVA'S PROPOSAL IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. HIS PROPOSAL HAS BROUGHT ABOUT POSITIVE RESULTS IN THE SENSE THAT THE FARC AND M-19 HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR DESIRE TO SUSPEND TERRORIST ACTS. THE GOVERNMENT WILL ANNOUNCE A FORMAL RESPONSE TO THIS PROPOSAL IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. MEANWHILE, FORMER PRESIDENTS BELISARIO BETHANCOURT AND MISAEL PASTRANA BORRERO URGED THAT A COMMISSION BE FORMED FOR TALKS WITH THE REBELS, WHICH THEY CONSIDER THE BEST CHANCE FOR PEACE.

THE FMLN ALSO CLAIMS THAT IN MANY TOWNS IN NORTHERN AND EASTERN EL SALVADOR, AN AREA OVER WHICH IT CLAIMS TO HAVE MORE CONTROL THAN THE ARMY, THERE ARE TWO POWER CENTERS: ONE IS THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT, AND THE OTHER IS THE GOVERNMENT. THE FMLN HAS STATED THAT IT WILL NOT ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL THAT REGION. THUS FAR THIS YEAR, THE FMLN HAS KILLED EIGHT PDC AND RIGHTIST NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE MAYORS IN SANTA ANA, MORAZAN, SAN MIGUEL, AND USULUTAN DEPARTMENTS.

TST4-MUC4-0089	SANTIAGO, 10 NOV 88 -- VARYING INTENTIONS THE PROGRAM FOR LEGAL ACTION CERTAINLY RAISES DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS AMONG THE PARTNERS IN IU. THERE HAS BEEN TALK ABOUT THAT IN RECENT DAYS. ALL INDICATIONS ARE, INDEED, THAT BECAUSE TIME IS RUNNING SHORT THEY WILL START UP WITHOUT MUCH CIRCUMSPECTION. TO PUT IT MORE CLEARLY, THE PRESUMPTION IS THAT THEY WILL WAIT UNTIL THINGS ARE UNDER WAY BEFORE TRYING TO PUT THEIR OWN MARK ON THE NEWBORN. CHRISTIAN LEFT WAS THE FIRST TO GIVE THIS SIGNAL. THE RESOLUTIONS OF ITS PLENUM, MADE PUBLIC ON 28 OCTOBER, CLEARLY REVEALED THAT IT INTENDED TO UNIFY THE ENTIRE LEFT IN THE FORMATION OF THE NEW POLITICAL ENTITY. IN PASSING, THEY SENT A MESSAGE TO THEIR MEN WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE PPD : THEY HAVE TO DECIDE BETWEEN MEMBERSHIP IN ONE OR THE OTHER, BUT NOT BOTH. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MAPU -BARRUETO IS NOT ADDRESSING WITH THE SAME EARNESTNESS. THEY APPARENTLY SEEK TO TAKE PART IN EVERY GROUP THERE IS, WHETHER IT IS CALLED THE PPD, COSONO OR LEFTIST PARTY. THE CHRISTIAN LEFT PEOPLE WENT EVEN FURTHER. AT NO TIME DID THEY CONCEAL THEIR WISH THAT LUIS MAIRA PRESIDE OVER THE NEW PARTY. THE PLENUM OF THE SOCIALIST PARTY -ALMEYDA WAS, OF COURSE, THE MOST EAGERLY ANTICIPATED. AS ON OTHER OCCASIONS, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO SET THE TONE FOR THE JOCKEYING BY THE LEFT. THEY AMBITIOUSLY FELT THAT THIS WAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMOVE SOME STRATEGIC OBSTACLES, SORT OF LIKE KILLING TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE: REGISTRATION AND THE SOUGHT-AFTER SOCIALIST UNITY. PERHAPS THIS IS WHY THEY HELD THEIR PLENUM, WHERE ON 28 AND 29 OCTOBER THEY DISCUSSED THE ADVANTAGES OF REGISTERING THEIR OWN PARTY, IN OTHER WORDS, RESPONDING ONCE AND FOR ALL TO THE INITIATIVES OF THE NUNEZES, WHO TOOK OVER THE PPD, THE ONLY LEGALLY RECOGNIZED SOCIALIST GROUP. OTHERS THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE WISER TO PROMOTE A PARTY IN THE "SOCIALIST SPACE," BRING TOGETHER THERE CHRISTIAN LEFT, MAPU-BARRUETO AND THE SMALL SOCIALIST GROUPS THAT STILL EXIST, IN OTHER WORDS, COSONO AS A PARTY. THIS STAND OBVIOUSLY GAVE PRIORITY TO SOMETHING OF A LEADING POLITICAL ROLE AND KEPT THE PC AT A DISTANCE. THE OPTION OF REGISTERING A BROAD LEFT-WING GROUP WAS ALSO RAISED AT THE PLENUM; TO MANY THIS ENTAILED A CERTAIN "SACRIFICE" OF PREDOMINANCE BY THE SOCIALISTS. THE PS-ALMEYDA ULTIMATELY OPTED FOR A "CONSENSUS" VOTE, OF WHOSE PUBLIC VERSION THERE WERE SEVERAL INTERPRETATIONS. THERE WAS TALK OF "THE REGISTRATION OF A LEGAL INSTRUMENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SOCIALIST SPACE AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE GRASSROOTS FORCES AND OF THE PROGRESSIVE AND LEFTIST INDEPENDENTS WHO HAVE SO FAR BELONGED TO UNLEGALIZED PARTIES." THE INTENTION OF THE SOCIALIST LANGUAGE WAS CLEAR, BUT THE PARTY DID NOT CLOSE RANKS WITH A BROAD LEFT-WING ALLIANCE. THE EMPHASIS WAS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER. WHAT WAS NOT MADE PUBLIC WAS THAT THE POLITICAL VOTE OF "THE MORE THAN 50 AND FEWER THAN 100 PARTICIPANTS" SPOKE OF GIVING PRIORITY TO SOCIALIST LEADERSHIP IN THE NEW PARTY. THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOW FOCUSING ON THIS.
TST4-MUC4-0090	SAN SALVADOR, 19 DEC 88 -- SANTA ANA -- URBAN GUERRILLAS OPERATING IN SANTA ANA HAVE CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MURDER OF ROSA IMELDA GONZALEZ MEDRANO, A PROFESSOR AT THE WESTERN CAMPUS OF THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY.

THEY ADDED THAT HER DEATH WAS A "REVOLUTIONARY EXECUTION" BECAUSE SHE WAS CONSIDERED A TRAITOR TO THE ORGANIZATION. GONZALEZ MEDRANO WAS KILLED ON THE NIGHT OF 16 DECEMBER, ON 13TH AVENUE SOUTH, 11TH STREET EAST IN THE SAN RAFAEL NEIGHBORHOOD, WHEN SHE WAS RETURNING FROM A DEMONSTRATION SPONSORED BY THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, SAN SALVADOR CAMPUS.

TST4-MUC4-0091	SANTIAGO, 19 DEC 88 -- MILITARY SOURCES TODAY REPORTED THAT THREE CHILEAN ARMY OFFICERS, ONE OF THEM THE COMMANDER OF A REGIMENT, HAVE DIED IN A HELICOPTER ACCIDENT DURING A PATROL OPERATION.

TST4-MUC4-0093	BOGOTA, 14 DEC 88 -- IN THE LAST FEW DAYS OF THIS YEAR, THE NATION HAS BEEN DISCUSSING PEACE IN A WAY SELDOM HEARD OF BEFORE. ALL COLOMBIANS, INCLUDING ILLUSTRIOUS FORMER PRESIDENTS, THE MEDIA, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, POLITICAL PARTIES, THE REBELS, AND THE NATION AT LARGE, HAVE BEEN VOICING THEIR STRONG DESIRE FOR RECONCILIATION IN THE HOMELAND. WE REBELS HAVE ALWAYS REGARDED PEACE HIGHLY. THIS IS WHY WE HAVE ALWAYS CLEARLY REITERATED THIS IDEA. TO SET THE PROPER FRAME OF MIND, WE WILL RECALL WHAT WAS SAID IN THE LA URIBE AGREEMENT ON 28 MARCH 1984: "TO ENSURE PEACE IN THE NATION--WHICH IS AN ESSENTIAL PREREQUISITE FOR THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE'S PROSPERITY--AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BASED ON LIBERTY AND JUSTICE, THE FOLLOWING IS HEREBY AGREED UPON. "1. THE FARC AND EP WILL ORDER A CEASE-FIRE AND THE SUSPENSION OF ALL MILITARY OPERATIONS IN ALL FRONTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AS OF 0000 ON 28 MAY 1984. "2. THE FARC AND EP WILL AGAIN CONDEMN AND NOT ALLOW KIDNAPPINGS, EXTORTION, AND TERRORISM IN ALL THEIR FORMS. FARC-EP WILL HELP ELIMINATE THESE PRACTICES BECAUSE THEY ARE AN ATTACK ON LIBERTY AND HUMAN DIGNITY." IN ADDITION, THE M-19 AND EPL REACHED THE FOLLOWING AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT: "... WE BELIEVE THE CESSATION OF ARMED CLASHES BETWEEN GOVERNMENT FORCES AND THE REBELS IS AN ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL REFORMS THAT THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE NEED AND DESIRE. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE HIGHEST INTERESTS OF THE HOMELAND, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS HAVE REACHED THE FOLLOWING AGREEMENT: THE NEGOTIATION AND DIALOGUE COMMISSION, THE EPL GENERAL COMMAND, AND THE M-19 HIGH COMMAND HAVE AGREED ON A CEASE-FIRE. ONCE THIS IS CARRIED OUT, A GREAT NATIONAL DIALOGUE WILL BEGIN, DEVELOP, AND CONCLUDE. THROUGH THIS DIALOGUE, ALL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SECTORS WILL BE ABLE TO EXPRESS THEIR WILLINGNESS TO SEARCH FOR PEACE BASED ON SOCIAL JUSTICE. "CONSEQUENTLY, THE EPL GENERAL COMMAND AND THE M-19 HIGH COMMAND HEREBY ORDER ALL FRONTS, COLUMNS, AND UNITS TO CEASE FIRING AND SUSPEND ALL MILITARY OPERATIONS AS OF 1300 ON 30 AUGUST." THE SPIRIT AND THE LETTER OF THESE ACCORDS IS NOW WORTH CONSIDERING. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN COLOMBIANS SAID THESE ACCORDS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS HAD BECOME THE COUNTRY'S NEW POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY. THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR USELESS RECRIMINATIONS, BUT FOR A SERIOUS EFFORT TO DETERMINE WHO IS TO BLAME BECAUSE THE ACCORDS WENT PARTIALLY UNFULFILLED. ANYWAY, CONSIDERING THESE ACCORDS WILL NOT HARM THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY. WE HEREBY REAFFIRM OUR WILLINGNESS TO TALK WITH YOUR GOVERNMENT TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE COUNTRY'S PROBLEMS. THIS WILLINGNESS TO TALK IS SHARED BY ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE SIMON BOLIVAR GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD AND IS PART OF THE CONCLUSIONS REACHED BY THREE GUERRILLA SUMMIT MEETINGS. WE FULLY AGREE WITH THE PEACE PROPOSAL PRESENTED BY SENATOR ALBERTO LEYVA DURAN. WE FIND IT CLEAR, SIMPLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, AND COMPLETE. THIS IS WHY WE WROTE THIS LETTER, MADE OUR LATEST STATEMENTS, AND HAVE GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS FOR A UNILATERAL CEASE-FIRE AS THE BEST CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR OUR PEOPLE. MANUEL MARULANDA VELEZ, JACOBO ARENAS, ALFONSO CANO, RAUL REYES, TIMOLEON JIMENEZ FARC GENERAL STAFF, SIMON BOLIVAR GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD
TST4-MUC4-0094	LIMA, 20 DEC 88 -- THE PERUVIAN GOVERNING PARTY, APRA, TODAY ENDED A CONFLICTIVE PARTY CONGRESS ON A NOTE OF DEFEAT FOR PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA, AND WITH THE EMERGENCE OF FORMER PRIME MINISTER LUIS ALVA CASTRO AS NEW PARTY LEADER. THE APRA CONGRESS ELIMINATED THE POST OF PARTY PRESIDENT, WHICH WAS CREATED FOR ALAN GARCIA IN 1985, CONSOLIDATING HIS POSITION AS PARTY LEADER FOLLOWING A DECISIVE VICTORY IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF THAT YEAR. ACCORDING TO SOME CRITICS WITHIN THE PARTY, THE PERSONALISM THAT HAD CHARACTERIZED GARCIA'S UNDISPUTED LEADERSHIP SINCE 1982 WAS THUS ENDED. LUIS ALVA CASTRO, 46, FORMER PRIME MINISTER AND ECONOMY MINISTER AS WELL AS FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES, WAS ELECTED BY A LARGE MARGIN AS THE NEW SECRETARY GENERAL, A POST WHICH REGAINED THE HIGHEST STATUS IN THE PARTY. ALVA CASTRO CAPITALIZED ON THE INTERNAL DISSIDENCE AND ON THE PARTY'S DISENCHANTMENT WITH ALAN GARCIA AS A RESULT OF THE DETERIORATION OF THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION, WHICH IS CONSIDERED THE WORST CRISIS IN THIS CENTURY AND IS BLAMED ON THE CHIEF OF STATE'S "STUBBORNNESS" IN NOT CHANGING HIS NATIONALISTIC AND POPULIST POLICY LINE." THE NEW CADRE ELECTED AT THE 16TH APRA CONGRESS IS IN FAVOR OF A "CHANGE IN ORIENTATION" IN THE PARTY'S MANAGEMENT AND IN THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION FOR THE REMAINING 18 MONTHS OF THE APRA'S TERM IN OFFICE. IT IS EXPECTED THAT ALAN GARCIA AND ALVA CASTRO MAY REACH AN AGREEMENT ON THE WAY THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE RUN UNTIL 1990, WHEN THE CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL TERM WILL END FOLLOWING NEW GENERAL ELECTIONS. GARCIA ALSO LOST THE PRESIDENCY OF THE POLITICAL COMMISSION THAT SETS THE PARTY'S POLITICAL LINE. THIS POST WAS WON BY LUIS ALBERTO SANCHEZ, 88, FIRST VICE PRESIDENT OF THE NATION AND ONE OF THE MAINSPRINGS IN THE CHANGEOVER OPERATION WITHIN THE APRA. THE OTHER ELECTIVE POSITIONS WERE FILLED WITH APRA MEMBERS WHO DO NOT FOLLOW GARCIA'S LINE. THUS, THE PRESENCE OF ALAN GARCIA WITHIN THE PARTY WAS REDUCED TO BEING MEMBER OF THE POLITICAL COMMISSION IN HIS CAPACITY AS FORMER PARTY SECRETARY GENERAL. TWO DAYS AGO, THE PERUVIAN CHIEF OF STATE RESIGNED THE APRA PRESIDENCY, UPSET OVER CRITICISM DIRECTED AT HIM DURING THE OPENING OF THE PARTY CONGRESS. HE THUS RESPONDED TO OBVIOUS SIGNS THAT THE PARTY PRESIDENT POST WOULD BE ELIMINATED. THE APRA HAD THOUGHT ALAN GARCIA WOULD BE A VERY CAPABLE HEIR TO VICTOR RAUL HAYA DE LA TORRE, THE PARTY'S FOUNDER AND HISTORICAL LEADER, WHO DIED IN 1979. THREE AND ONE-HALF YEARS AFTER GARCIA'S ELECTION VICTORY, THE PARTY DISQUALIFIED GARCIA FOR THE ROLE OF HAYA DE LA TORRE'S SUCCESSOR BECAUSE OF HIS ERRORS AND HIS FAILURE TO RECTIFY HIS GOVERNMENT LINE. FOLLOWING THE TRADITION INITIATED BY ALAN GARCIA, NEW APRA LEADER LUIS ALVA CASTRO WILL BE SWORN IN AS SECRETARY GENERAL THIS COMING FRIDAY BEFORE THE TOMB OF HAYA DE LA TORRE IN THE NORTHERN CITY OF TRUJILLO, THE APRA'S MAIN BASTION. THE ECONOMIC CRISIS, MARKED BY 2,000-PERCENT INFLATION AND A 20-PERCENT RECESSION FROM OCTOBER 1987 TO OCTOBER 1988, IS COMPOUNDED BY SOCIAL INSTABILITY AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE, WITH KILLINGS AVERAGING FOUR PER DAY. AN INTERNAL POLITICAL STORM HIT THE APRA 16TH NATIONAL CONGRESS, AND VICE PRESIDENT SANCHEZ SAID THAT HE CANNOT RECALL ANYTHING SIMILAR. DURING THE LAST SESSION OF THE CONGRESS, THREE YOUTHS WERE INJURED IN A MELEE AMONG APRA PEOPLE. OTHER PARTY MEMBERS WERE HIT ON THE HEAD WITH HANDGUN BUTTS, AND THREE NEWSMEN--WHO HAD NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO ATTEND THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONGRESS--WERE ATTACKED.

THEY DID NOT DAMAGE THE GARRISONS OR INFLICT ANY CASUALTIES. WHILE THE REBELS ATTACKED THE GARRISONS, ANOTHER GROUP ATTACKED THE CEL SAN LUIS SUBSTATION, 3 KM NORTH OF SANTA ANA. THEY CAUSED MINOR DAMAGE TO THE CONTROL ROOM WITH EXPLOSIVES. THIS PLANT DISTRIBUTES ALL OF THE ELECTRICITY FOR THE COUNTRY'S WESTERN AREA, SO THE DAMAGE WAS REPAIRED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF CEL ENGINEERS.
TST4-MUC4-0096	RIO DE JANEIRO , 22 DEC 88 -- SAO PAULO FEDERAL POLICE HAVE SEIZED TWO DRUG TRAFFICKERS CARRYING 160 KILOGRAMS OF COCAINE. THIS IS THE LARGEST DRUG SEIZURE THIS YEAR IN SAO PAULO.
